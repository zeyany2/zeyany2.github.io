Specifies Model Check Options
Main Index
Remarks:
1.The MODEL_CHECK statement is ignored in RESTART runs.
2.The values specified for material properties using the MODEL_CHECK statement will be used to
temporarily update data for all  MAT1, MAT2, MAT3, MAT8, and MAT9 Bulk Data entries only
for the duration of the run.  These values do not replace data specified on the MATi Bulk Data
entries.  Caution should be used when postprocessing results via the PARAM POST options since
operations using inconsistent data could be performed. Furthermore, when layered composite
element properties and materials (PSHELL and MAT2 MID1/MID2/MID3/MID4) are generated,
these equivalent MAT2 property entries are not considered to be original input data and the effects
of the MODEL_CHECK directives are permanently reflected in these MAT2 properties. Restarts
should not be attempted in this case.
3.System default values of 0.0 have been defined for each of the properties.  The defaults can be changed
using the following Nastran statement keywords:  DEF_DENS for MAT_DENSITY, DEF_TECO
for MAT_TECO, DEF_TEIJ for MAT_TEIJ, and DEF_DAMP for MAT_DAMPING.
4.The MAT_TECO describer causes the direct components of the thermal expansion coefficient to be
modified.  The MAT_TEIJ describer causes the shear components of the thermal expansion
coefficient to be modified.
5.The CHECKOUT option has the same effect as a PARAM,CHECKOUT,YES Bulk Data entry.
6.The following table summarizes the acceptable specifications for the PRINT item_list.MAT_DAMPING Selects material structural element damping processing option.
Value to be used for the structural element damping coefficient.
OFF Sets material property value to zero.
DEFAULT Material property value is set to system default value. See Remark 3.
CHECKOUT Selects model checkout solution option. See Remark 5.
PRINT Selects items to be printed during model checkout solution.
item_list List of model data items to be printed during model checkout run. If more than
one item is specified, enclose the list in parenthesis. See Remark 6.

Main Index
Remarks:
1.If SOLIN keyword is not given and if there are no LINK statements within the input data, the
program will perform an automatic link. The program will first collect the objects created in the
current run by the COMPILE statement and the remaining objects stored in the MSCOBJ DBset.
The program will  then perform an automatic link of the collected objects.
2.If the SOLIN keyword is not given but a LINK statement is provided, the SOLIN default will be
obtained from the SOLOUT keyword on the LINK statement.
3.The operation sequence control array (OSCAR) defines the problem solution sequence. The OSCAR
consists of a sequence of entries with each entry containing all of the information needed to execute
one step of the problem solution. The OSCAR is generated from information supplied by the user’s
entries in the Executive Control Section.
4.The SOLIN keyword will skip the automatic link and execute the OSCAR on the specified DBset.
5.The DOMAINSOLVER may be used in conjunction with solution sequences 101, 103, 108, and
111 to select domain decomposition solution methods.

&lt;p&gt;SOL 700,ID
Executes MSC Nastran Explicit Nonlinear (SOL 700)154
Main Index
Format:
SOL 700,ID PATH= STOP= NP(or DMP700)= FSIDMP= INTELMPI=
Examples:
SOL 700,129 PATH=3 NP=4
(700,129 request nonlinear transient dynamics, path=3 requests use of the SOL 700 script called out in file
sol700.pth, np=4 requests that 4 processors be used)
Summary:
SOL 700 is an Executive Control statement like SOL that activates an explicit nonlinear transient analysis
integration scheme. The calculations will not be performed directly within MSC Nastran.  Instead, SOL 700
will use a separate solver spawned from MSC Nastran.
The SOL 700 statement will spawn an executable which is a 3D, explicit nonlinear analyses code DMP
(distributed memory parallel processing domain decomposition) capabilities.
For ID=129 or NLTRAN, SOL 700 will generate an intermediate input data file, jid.dytr.dat, where “jid” is
the name of the MSC Nastran input file without the extension). For example, if the MSC Nastran input file
is named abcd.dat, (or abcd.bdf) then “jid”=abcd).
Unless specified differently using the STOP=3  option, the executable will be executed from MSC Nastran
on any computer system capable of doing so (which includes most Linux systems and Windows systems). For
it to run, it must be installed, properly licensed, and accessible from the directory where the MSC Nastran
input data resides, MSC_BASE must be provided in the environment.
Nastran SOL 700 Update:
Starting in MSC Nastran 2019 .0 there is a change in the execution of MSC Nastran SOL 700. SOL 700 with
LS-Dyna is no longer supported by MSC Nastran. Instead, a new explicit solver is introduced in MSC
Nastran 2019. 0. This version can be activated by adding VERSION = PRIMARY to SOL 700 in the input
file or simply by leaving it blank as this will be the default. A new license feature will be needed to run this
new version: NA_Explicit_Dytran.
The new SOL 700 will support both DMP and SMP parallelization. For this, the solver will pull licenses
from the following license feature: NA_Parallel.
Customers that have a lease agreement will no longer be able to run MSC Nastran SOL 700 jobs from version
of MSC Nastran before 2018.0. The binaries needed were in the prior version located in msc 20223/ dytran
directory of the MSC Nastran installation. However, this directory will be missing after the installation of
MSC Nastran 2022.3.
Paid-up customers of MSC Nastran before 2018. 0 can continue to use MSC Nastran SOL 700 jobs from
version of MSC Nastran before 2018. 0. For those customers, there will be no change in the FlexLM License
features.SOL 700,ID Executes MSC Nastran Explicit Nonlinear (SOL 700)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;155 SOL 700,ID
Executes MSC Nastran Explicit Nonlinear (SOL 700)
Main Index
Executive Control Parameters:
The required ID may be one of several valid solution sequence integers or names shown in Table 2 for the SOL
statement. Examples are 129 and NLTRAN.
The following solutions are available: 101, 106, 109, 129 (and their equivalent names).
All items on the SOL 700,ID after ID itself may be specified by environmental variables. This may be done
any way environmental variables can be set. They may be set by the MSC Nastran user at run time or by the
system administrator when MSC Nastran is installed. Any values specified on the SOL statement override
those in the environment. Environmental variables are fully described in the . A keywords file is available to
describe the format of each variable. The variable is normally set in the system-wide rc file, a user’s rc file, a
local rc file or in a script used to submit MSC Nastran.
The following describes the various options for PATH. We suggest that PATH=3 for all computer systems.
PATH=1 (Windows Only)
If PATH=1  is specified, MSC Nastran will determine the proper command to execute a serial run . To aid
MSC Nastran in determining where Dytran is located, the dynrun.pth  file must be located in the same
directory where the MSC Nastran input file resides. The dynrun.pth file must contain one line providing the
location (complete path) of the SOL 700 run script. A typical example of the line in the file dynrun.pth
follows.
A string is appended to this path to form the complete command used to execute the SOL 700 executable.
“dytran jid=name.dytr.dat”
For Windows, MSC Nastran will spawn the external executable using the following command assuming the
MSC Nastran input data is named enf2e.dat. (Although the example appears like it is on multiple lines, it is
actually on a single line.)
c:\sol700/dytran jid=enf2e.dytr.dat
PATH=3 (All Systems)
If PATH=3  is specified, a script or batch file located in the same directory as the SOL 700 executable will be
executed. The name of the executable is dytran (linux) or dytran.exe (Windows). This directory and name of
the script is determined by the first line in a file named sol700.pth which must be in the same directory as
the Nastran input file. Options are specified on subsequent lines of the sol700.pth file. For example, if
Nastran is installed in C:\Program Files\MSC.Software\MSC_Nastran\ 20223 , the dytran.exe
location is C:\Program Files\MSC.Software\MSC_Nastran\ 2022.3\msc20223
\dytran\win64\bin\dytran . T o use sol700.pth  file, the first line must be C:\Program
Files\MSC.Software\MSC_Nastran\ 20223\msc20223\dytran\win64\bin\dytranWindows c:\sol700\&lt;/p&gt;

Available PATH=3 options for Windows PC systems are as follows:
A Windows example of the file sol700.pth for the PATH=3 case follows.
C:\MSC.Software\MSC_Nastran\ 20223\msc20223\dytran\win64\bin\dytran nastran
nproc=4
For the above example, MSC Nastran will create the following command to spawn the SOL 700 executable
assuming your input file is named abcd.dat. (Although the example appears like it is on multiple lines, it is
actually on a single line.)
C:\Program Files\MSC.Software\MSC_Nastran\ 20223\msc20223\dytran\win64\bin\dytran
nastran nproc=6
Available PATH=3 options for Linux systems follows:exe= The full path to the executable that is to be used.
Optional &amp;ndash; If exe= is omitted, the directory where the script or batch file resides (first line of
sol700.pth) will be used and dytran for Linux and dytran.exe for windows will be appended. If
exe= is used, it must be the second line in the sol700.pth file.
nproc Number of processors.  (only for DMP run)
(Default is to used NP on the SOL 700 line. If NP and nproc are omitted, the default is 1). For
parallel execution, the directory where the MSC Nastran input file exists must be shared with
read/write privileges. If wdir is used, it must also be shared (see below). The directory where
the Dytran e xecutable resides must also be shared for parallel execution.
ncpus Number of processors. (only for SMP)
(Default is not used.) If ncpus is greater than 1 in sol700.pth, Nastran SOL 700 automatically
uses SMP capability.
bat Run in background or foreground (Default).
hlist Host file name. Name of a hostfile containing the same information as “machine”
The format of hostfile is as follows for the example for machine:
machine1 2
machine1 4
intelmpi To activate the I ntel M PI set intelmpi equal to yes. Default is no. If intelmpi=yes i s placed
directly on the command line (not in sol700.pth) Intel M PI will be activated too.
atb the name of atb file.
imm the name of imm file.
debug Specifying debug=yes indicates if you want to keep scratch files and other debug
information to investigate when a job fails to run. Default is no.
exe The full path to the executable for Dytran t hat is to be used. (Optional)
fsidmp Specifying fsidmp=yes indicates to run the FSI Distributed Memory Parallel version.
Default is no.  If FSIDMP=YES is placed directly on the command line (not in sol700.pth)
FSI Distributed Memory Parallel will be activated too.&lt;/p&gt;

Main Index
A Linux example of the file sol700.pth for the PATH=3 case is as follows:
/app/msc/ msc20223/dytran/linux64/bin/dytran nastran  nproc=4
For the above example, MSC Nastran will create the a command similar to the following to spawn the SOL
700 executable a ssuming your input file is named abcd.dat
/app/msc/ msc20223/dytran/linux64/bin/dytran nastran nproc=4&lt;br&gt;
If PATH is not specified, the default search path will be used to locate the dytran executable. This version
will be located in a subdirectory named dytran/machine below the MSC Nastran base directory
(MSC_BASE).  Not all PATH=3 options are available using this default path option.
STOP
STOP is an optional item. STOP is used to prevent execution of Dytran o r prevent execution of MSC
Nastran after IFP if so desired. The various options are as follows:
STOP=1
If STOP=1 MSC Nastran will gracefully stop after IFP .  This option is used to prevent MSC Nastran from
performing its own solution (normally used when the solution is performed with ID=129).&lt;br&gt;
STOP=3
STOP=3 MSC Nastran is stopped after IFP and Dytran i s not executed. This would be the normal STOP
option if the user wants to examine the intermediate input file, make some changes and then execute Dytran
manually.
The following files are potentially affected by the COPYR option:
NP(or DMP700)=the Number of Processors
NP(or DMP700)=the number of processors  (domains) for parallel processing. The default is one. In order to
use more than one domain, MPI, Lam, POE, or whatever parallel program is needed must be properly
installed on all computers involved and a hostfile designating which computers are to be used for each domain hlist The (local) filename containing the hosts list. If this file is not given or not found, a default
local hosts list is used. Note that the MPI universe in which the selected nodes and CPUs
reside is expected to exist and be accessible (i.e., be booted).
nproc Number of processors. (only for DMP run)
(Default is to use NP on the SOL 700 line. If NP and nproc are omitted, the default is 1.)
NOTE: The number of requested processes must be a power of 2.
ncpus Number of processors. (only for SMP)
(Default is not used.) If ncpus is greater than 1 in sol700.pth, Nastran SOL 700
automatically uses SMP capability.
atb the name of atb file.
imm the name of imm file.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;IMPGEOM
Defines Geometric Imperfection1948
Main Index
Remarks:
1.All IMPGEOM identification numbers must be unique. An IMPGEOM entry is referenced by
IMPERFECT case control directly or by an IMPCASE bulk entry.
2.Geometric imperfection effect is applied to grid points as coordinates variation, the variation is
superposed by eigenvectors of multiple modes or displacement of increments defined in multiple
continuation lines.
3.An imperfection input file can be an MSC Nastran HDF5 result file, a Nastran op2 file or a text based
file called IMPF. To use it, an ASSIGN HDF5IN, INPUTT2 or IMPFIN FMS command is
required.
4.The imperfection input file of HDF5 or op2 can be a result file of SOL 101, 103, 105 or a SOL 400
with ANALYSIS type of BUCK, MODES, STATIC, NLSTATIC or NLTRAN, and must contain
eigenvectors or displacement results.
5.IMPF file format is described in remark 12. It can be DISP format or GEOM format. If an IMPF file
is used in an IMPGEOM entry, only one continuation line of IMPGEOM is allowed, and
SUBCASEi, STEPi and MODEINCi are ignored. If format is GEOM, SCALE and SCALEi are
ignored too.
6.SUBCASEi must be specified if the imperfection input file is an op2 or hdf5 file.
7.STEPi is ignored when the imperfection input file is a result of SOL 101, 103 or 105. It must be
specified for a SOL 400 result file.
8.MODEINCi is ignored when the file is a result of SOL 101 or a linear static step of SOL 400. It is
required for other cases if the imperfection file is an hdf5 or op2 file.
9.UNITi must be specified if UNIT is 0 or not specified.
10. Geometric imperfection is applied to residual structure for superelement models. In the case of part
superelement, it is advised to adjust boundary grid point searching tolerance due to geometry
changing. This can be done by adding or modifying SEBULK or SECONCT entries.
11. MODID and MODIDi are only used when modules are present. -1 means the whole model, 0 or a
positive number is a module identification number.
12. Format of IMPF file
The IMPF file is a csv-like file, delimiters of a line can be spaces, a comma or a tab space. A line
starting with a “$” or “#” is a comment line. If the first line is a comment line and contains string
“GEOM” or “GRID”, then it is a GEOM file, i.e., the grid coordinates provided here will replace the
grid coordinates in the FE model; otherwise it is a DISP file, i.e., the displacements provided in the
file will be superimposed to the coordinates of the corresponding grids.
For each line, the first column is grid point id, followed by x,y and z. For DISP format, x,y and z are
coordinate variations from the original coordinates, and coordinate system is MSC Nastran global
system, this means that x,y,z are in the coordinate system indicated by CD field of GRID entries in
the original input file. For GEOM format, x,y and z are “imperfect” coordinates of the grid points,
coordinate system is MSC Nastran input system, this means the values of x,y,z respect CP field of the
GRID entries in the original input file.&lt;/p&gt;

When modules are present, BEGIN MODULE=modid and ENDMODULE can be used to specify
module id for a section of grids.

Airbag Cold Gas Inflator Model
Main Index
4.The cold gas inflator is a reservoir filled with high pressure gas. It is assumed that the volume stays
constant at TANKVOL. The mass inside the inflator will steadily decrease due to flow into the Euler
domain or to a GBAG. Due to inertia it can happen that the pressure of the inflator becomes less that
the outside pressure. In that case some inflow into the inflator occurs. Transport between inflator and
the Euler domain or GBAG is based on the constancy of total temperature. This is equivalent to the
pressure method.
5.If this field contains a real entry real or is left blank, the inflator gas constants are given on the
INFLTR entry itself. Otherwise, the entry will be read as the name of an INFLGAS entry. In this
case, the remaining entries must be left blank.

Tables used by an NLBSH3D to find force as function of displacement, velocity and rotor speed
Main Index
Remarks:
1.Values for the nonlinear forces will be determined using interpolation based on rotor speed and
relative deflection/velocity of grid pair. If the rotor speed is beyond the range specified by
MIN_FREQ and MAX_FREQ, a FATAL message will be produced. (Extrapolation will NOT be
used beyond this range).
2.At selected rotor speeds (Xi), force vs displacement (for LID-1) or force vs velocity (for LID-2) tables
(TIDi) are defined on TABLED1 entries.
3.For an arbitrary rotor speed n, linear interpolation is used to determine the force fxn to be applied for
the displacement/velocity. The illustration shows a graphic representation of interpolation for force
vs displacement between tables defined for rotor speeds X1 and X2.
4.For SYNC analysis, rotor speed is obtained from NLFREQ / NLFREQ1 bulk data card. For ASYNC
analysis, rotor speed is obtained from RGYRO bulk data card.
5.All the tables (TABLED5 Pij) should provide lookup tables (TABLED1) for the range of rotor speeds
between Min_FREQ and  Max_Freq.ASYM Asymmetric, all terms are needed
MIN_FREQ Minimum valid rotor speed for all the table lookups provided. (Real). See remark 4.
MAX_FREQ Max valid rotor speed for all the table lookups provided. (Real &amp;gt; 0.0 Required). Refer

= 1.0 will open up the complete area of the hole, while a value of
COEFFV = 0.0 will result in a closed hole. The characteristics for the
flow are defined on a PORHOLE entry, with ID as defined on the
PORTYPID.
PERMEAB The PERMEAB logic is used to model permeable air-bag material. The
permeable area can be defined for a BSURF or for the entire coupling
surface. The velocity of the gas flow through the (sub) surface is
defined as a linear or tabular function of the pressure difference
between the gas inside the air bag and the environmental pressure. The
function is specified on a PERMEAB entry, with ID as defined on the
PORYPID. The area actually used for outflow is the subsurface area
multiplied by the value of COEFFV
PORFGBG The PORFGBG logic can be used to model gas flow through a hole in
the coupling surface connected to a GBAG. A BSURF defines the hole.
The open area of the hole is equal to the area of the surface multiplied
by COEFFV. A value of COEFFV = 1.0 will open up the complete area
of the hole, while a value of COEFFV = 0.0 will result in a closed hole.
The characteristics for the flow are defined on a PORFGBG entry,
with ID as defined on the PORTYPID.
PERMGBG The PERMGBG logic is used to model gas flow through a permeable
area in the coupling surface connected to a GBAG. The permeable area
can be defined for a BSURF or for the entire coupling surface. The
velocity of the gas flow through the (sub) surface is defined as a linear
or tabular function of the pressure difference. This function is specified
on a PERMGBG entry, with ID as defined on the PORYPID. The area
actually used for outflow is the subsurface area multiplied by the value
of COEFFV.
PORFCPL The PORFCPL logic can be used to model gas flow through a hole in
the coupling surface connected to another coupling surface. A BSURF
defines the hole. The open area of the hole is equal to the area of the
(sub) surface multiplied by COEFFV. A value of COEFFV = 1.0 will
open up the complete area of the hole, while a value of COEFFV = 0.0
will result in a closed hole. The characteristics for the flow are defined
on a PORFCPL entry, with ID as defined on the PORTYPID.

Remarks:
1.The combination of multiple LEAKAGEs with different PORTYPEs is allowed.
2.It allows for setting up the exact same model for either a uniform pressure model (GBAG to

&lt;p&gt;LSEQ
Static Load Set Definition1984
Main Index
Defines a sequence of static load sets.
Format:
Example:
Remarks:
1.LSEQ will not be used unless selected in the Case Control Section with the LOADSET command.
2.The number of static load vectors created for each superelement depends upon the type of analysis.
In static analysis, the number of vectors created is equal to the number of unique EXCITEIDs on all
LSEQ entries in the Bulk Data; in dynamic analysis, the number of vectors created is equal to the
number of unique EXCITEIDs on all RLOAD1, RLOAD2, TLOAD1, TLOAD2 and ACSRCE
entries in the Bulk Data.
3.EXCITEID may be referenced by CLOAD, RLOAD1, RLOAD2, TLOAD1, and TLOAD2 entries
in order to apply the static load in nonlinear, static and dynamic analysis.
4.Element data recovery for thermal loads is not currently implemented in dynamics.
5.The SID-EXCITEID number pair must be unique with respect to similar pairs on all other LSEQ
entries in the Bulk Data.
6.In a nonsuperelement analysis, LID and TID cannot both be blank.  In superelement analysis, they
may both be blank as long as static loads are prescribed in the upstream superelements.
7.It is no longer necessary to employ LOADSET/LSEQ data to specify static loading data for use in
dynamic analysis. In the absence of LSEQ Bulk Data entries, all static loads whose load set IDs match
the EXCITEIDs on all RLOAD1, RLOAD2, TLOAD1, TLOAD2 and ACSRCE entries in the Bulk

•If only one E, G, or NU is blank, then it will be computed from the equation:&lt;br&gt;
.  If this is not desired, then the MAT2 entry is recommended.  If E, G,
or NU are made temperature dependent by the MATT1 entry, then the equation is applied to the
initial values only. Caution: Inconsistent E and G can result in NU &amp;gt;.5 which for three
dimensional elasticity results in negative stress for positive strain. This can cause large max ratios.
3.If values are specified for all of the properties E, G, and NU, then it is recommended that the
following relationship be satisfied:
If this relationship is not desired, then the MAT2 entry is recommended.
It should also be noted that some of the properties are not applied in the stiffness formulation of
certain elements as indicated in Table 18. Therefore, it is recommended that only the applicable
properties be specified for a given element.
4.MAT1 materials may be made temperature -dependent by use of the MATT1 entry.  In SOL 106,
linear and nonlinear elastic material properties in the residual structure will be updated as prescribed
under the TEMPERATURE Case Control command.
5.The mass density RHO will be used to compute mass for all structural elements automatically.
6.Weight density may be used in field 6 if the value 1/g is entered on the PARAM,WTMASS entry,
where g is the acceleration of gravity (see Parameters ).

4.The convention for the Gij in fields 3 through 8 are represented by the matrix relationship
The G matrix, including G13 and G23 is an extension to conventional orthotropic plans stress behavior that
allows membrane-shear coupling. If the MAT2 is used for plane stress elements or referenced as MID1 or
MID2 in a PSHELL, the G matrix must be invertible and positive definite.
5.When MAT2 is referenced as a MID3 in a PSHELL, then it is used as:
This may lead to user warning message 6134 which may be ignored. See The NASTRAN Theoretical
Manual , Section 4.2.
6.When MAT2 is referenced as a MID4 in a PSHELL, then only G13 and G23 are required. One will
observe a user warning message 9994, The Material Property Matrix is not positive
definite  which may be ignored.
7.MCSID must be nonzero if PARAM,CURV is specified to extrapolate element centroid stresses or
strains to grid points on plate and shell elements only.  CQUAD4 element corner stresses are not
supported by PARAM,CURV.
8.To obtain the damping coefficient GE, multiply the critical damping ratio  by 2.0.
9.Unlike the MAT1 entry, data from the MAT2 entry is used directly without adjustment of equivalent
E, G, or NU values.
10. TREF and GE are ignored if this entry is referenced by a PCOMP/PCOMPG entry.
11. TREF is used in two different ways (See Remarks 6. and 7. of TEMPERATURE Case Control entry

•Except for SOL106 and SOL400 nonlinear analysis, TREF is used as the reference temperature

13. PCOMP/PCOMPG entries generate MAT2 entries starting from 10 0,000,001 onwards. Explicitly
specified MAT2 IDs must not conflict with internally generated MAT2 IDs. Furthermore, the A1,
A2 and A3 fields of MAT2 generated by Nastran from PCOMP that&amp;rsquo;s used for PSHELL&amp;rsquo;s MID4 has
a special format.  They are [G4]×[ 4] and not [4]. These generated MAT2 entries have MID greater
than 10 0,000,000. User supplied MAT2 should avoid using MID greater than 1 00,000,000 if it&amp;rsquo;s
used for MID4 of a PSHELL entry. I f MIDs larger than 99999999 are used, PARAM,NOCOMPS,-
1 must be specified to obtain stress output.
14. In nonlinear static analysis (SOL 106) the QUAD4, TRIA3, QUADR, and TRIAR thermal loads are
computed using the secant (default) method. To use the more accurate integral method, specify
‘PARAM,EPSILONT,INTEGRAL’ in bulk data. See Parameters .
15. Negative values for ST, SC, and SS lead to no margins of safety being computed.
16. If the MAT2 is referenced by the PCOMP/PCOMPG entry, the transverse shear flexibility for the
referenced lamina is zero.
17. Defines structural damping matrix data for advanced composites. If the GEij values are present, then
Nastran will ignore the GE value given on the first continuation entry field (6) and the GE entry given
in field (8) of the PCOMP/PCOMPG entry and use the given GEij values. The rationale  of these
entries is that with composite materials made of a viscoelastic resin system, the damping matrix does
not scale with the stiffness matrix. For example, in the directions where you have more fibers, the
stiffness is higher because you have more fibers but the damping coefficient is smaller because you
have less resin matrix which is the main source of damping. To use this feature in composites, the
PCOMP/PCOMPG MIDi entries must refer to MAT2 entries.
For any ply that does not point to a MAT2 with extended GEij, the GE value will be taken from the
GE field of the corresponding MATi entry (MAT1 field 9, MAT2 field 6 of first continuation,
MAT8 field 2 of second continuation.).
The damping when extended GEij is in effect is applied in element material routines by forming the
product GEij * Gij when forming the K4 damping matrix. For any ply not using an extended GEij
of MAT2 the product GE*Gij is used.&lt;/p&gt;

Remarks:
1.The material number must refer to a MAT8 material definition.
2.If a failure theory is selected other than COMBINAT, the theory defines the following failure modes:
For an element to fail completely, both fiber and matrix in all sublayers must fail.
3.This material model can only be referenced from a PCOMP entry.
4.Failure stresses are required if a failure theory is selected.
5.ALPHA is used for all failure theories to define a nonlinear stress-strain relation.
6.The individual failure modes are defined according to the corresponding mode in the theory as listed
under FT. To be relevant, the theory must define the failure mode (see Remark 2.). You must enter
data if FT is set to COMBINAT.

Orthotropic Failure Material Properties - SOL7002010
Main Index
To override the default model, an integer value is defined as a packed word in the following order:
The last five fields of the MAT8A Bulk Data entry are input for the user to specify the degradation
behavior for each mode of failure.
8.The PFD entry indicates how the stresses are degraded to zero. The PFDST indicates when the
stresses start to degrade.
Using ALL means that degradation starts when all material constants (E1, E2, V12, G12) are
degraded to zero as specified by the FT entry and the property degradation rules. Note that property
degradation means that the stress increments are zero but that the stresses degrade according to PFD.
INDV means that stress degradation starts for the fiber stress if E1=0.0, for matrix stress if E2=0.0,
and for shear stress if G12=0.0.
9.Any failure theory introduces five additional sublayer variables. The PFDST entry introduces three
additional variables. The number of user variables is defined by NV.1 Denotes property degradation.
0 Denotes no degradation.&lt;/p&gt;

9.Defines structural damping matrix data for advanced composites. If the GEij values are present, the
Nastran will ignore the GE value given on the third c ontinuation entry field (8) and use the given
GEij values. The rationale o f these entries is that with composite materials made of a viscoelastic resin
system, the damping matrix does not scale with the stiffness matrix. For example, in the directions
where you have more fibers, the stiffness is higher because you have more fibers but the damping
coefficient is smaller because you have less resin matrix which is the main source of damping. To use
this feature in composites, the PCOMPLS MIDi entries must refer to MAT9 entries. x

b.If the MAT10 entry is referenced in a PSOLID entry where PFLUID option is selected, the value
defined for ALPHA has no special meaning but it is only the normalized admittance coefficient
calculated by the user at the most appropriate excitation frequency (defined in order to have good
results in the frequency range of interest).
9.For Poro-Elastic Material, PEM, user is expected to provide adiabatic BULK modulus for fluid-phase
of PEM which is equal to GAMMA, fluid ratio of specific heats (see MATPE1 for detailed), times
isothermal BULK modulus. Isothermal BULK modulus is BULK modulus at constant temperature
for fluid itself.
10. When used in conjunction with PSLDN1, only pyramid elements can be associated with the MAT10
fluid property. CHEXA, CPENTA, CTETRA elements using MAT10 are not supported with
PSLDN1.
11. The terms of the fluid mass matrix are not multiplied by the value of PARAM and WTMASS.&lt;/p&gt;

Fluid Frequency Dependence2018
Main Index
Specifies frequency-dependent material properties on MAT10 entry fields via TABLEDi entries.
Format:
Example:
Remarks:
1.Fields 3, 4, etc., of this entry correspond, field-by-field, to fields 3, 4, etc., of the MAT10 entry
referenced in field 2. The value in a particular field of the MAT10 entry is replaced by the table
referenced in the corresponding field of this entry. Blank or zero entries mean that there is no
frequency dependence of the fields on the MAT10 entry.  The nominal value of GE defined on
MAT10 needs to be non-zero to get frequency dependent damping defined in the GE table on
MAT10F.
2.Table references must be present for each item that is frequency dependent.
3.When ALPHA on MAT10 is specified it is multiplied by the excitation frequency in radians/unit
time. If F(ALPHA) is specified then the value supplied by F(ALPHA) will take precedence and
ALPHA WILL NOT BE MULTIPLIED by the excitation frequency.MAT10F Fluid Frequency Dependence

If FORM = PERFECT,  is the yield stress and  and FID should be blank. This is known as
elastic-perfectly plastic behavior. If temperature-dependent yield is present. then FORM = TABLE
should be used and the temperature-dependent yield entered through TABL3D.
3.For temperature-dependent materials, one can either define the temperature variation through the
TABL3D option or include the MATTEP option. The first procedure is recommended.
4.In a large displacement analysis (LGDISP = 1, 2, 11, 12), the Cauchy stress and logarithmic strain are
used.
5.The plastic deformation starts when the effective stress  exceeds the yield stress.
The yield stress is initially defined by the initial yield point, which is subsequently modified by the
hardening rule to account for strain hardening. Under the isotropic hardening rule, the size of the
yield surface expands as a function of effective plastic strain . Under the kinematic hardening
rule, the center of the yield surface moves in stress space while keeping the same size and shape. 001p12p2H3

Ziegler’s law is used to define the translation of the yield surface. Under the combined hardening, the
initial hardening is assumed to be entirely isotropic, but the elastic range attains a constant value (i.e.,
behaving like kinematic hardening) after some plastic straining. The effective stress for von Mises is
expressed as

7.Hill’s anisotropic model introduces orthotropic plastic material. The plastic anisotropy proposed by
Hill introduces six parameters to the von Mises yield function, from which an effective stress may be
derived as

respectively; , , and  are the shear yield stresses in pure shear; and  is the reference
yield stress which should be an average yield stress in all dir ections.
In practical applications, however, the initial yield stress cannot be measured in all directions. The
plastic anisotropy is pronounced in the sheet metal due to prior rolling process, for which the plastic
anisotropy is customarily characterized by r-values defined by strain ratio measured in the uniaxial

throughout the deformation, F, G, H and N can be determined by r-values from tensile specimen cut
at 0, 45 and 90 degrees to the rolling direction:
The orthotropic plasticity parameters should be calculated from the r-values and the initial yield stress
either in 0 or 90 degree direction (  or ) from the experiment. The yield stress in the thickness

a.For explicit creep, supported yield criteria include RYIELD = VMISES, HILL, BARLAT,
LINMOHR and PBLMOHR. All conventional data defined through fields like Y0, WKHARD,
etc. are used to define the plasticity properties. Note that in this case, the plasticity is treated
implicitly whereas the creep is treated explicitly.
b.For implicit creep, plasticity properties are defined through special options of the MATEP card -
RYIELD field has to be set to IMPCREEP field and the actual yield stress has to be set on the
VMISES field under the IMPCREEP option. In this case, both creep and plasticity are treated
implicitly. Note - in this case, only Von Mises yield criterion is satisfied. The creep happens
immediately whereas the plasticity happens only after the equivalent stress exceeds the VMISES
value.&lt;/p&gt;

2.A piecewise linear, stress-strain characteristic is used by specifying FID and TYPE (beams and shells
only)
The stress-strain characteristic used internally in Nastran SOL700 is in terms of true stress and
equivalent plastic strain. However, for convenience, the stress-strain characteristic can be input in
any of the following ways:
3.With solid elements, only an elastic perfectly plastic yield model is currently used. Only the Y0 field
is used.
4.If FID is blank or zero, a bilinear stress-strain curve is assumed. If FID has a value, it refers to a
TABLED1 entry giving the stress-strain curve for the material.
5.If FID is defined, the value of YIELD is left blank, since it is determined from the stress-strain curve.
6.If RTID is blank or zero and C and P are blank or zero, the yield stress does not vary with strain rate.
If RTID has a value, then it references a TABLED1 entry, which gives the variation of the scale factor
applied to the yield stress with strain rate. (C and P must be blank or zero.)= yield stress specified in the Y0 field

If RTID is blank or zero and C and P are defined, the enhancement of the yield stress with strain rate
is calculated as&lt;br&gt;
where ?d is the dynamic stress, ?y is the static yield stress, and is the equivalent plastic strain rate.
7.If TYPE is PLAST or PMOD, Young’s modulus must be defined. If TYPE is ENG or TRUE and
Young’s modulus is defined, it overrides the value calculated from the stress-strain curve.
8.Note that for values exceeding the maximum x-value of either of the TABLED1 entries (see FID and
RTID  fields), linear extrapolation is used based upon the last two points specified in the TABLED1.

15. If the initial Poisson’s ratios in MATORT are not supplied, the default is set to zero. Therefore, the
behavior of the material during compaction is uncoupled. This means that straining in the (local) x-
direction produces stresses only in the (local) x-direction, and not in the (local) y- or z-direction. The
tables define the variation of the stress in a particular direction with the relative volume or the crush.
The relative volume is defined as (current volume)/(initial volume) and varies from 1.0
(uncompressed) to 0.0 (zero volume). Crush is defined as one minus the relative volume and varies
from 0.0 to 1.0. Since the tables should be defined with increasing x-values, it is convenient to use
the default value for type, which is CRUSH. When defining the curves, care should be taken that the
extrapolated values do not lead to negative yield stresses.
16. The elastic moduli (and the initial Poisson’s ratios only if they are supplied) in MATORT vary
linearly with the relative volume from their initial uncompacted values to the fully compacted ones.
17. When the material is fully compacted, its behavior becomes isotropic with an elastic perfectly plastic
material characteristic.
18. If the TIDSR option is used, you can supply a table including strain-rate effects. Strain rate is defined
here as the Euclidean norm of the deviatoric strain-rate tensor; i.e.,
The y values in this table are factors with which the stresses in the other tables are multiplied to
incorporate strain-rate effects.= effective plastic strain

19. The pressure-volume characteristic can either be defined in terms of the amount of crush, which is
minus the engineering strain and is defined as , with  as the relative volume; or in terms of the
volumetric (true) strain which is defined as:   or
The crush factor must be between 0 and 1. The volumetric strain must always be negative.
20. If the field for the value of CUTOFF is left blank, then this value is calculated from the yield function
defined by the constants A0, A1, and A2. In case of a Mohr-Coulomb yield model, the cut-off
pressure is calculated as the root of the pressure-yield stress curve. If the YIELD=1.0 is used, the cut-
off pressure is calculated as the intersection point of the yield surface with the hydrostat (if only A0 is
nonzero, then the cut-off pressure is set to -100K, where K is the bulk modulus). The cut-off pressure
must be negative.
21. Either a minimum pressure (CUTOFF=3.0) or a failure pressure (CUTOFF=1.0 or 2.0) can be
specified. In the first case, this corresponds to a tensile cutoff, where the pressure cannot fall below
the minimum value. In the second case, if the pressure falls below the failure pressure the element fails
and cannot carry tensile loading for the remainder of the analysis. Thus, the pressure can never
become negative again. If CUTOFF=1.0 is used, the elements can physically fail, which means that
the stresses are set to zero, but also the failure flag is used as in normal MATF models. If
CUTOFF=2.0 is used, only the stresses are set to zero.
22. If YIELD=1.0 is used, the yield stress is determined by a Mohr-Coulomb
model:
If YIELD=2.0 is used, the yield surface in three-dimensional space is defined by s=0 here&lt;br&gt;
where sij are the deviatoric stresses and J2 is the second invariant of the stress deviation. The
coefficients B0, B1 and B2 can be related to the coefficients A0, A1 and A2. The relation between the
coefficients depends on the YSTYP field as shown below.
If YSTYP=2.0, then
B0=A0
B1=A1
B2=A2

Specifies failure model properties for linear elastic materials to be used for static, quasi static or transient
dynamic analysis. Up to three criteria may be specified for each material. For progressive failure (ITYPE=2)
only the first criterion will contribute to failure. The other two, if specified, will only provide output of failure
index. SOL 400 (only with extended property entries), and all linear solution sequences between SOL101

Remarks:
1.The MATF Bulk Data entry contains supplementary data for failure index calculation and failure
prediction of the elastic materials with the same MID. If this capability is used in nonlinear analysis,
MATF can activate a progressive failure process.
2.Progressive failure behavior for various materials can be simulated using the MATF Bulk Data entry.
Failure occurs when any one of the specified failure criterion is satisfied; that is, the calculated failure
index exceeds 1.0. Upon failure, the elastic moduli are reduced. This is done differently depending
on failure criterion. The behavior up to the failure point is linear elastic. After failure the behavior is
still elastic but with a different stiffness. The option should not be combined with other material
nonlinearities like plasticity.
3.According to the Maximum Stress Criterion, six failure indices  are calculated as follows:Criterion=7 (Hashin)  A4 is the factor for E3 reduction due to fiber failure.  It takes values
between 0.0 and 1.0 and defaults to 0.0 where E3 is reduced in the same way as E1.  A
value of 1.0 leads to an E3 reduction due to E2 only.  Values between 0.0 and 1.0 lead to
a mixture of degradation from matrix and fiber failure.

Criterion=7 (Hashin)  A5 is the factor for G12 reduction from fiber failure and takes

of 1.0 leads to G12 reduction due to only fiber failure.  Values between 0.0 and 1.0 lead
to a mixture of degradation from matrix and fiber failure.

10. A MATTF entry with the same MID as MATF may be used to specify the temperature variation of
the failure criterion values.
11. User subroutine UFAIL is used along with option MATUDS.
12. In SOL 400, MATF is only supported for elements with property extensions. This implies that for
such elements, PBAR / PBARL, PBEAM / PBEAML, PCOMP / PCOMPG, PROD, PSHEAR,
PSHELL, PLPLANE and PSOLID should be associated with PBARN1, PBEMN1, PSHLN1,
PRODN1, PSHEARN, PSHLN1, PSHLN2 and PSLDN1 respectively. Note that, prior to MD
Nastran 2010, if the property extensions were missing, then the MATF data was not considered in
the element&amp;rsquo;s formulation. If the property extensions are missing, they are automatically added with
default settings by the program unless the user has set NLMOPTS,SPROPMAP,-1 in the bulk data.
For non-composite material with MATF, only the first failure criteria is calculated and its failure
index is outputted in NLOUT.
13. For the primary format, if only one criterion is needed and no data is required on the 3rd line, it can
be omitted. If more than one criterion is needed, all 3 lines are required except for the last one. If the
third line of the last one is not required, it may be omitted.
14. Stress limits such as ST, SC, SS, , , ,  in the MAT1, MAT2 and MAT8 entries are not
used in SOL 400.
15. Stress and/or strain allowables in all directions should be defined if the default is not appropriate. Be
sure not to set some of these values to low numbers.
16. If MAT8 with Hashin is used in SOL 400 run with PSLDN1 then Hashin FT will be ignored with
an appropriate warning message to include MATF instead .XtXcYtYc&lt;/p&gt;

Remarks:
1.Defines the properties of a failure model where failure is determined by a damage model. The damage
model is given by:
The summation is performed over all past time increments. The variable D measures the damage; T
is the temperature,  is the mean stress, is the von Mises equivalent stress, and  is the
fracture strain.
The fracture strain depends on a nondimensional plastic strain rate, . If D exceeds one it set
equal to one.
There are two methods to determine when elements fail:
•Continuous failure: The yield stress is reduced by a factor (1-D). When D exceeds 1 the yield
stress equals zero and the element fails.
•Discrete failure: the element fails when D equals one.
This failure model applies to high-strain rate deformation of metals. It is less suitable for quasi-static
problems.
2.For a physically meaningful model, the value of the failure envelope exponential coefficient should be
less than the failure envelope parameter (ALPHA &amp;lt; GAMMA).
3.The tension cut off value (TOFF) can be defined on the entry and must be less than zero. If the
tension cut off is left blank, Nastran SOL700 calculates the tension cut off as the intersection point
of the failure envelope surface with the J1-axis as described in Remark 4.FULL Fully iterative

surface (k=2), and the fixed tension cutoff surface (k=3). The yield conditions are defined by:&lt;br&gt;
The hardening parameter, , for the cap model is related to the plastic volume change by a hardening
law.
The cap model is a plasticity model described by a yield surface that is defined by means of a failure
envelope, a hardening cap and a tension cut off. Figure 1 shows the typical yield surfaces in a cap

Main Index
Kinematic work hardening for the failure envelope surface is based on the approach of Isenberg et.
Al. [1978]. It is switched on by specifying N. The failure envelope surface is replaced by a family of
envelope surfaces that are bounded by an initial yield surface and by a limiting failure envelope
surface. Which member of the family is taken, is implemented by replacing in all yield relations the
stress tensor  by  where  is a deviatoric tensor that accumulates in time. This tensor  is called
the “back stress tensor” and is defined by
Here  is the deviatoric plastic strain tensor, N denotes the size of the yield surface and represents
the radial distance between the outside of the initial yield surface and the inside of the limit surface.
After each increment of , it is checked whether its second invariant exceeds N. In that case,  is
scaled by a scalar such that its second invariant equals N. For consistency between the limit surface of
the kinematic hardening cap model and the failure envelope of the standard cap model, the parameter
is placed by -N.

When PERC = 100%, and the coating of this fabric model is used to simulate an isotropic air bag
material, it is best to scale down the compressive stresses of the coating. A suggested value is
COMPCOAT = 0.1
4.Since this is a model which tracks warp and weft directions and uses total warp/weft strain as a state
variable, the initial warp and weft directions must be specified. There are two ways to indicate the
initial warp and weft directions:
a.THETA1 and THETA2
Orientation angles between the element coordinate system and the warp/weft ends. If no
orientation angle is specified, vectors will be used to indicate the warp/weft directions of the fabric
material with respect to the basic coordinate system.
b.XWARP, YWARP, ZWARP and XWEFT, YWEFT, ZWEFT
Vectors indicating the warp/weft directions of the fabric material with respect to the basic
coordinate system. The projection of these vectors on the surface of each element is used to
determine the angle between the element and the material coordinate system. If the orientation
angles are defined, these vectors are ignored.
5.For shell element properties (PSHELL1), when the material is MATFAB, the material angle THETA
is ignored. The orientation of the fabric fibers is defined completely on the MATFAB entry.
For layered composite element properties (PCOMP), when the material of a ply is MATFAB, the
angle THETAi is ignored. The orientation of the fabric fibers is defined completely on the MATFAB
entry.
6.The maximum shear stress is given by a friction coefficient of the fabric (SCOF) times the RMS value
of the direct fiber stresses.
7.If the field G12 is left blank, the shear modulus is computed from the RMS value of the two linear
stiffness coefficients.
8.When MATFAB material is referenced by shell elements, the Spin Rate method (SPIN) is applied
automatically when no stress-rotation correction is specified on SPINCOR option. See PSHELL1
entry for the details on SPINCOR option.
9.There are a number of specific output sublayer variables useful for this material:
Q1AF Direction cosines/sines between the element coordinate
Q2AFIB System and the warp ends
Q1BFIB Direction cosines/sines between the element coordinate
Q2BFIB System and the weft picks
SGMA Direct stress in fabric parallel to the warp ends
SGMB Direct stress in fabric parallel to the weft picks
SGFRIC Stress due only to shear in the weave of the fabric
EPSFA Strain in fabric parallel to the warp ends
EPSFB Strain in fabric parallel to the weft picks
ANGLE Crossover angle between warp ends and weft picks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MATF AB
Woven Fabric Material- SOL7002078

10. When a fabric is being sheared, the angle between the fibers changes. At a certain moment, the fibers
will reach a locking angle, after which a further change in the fiber angle is no longer possible.
The simulation models this behavior as follows:
a.Change in Fiber Crossover Angle &amp;lt; LockAng1
The shear stress between the fibers is cut off based on the friction coefficient SCOF
b.LockAng1 &amp;lt; Change in Fiber Crossover Angle &amp;lt; LockAng2
The shear stress between the fibers is linearly increased.
c.Change in Fiber Crossover Angle &amp;gt; LockAng2
The shear stress between the fibers is no longer cut off.
This situation is equal to an infinite friction coefficient SCOF.&lt;/p&gt;

Remarks:
1.Element properties must reference MAT1 entries in order to be linked to a MATFTG entry as only
metal fatigue analysis of isotropic materials is supported. The MID must match that of an existing
MAT1 entry called out by the property entry (e.g. PSHELL) unless the “MATID” line is provided,
in which case all the MIDi referenced on the “MATID” line are then linked to the MATFTG entry.
When the “MATID” line is used, E (required) and NU (optional) must be provided on this line as
the code has no way of knowing from which referenced MAT1 this data should be extracted. Young’s
Modulus (E) and elastic Poisson’s ratio (NU) are extracted from the corresponding MAT1 entry of
the same ID when no “MATID” line is present. Usage of E and NU in the fatigue analysis itself is
dependent on the type of fatigue analysis requested and fatigue material properties provided. Young&amp;rsquo;s
Modulus (E) is mainly used for deriving S-N or e-N data when none is provided. If the “MATID”
line is used, and a MAT1 of the same ID also exists, that MAT1 ID must be in the MIDi list or it
will be ignored in the analysis. In other words, when the “MATID” line is used, only the supplied
MIDi IDs are used in the fatigue analysis.K’ Cyclic strength coefficient, (Valid range equivalent in MPa: 50 ≤ Real ≤ 1.2e4);

2.The CNVRT field is only used if fatigue material stress based parameters are directly input using the
&amp;ldquo;STATIC,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;SN,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;EN,&amp;rdquo;  or &amp;ldquo;TABLE,&amp;rdquo; methods.  It is used to allow the user to input the fatigue
material stress related parameters, (YS, UTS, SRI1, VALUEi, TIDi, A, B, Eb, K) in different units
other than the model&amp;rsquo;s consistent units.  Example:  model is producing stresses in PSI units, fatigue
material parameters input in MPa, the CNVRT factor should be 145.0377 to convert MPa to PSI.
Note that the y-values of any referenced TABLEM1 entries are also converted for the S-N method or
both the x- and y-values when TYPE=LIFE (Haigh curves). It is also necessary to use the DTI,UNITS
for defining the model&amp;rsquo;s stress units.   See DTI,UNITS. (Real; Default=1.0)
3.For SOLs 101, 103, and 112 , if only STATIC is supplied, then for standard S-N or -N analysis, the
S-N or -N curve is derived using the UTS and a material CODE. For fatigue analysis of spot or seam
welds, a standard material set is used based on CODE, and UTS can be set to any valid number as
the UTS from the standard material set will be used instead  (only ferrous  and aluminum codes are
valid for spot/seam welds).  Valid codes are listed in Table 9-23 below. At a minimum UTS must be
supplied along with the material CODE and E on MAT1, or an error will be issued. If either flag (SN
or EN) is present, then the automatic generation is suppressed if all the data necessary to define S-N
or -N curves are given. For SN, these fields are SRI1, b1, Nc1. For EN, these fields are Sf, b, c, Ef,
n’, K’. Either all of them are present, in which case they are used directly, or all of them are omitted,
in which case the parameters are derived as mentioned above. The determination as to whether S-N
or -N curves are generated is determined by the TYPE field set on the FTGPARM entry. If surface
finish corrections are to be applied, CODE is also required (see PFTG entry). When curves are
derived, the specified CODE gets internally converted to a generic code ferrous =99 for CODE&amp;lt;100,
aluminum =100 for 100  CODE  200, other=0 for 200  CODE  300, or titatnium =300 for 300
 CODE &amp;lt; 400. When SN or EN flags exist, the generic code is set to other , but the CODE is used
as given.
For SOLs 108, and 111 , if only STATIC is supplied, see Remark 5.
4.For SOLs 10 1, 103, and 1 12: TYPE can be set to MEAN (or AMEAN), RRATIO (or ARRATIO),
or LIFE (or ALIFE) for constant mean, R-ratio, or life (Haigh diagrams), respectively, when using the
“TABLE” flag. When using multiple S-N curves for mean stress correction, CORR=INTERP on
FTGPARM must be used. In this case, for RRATIO, a curve at R=-1 is required and for MEAN, a
curve at zero (0) mean is required. MEAN vs. AMEAN, or RRATIO vs. ARRATIO, or LIFE vs.
ALIFE indicates the stress type of the curves is range or amplitude, respectively.
For SOLs 108 and 111 : TYPE can be set to AMPL or RANGE to indicate that the S-N curve is
defined as amplitude or range and is applicable for the SN and TABLE lines.
5.For SOLs 101, 103, and 11 2: If an S-N analysis is specified (TYPE field on FTGPARM entry) but
no S-N curve is supplied, an error will be issued.  If an -N analysis is specified but no -N curve is
supplied, an error will be issued.  The STATIC data is required if SN or EN flags are specified on the
MATFTG entry. The SN  and TABLE flags are generally mutually exclusive. When both SN and
TABLE lines are defined, if TYPE is set, the SN parameters (SRI1, b1, Nc1, b2) will be ignored. EN
flag may be present with SN  or TABLE flags, but one or the other will be ignored based on the type
of analysis as set using the TYPE field on the FTGPARM entry. See Remark 7. and 8. for other
“SNS1/SNS2/SNBR1/SNBR2” definitions.
If MMPDS is used, the MMPDS mean stress correction is automatically applied by default
(CORR=MMPDS on FTGPARM entry).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2085 MATFTG
Fatigue Material Properties
Main Index
For SOLs 108 and 111 : The STATIC line is required and at least one of SN, TABLE, MMPDS, or
EN lines. If no SN, TABLE, MMPDS, or EN lines are present, then the fatigue analysis is skipped
and only the random vibration analysis is performed1. The use of the TYPE field in the FTGPARM
entry has limited affect. Please note: If only SN data is present, it is used by default. If only EN data
is present, it is used by default. The SN, TABLE, and MMPDS entries are mutually exclusive and if
more are present for any particular MID, then the following hierarchical rule is implement ed to
choose which to use: MMPDS, TABLE, SN. If both SN and EN are defined for a particular MID,
EN is selected by default unless TYPE on the FTGPARM is set, in which case the corresponding SN
or EN definition is used. However, TYPE is ignored if the corresponding material definition is not
present, and the material definition used is then based on the hierarchy just defined.
6.For SOLs 101, 103, and 11 2: Mean stress sensitivity: M1 for R&amp;gt;1; M2 for -  &amp;lt; R &amp;lt; 0; M3 for
0&amp;lt;R&amp;lt;0.5; M4 for 0.5&amp;lt;R&amp;lt;1. If M1-4 are undefined, and the material type (CODE) is given , all the
parameters will be estimated using empirically defined rules for the FKM mean stress correction
method. If only M2 is defined, then M1 and M4 will be set to zero and M3 to M2/3.
7.For SOLs 101, 103, and 11 2: The “SN” line is used for the definition of standard SN parameters for
any SN analysis. In the case of fatigue analysis of spot welds, “SNS1” and “SNS2” are used to define
the SN curves of the top and bottom sheets to which the spot weld is connected and “SN” is used to
define the SN curve of the weld nugget. If no “SN”, “SNS1”, or “SNS2” flags are present, generic SN
parameters are used for steel or aluminum per the material CODE supplied. See Table 9-24 for default
values used in this case.  If CODE is blank, steel is assumed. If only one of the flags is provided, then
“SN” = “SNS1” = “SNS2”. If “SNS1” or “SNS2” is missing but the other is present, then “SNS1” =
“SNS2”. If “SNS1” and “SNS2” are defined, but not “SN”, then “SN” = “SNS1”.
8.For SOLs 101, 103, and 11 2: The “SN” line is used for the definition of standard SN parameters for
any SN analysis. In the case of fatigue analysis of seam welds, “SNBR1” and “SNBR0” are used to
define the flexible (bending ratio=1.0) and stiff (bending ratio=0.0) SN curves. If no “SN”, “SNBR1”,
or “SNBR0” flags are present, generic SN parameters are used for steel or aluminum per the material
CODE supplied. See Table 9-24 for default values used in this case.  If CODE is blank, steel is assumed.
If only “SN” is supplied, then the “SN” parameters are used for both “SNBR1” and SNBR0”. If
“SNBR1” or “SNBR0” is missing but the other is present, then “SNBR1” = “SNBR0”. The 3rd and
4th lines of data for these keywords should not be entered as they are applicable to fatigue analysis of
spot welds only, and not for seam welds.
9.For SOLs 101, 103, and 11 2: If SF, DE, &amp;amp; TE values are not supplied, default values are used based
on material CODE for steel or aluminum. See Table 9-25 and Table 9-26. These should only be entered
for fatigue analysis of spot welds and not for anything else.
1If the EN line is supplied with only n’ and K’ defined, then the Neuber notch correction is also
applied in the random only analysis affecting the resultant output stress PSD.&lt;/p&gt;

Gasket Material Properties

Remarks:
1.MATG defines nonlinear properties in the thickness direction for compression only, designed for
gasket-like materials. MATG has anisotropy only in the thickness direction, which is called normal
anisotropy.
2.The MATG option can only be used with continuum composite elements, use PLCOMP.
3.The MATG entry defines the compressive behavior in thickness. The thickness direction is the
principal direction (3) in 3-dimensional solids and (2) for 2-dimensional solids (plane strain and
axisymmetric elements). Since MATG material allows only normal anisotropy, linear properties in
MAT1 are required for in-plane behavior.
4.The initial yield pressure should match a point in table TABLD.
5.The loading path for the gasket is always in compression. However, it starts from the origin to initial
yield pressure (nonlinear elastic range) and continues with strain hardening slope into the plastic
region. All the data points are specified in the first quadrant.
6.As many as 10 unloading paths may be defined in the thickness direction using TABLS1 in pressure
vs. gasket closure distance as in the loading path. All the unloading paths must start from zero pressure
and end at the loading path in the plastic region. Unloading behavior at undefined paths will be
interpolated between two adjacent unloading paths. The last point of the last specified unloading path
signifies full compression, which does not allow any further closure beyond the point.

statistical links of the material chain.
If the material test data are available from multiple experiments such as uniaxial and equi-biaxial tests,
the Ogden model is more accurate in fitting experimental results. If only uniaxial tension data is
available, the Arruda-Boyce model provides more accurate data fitting for multiple modes of
deformation.

16. The Ogden, Foam, Arruda-Boyce and Gent models are not available in SOLs 106 and 129.
17. In SOL 400, MATHE is only supported for nonlinear elements with property extensions. This
implies that for such elements, PBEAM / PBEAML, PCOMP / PCOMPG, PROD, PSHEAR,
PSHELL, PLPLANE and PSOLID should be associated with PBEMN1, PSHLN1, PRODN1,
PSHEARN, PSHLN1, PSHLN2 and PSLDN1 respectively.   Also, for incompressible rubber
models, linear 2D triangular elements specified on PSHLN2 and 3D tetrahedral elements specified
on PSLDN1 should be associated with an incompressible formulation (IPS for 2D plane strain, IAX
for 2D axisymmetric and ISOL for 3D tetrahedral.   Note that only PSOLID with PSLDN1 should
be used for 3D solid nonlinear elements and PLSOLID cannot be used for MATHE.   Note also that,
prior to MD Nastran 2010, if the property extensions were missing, then the analysis would stop with
an error. From MD Nastran 2010 onwards, if the property extensions are missing, they are
automatically added with appropriate settings by the program unless the user has set
NLMOPTS,SPROPMAP,-1 in the bulk data.

Remarks:
1.The Mooney-Rivlin constitutive behavior of this material is defined as a total stress/total strain
relationship. The nonlinear elastic material response is formulated by a strain-energy density function
for large strain components rather than by Hooke’s law.
The strain-energy density function is formulated according to the Mooney-Rivlin model and is
defined as&lt;br&gt;
The constants C and D are defined as:
where A, B and ? are input parameters.
I1, I2 and I3 are strain invariants in terms of stretches.
For a rubber-like material, the shear modulus G is much less than the bulk modulus K. As a result,
Poisson’s ratio is nearly equal to one half.
2.The constitutive behavior of this material is defined as a total stress/total strain relationship. The
nonlinear elastic material response is formulated by a strain-energy density function for large strain
components using Ogden function.
The strain-energy density function is formulated according to the Ogden model and is defined as&lt;br&gt;
The over bar (-) indicates that the volumetric effects have been eliminated from the principal
stretches.
3.Poisson’s ratio for FOAM1 model is effectively zero. Therefore, the shear and elastic moduli are
calculated from K, the bulk modulus.
4.For this model, the stress-strain curve is independent of the experimental test performed to obtain the
material data (uniaxial, shear, or volumetric). The most common test is the uniaxial compression test
where the stress-strain characteristic can either be defined in terms of the amount of crush, which is
minus the engineering strain, or in terms of the true strain. Since Poisson’s ratio is effectively zero, the
amount of crush is defined as , with  as the relative volume, and the true strain is
defined as   or
The crush factor must be between 0 and 1. The true strain must always be negative and the stress
positive (absolute value).WI1I2I3 AI13–BI23–C1

5.The yield surface in three-dimensional space is a sphere in principal stresses, and is defined by&lt;br&gt;
where the radius of the sphere, Rs, depends on the strains and strain rates as follows:&lt;br&gt;
with
and
and f1 is the function supplied in the stress-strain table and f2 (if defined) is the function supplied in
the factor-strain rate table.
6.A minimum (CUTOFF=2.0) or failure (CUTOFF=1.0) tensile stress can be defined. In the first case
this corresponds to a tensile cut-off where the stress cannot fall below the minimum value. In the
second case, if the stress falls below the failure stress the element fails and cannot carry tensile loading
for the remainder of the analysis. Thus the stress can never become negative again.
7.The unloading behavior is piecewise linear (UNLOAD=2.0), quadratic (UNLOAD=3.0) or
exponential (UNLOAD=1.0). The unloading curve is constructed such that the ratio of the dissipated
energy (area between compressive loading and unloading curve) to total energy (area under the
loading curve) is equal to the energy dissipation factor alpha. In the case of piecewise linear unloading,
Nastran SOL700 constructs an unloading curve whose segments are parallel to the supplied
compression table, except for the first and last segments, which pass respectively through the origin
and the point P on the compression curve where the unloading starts. In the case of quadratic
unloading, Nastran SOL700 constructs a quadratic curve starting in the origin and ending in point
P. If the quadratic unloading curve falls below the strain axis, then the unloading stress is set to zero.
In the case of exponential unloading, the unloading curve is constructed in a similarly to quadratic
unloading except for the shape of the curve, which is created from an exponential function instead of
a quadratic polynomial.
8.Not default values for taby, alpha, unload options are allowed only when cutoff is set to 1.0 or 2.0.112222332+ + Rs2=

any of the TABLES1 entries, supercedes the manual input of the parameters.
4.IF ND=1 and a nonzero value of D1 is provided or obtained from experimental data in TABD, then
the parameter estimation of the material constants Aij takes compressibility into account in the cases
of simple tension/compression, equibiaxial tension, and general biaxial deformation.  Otherwise, full
incompressibility is assumed in estimating the material constants.
5.See Chapters Hyperelastic Elements , Hyperelastic Material  and Hyperelastic Material  in the MSC Nastran
Reference Guide  for further details.
6.In SOL400, MATHP is supported for 2 sets of elements:
a.Incompressible conventional 2D (plane strain and axisymmetric) elements and 3D (continuum)
elements without property extensions. They are prescribed through PLPLANE and PLSOLID,
respectively. The original element formulations that are also available in SOL106 are used in these
cases.
b.Incompressible elements that are supported through property extensions.  For such elements,
PBAR / PBARL, PBEAM / PBEAML, PCOMP / PCOMPG, PROD, PSHEAR, PSHELL,
PLPLANE and PSOLID should be associated with PBARN1, PBEMN1, PSHLN1, PRODN1,
PSHEARN, PSHLN1, PSHLN2 and PSLDN1 respectively.
Also, for incompressible rubber models, 2D 3-node triangular elements and 3D 4-node
tetrahedral elements should be associated with an incompressible formulation by specifying IPS
for 2D plane strain and IAX for 2D axisymmetric elements in PSHLN2, as well ISOL for 3D
tetrahedral element in PSLDN1.
7.The material identification number must be unique for all MAT1, MAT2, MAT3, MAT8,
MATDIGI, MATG, MATHE, MATHP, MATNLE, MATORT, MATPE1, MATSMA,
MATUSR, MCOHE, MIXTURE, and MATD* entries.103A10A01 +  
Note:   1.PLSOLID is only used with the elements in (a) and only PSOLID with PSLDN1 can
be used for 3D solid nonlinear elements in (b).
2.Prior to MD Nastran 2010, if the property extensions were missing, the analysis would
stop with an error. From MD Nastran 2010 onwards, if the property extensions are
missing, they are automatically added with appropriate settings by the program unless
the user has set NLMOPTS,SPROPMAP,-1 in the bulk data.&lt;/p&gt;

3.It may be difficult to find all nine orthotropic constants. In some practical problems, the material
properties may be reduced to normal anisotropy in which the material is isotropic in a plane, e.g., in
plane 1-2 and has different properties in the direction normal to the plane 1-2. In the plane of
isotropy, the properties are reduced to

&lt;p&gt;There are five independent material constants for normal anisotropy (e.g., ).
In case the material has a planar anisotropy, in which the material is orthotropic only in a plane, the
elastic constants are reduced to seven, e.g., .

3.For a frequency-dependent skeleton material, MATF1 specifies the material properties at frequencies
on matching MAT1 fields.
4.Fluid dynamic viscosity, VISC, is temperature dependent. At 15° C (Celsius), its value is
1.82x10-6 N.s/m2 in the SI units.
5.GAMMA is defined as where  is the specific heat at constant pressure and the specific
heat at constant volume. Its default value is 1.402 for the air at ambient temperature.
6.PRANDTL number, Pr, is defined as where µ is the fluid dynamic viscosity (VISC) and
the thermal conductivity. For the dry air at ambient temperature, its value is around 0.7~0.8.
7.Porosity, , is defined as Vf/Vt where Vf is the volume of fluid and Vt is the total volume of the
poroelastic material. Hence, porosity is dimensionless.
8.Tortuosity measures the complexity of the path an air particle must follow to process from one point
to another point.  It is a dimensionless parameter.
9.Resistivity measures the resistance of poroelastic material against the flow of fluid. In SI unit, it is
measured in N.s/m4.
10. The density of poroelastic material is defined as   where  is the fluid
density from MAT10 and  is the solid density from MAT1.
11. The material identification number must be unique for all MAT1, MAT2, MAT3, MAT8,
MATDIGI, MATG, MATHE, MATHP, MATNLE, MATORT, MATPE1, MATSMA,
MATUSR, MCOHE, MIXTURE, and MATD* entries.
12. Assumptions for simplified BIOT porous material model are as follows:
13. MAT1 field should be left blank for POROPT=RIGID, MIKI or DELANY.
14. For POROPT=LUMPED, solid density can be provided either from MAT1 ID in MAT1 field or
directly from SRHO field of MATPE1 .
15. PEM/Nastran modeling with material MATPE1-MAT1-MAT10 encryption:
PEM now allows for encryption of data produced by Actran for the MATPE1 and associated MAT1
and MAT10 entries provided with Actran TRIM components.
Any TRIM component that contains encrypted data must contain the following:
BEGIN BULK TRMC=n ; containing the TRIM model exclusive of any explicit encrypted data. As an
example, let a primary trim model file have the name, say: pem_trim_cmpti.bdf.LUMPED the material skeleton can be assumed as extremely soft (E=0)

Main Index
It is required that the primary trim model pem_trim_cmpti.bdf  does not explicitly contain any
encrypted materials. It may contain, implicitly, encrypted data in the form of an MSC Nastran
include file as explained below.
The primary trim model pem_trim_cmpti.bdf  generally contains: Coupling sets from
ACPEMCP Bulk Data in main BULK, trim component FE sub-model grids and elements, and a
FREQi entry for Master (sampling) frequency range. For non-encrypted material data, it will also
contain the Poro-elastic material description. For encrypted material data, the Poro-elastic material
description requires special handling as described below.
For each TRIM component that contains encrypted data, there must be three associated files, for
example, for the above pem_trim_cmpti.bdf  the files: pem_trim_cmpti_mat.bdfs ,&lt;br&gt;
pem_trim_cmpti_mat.bdfe  and pem_trim_cmpti_mat.bdfk  named by the Actran
encryption component and are provided by the Actran encryption procedure. These three files are
required to have the extensions: .bdfs , .bdfe , and .bdfk
The required pem_trim_cmpti_mat.bdfs  file may be included in the primary&lt;br&gt;
pem_trim_cmpti.bdf  trim model with an MSC Nastran include pem_trim_cmpti_mat.bdfs&lt;br&gt;
or may be placed immediately after the primary pem_trim_cmpti.bdf  file with an MSC Nastran&lt;br&gt;
include pem_trim_cmpti_mat.bdfs  statement. If included after its primary file, it must not have
another file sandwiched between it and its primary file.
The include pem_trim_cmpti_mat.bdfs file contains data of the form:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2115 MATPE1
Isotropic Poroelastic Material Property definition
Main Index
The x.xx..0e+32 data is just scrambled data that allows MSC Nastran IFPSTAR component to check
the MATPE1, MAT1, and MAT10 data and also acts as a flag to Actran after the MSC Nastran run
that there is encrypted data for that component. The user should not modify this data.
The other two required files pem_trim_cmpti_mat.bdfe   and pem_trim_cmpti_mat.bdfk&lt;br&gt;
must not be in an include statement.
The three required pem_trim_cmpti_mat.bdfs/e/k  files must all be at the same location. The
MSC Nastran IFPSTAR application will automatically locate them based on the existence of the
pem_trim_cmpti_mat.bdfs  file. Note that, currently there is a limitation in the include file
address. If it is too long, say &amp;gt; 6 directories, the .bdfs/.bdfe/.bdfk may not be found.
Files with the extension .bdfe  contain the encrypted data. Files with the extension .bdfk  contain
the encrypted keys.
Resulting MSC Nastran OP2 META file:
For any MSC Nastran PEM run, MSC Nastran creates an OP2 file for Actran. For encrypted PEM
data, in the resulting OP2 file, MSC Nastran puts out for PEM, an MPT record containing the
MATPE1, MAT1, MAT10 in scrambled form.
A new TABLE META has been added to the OP2 output. For each BEGIN BULK TRIM=n that is
encrypted and has the required associated &amp;ldquo;bdfs&amp;rdquo;, a META table will be created that contains data of
the form:
For each encrypted TRIM component set of materials, there is a corresponding META data entry.
Record 1 of each META table contains the TRIM, BEGIN BULK and the associated ID.
Encrypted data validity and Machine Interface
The user of encryption files provided to MSC Nastran for the Actran TRIM component must
coordinate with the Actran encryption interface the CEID of the machines on which the encrypted
PEM runs are to execute.
At encryption time the following will occur:
a.At encryption time a data expiration date Month/Day/Year may be assigned.

2.If MASS is blank or zero, the mass will be calculated from the density and the geometry of the mesh
defining the rigid body.
3.The continuation lines are not required.
4.The MATRIG definition is used instead of a material definition and is referenced by properties
PSOLIDn, PSHELLn, PBAR, and PBEAMn. Different properties can refer to the same MATRIG
entry forming one rigid body.
5.If the fields VX, VY, VZ, WX, WY, and WZ are blank, then the initial conditions of the rigid body
are calculated from the initial velocities on the TIC and TIC1 entries referring to grid points attached
to the rigid body. The net initial conditions are the average of those for all the grid points attached to
the rigid body.
If the initial conditions are set using the VX, VY, VZ, WX, WY, and WZ fields, the TIC and TIC1
entries referring to grid points attached to the rigid body are ignored.
6.If the inertia tensor or the coordinates of the center of gravity are undefined, then they will be
computed from the density or mass and the geometry of the mesh defining the rigid body.
7.The inertia tensor can only be defined in a local rectangular coordinate system. If the entry for a local
coordinate system is left blank, then the inertia tensor is defined in the global coordinate system.
8.The center of gravity can be defined in a local rectangular coordinate system (CID). However, XC

Remarks:
1.If TYPE =“NLELAST”, then MID may refer to a MAT1 entry only.  Also, the stress -strain data
given in the TABLES1 entry will be used to determine the stress for a given value of strain.  The values
H, YF, HR, LIMIT1, and LIMIT2 will not be used in this case.
Thermoelastic analysis with temperature-dependent material properties is available for linear and
nonlinear elastic isotropic materials (TYPE =“NLELAST”) and linear elastic anisotropic materials.&lt;br&gt;
Four options of constitutive relations exist.  The relations appear in Table 19 along with the required
Bulk Data entries.
In Table 19  and  are the stress and strain vectors,  the elasticity matrix,  the effective
elasticity modulus, and E the reference elasticity modulus.
2.If TYPE =“PLASTIC”, the elastic stress-strain matrix is computed from MAT1 entry, and then the
isotopic plasticity theory is used to perform the plastic analysis. In this case, either the table
identification TID or the work hardening slope H may be specified, but not both.  If the TID is
omitted, the work hardening slope H must be specified unless the material is perfectly plastic.  The
plasticity modulus ( H) is related to the tangential modulus ( ET) byTable 9-27  Yield Functions Versus LIMIT1 and LIMIT2

3.If TID is given, TABLES1 entries (Xi, Yi) of stress -strain data  must conform to the
following rules (see Figure 9-99):
•If TYPE = &amp;ldquo;PLASTIC&amp;rdquo;, the stress-total strain curve (i.e., TYPE in TABLES1 must be 1) must be
defined in the first quadrant. The first point must be at the origin (X1 = 0, Y1 = 0) and the second
point (X2, Y2) must be at the initial yield point (Y1 or 2c) specified on the MATS1 entry. The
slope of the line joining the origin to the yield stress must be equal to the value of E. Also, TID
may not reference a TABLEST entry.
The stress-total strain curve has 2 different definitions
•For conventional element, small strain formulation in terms of engineering strain and stress is
used. Therefore, engineering stress-strain curve should be used here.
•For advanced nonlinear element, large strain formulation in terms of logarithmic strain and true
stress is adopted. Then true stress-logarithmic strain curve should be used.
Note that SOL 106 and SOL 129 supports conventional element only.  SOL 400 supports both
of the conventional and advanced elements.HET

For TYPE = &amp;ldquo;PLASTIC&amp;rdquo;, it should be noted that for conventional elements, strains should be
below .05 to small strain formulation. Within this strain range, difference between logarithmic
strain and engineering strain may be negligible.  If the element strains exceed .05, then it is
recommended to use the MATEP entry which will automatically switch to a large strain
formulation in SOL 40 0
•If TYPE =“NLELAST”, the full stress -strain curve (- &amp;lt;x&amp;lt;) may be defined in the first and
the third quadrant to accommodate different uniaxial compression data.  If the curve is defined
only in the first quadrant, then the curve must start at the origin (X1 =0.0, Y =0.0) and the
compression properties will be assumed identical to tension properties.

should be associated with an incompressible formulation (IPS for 2D plane strain, IAX for 2D
axisymmetric and ISOL for 3D tetrahedral.   Note also that, prior to MD Nastran 2010, if the
property extensions were missing, then for supported elements (i.e., PROD, PBEAML, PSHELL

Remarks:
1.The MATEP Bulk Data entry with the same MID must exist for MATTEP to be effective. All the
fields defined in MATTEP correspond to the same fields of MATEP. The value in a particular field
of the MATEP entry is replaced or modified by the table referenced in the corresponding field of this
entry.
2.The table represents yield stresses as a function of temperature. Therefore, the curve should comprise
the initial stress from Y0 or FID field on MATEP (most likely at room temperature). T(Y0) field
accommodates FID field in case FID field defines the initial yield stress instead of Y0 field. In this
case, the yield stresses at any plastic strain will be scaled by the same ratio as the initial yield stress at
the same temperature.
3.The table represents a normalized plasticity moduli (work hardening slope) as a function of
temperature.
4.Temperature dependent stress-strain curves may be entered in a general manner using the T(FID)
option. The integer value entered in this field represents the ID of a TABLEST entry which provides
IDs of TABLES1 stress-plastic strain curves vs. temperature. All such curves must be entered as stress
vs. plastic strain. No curves should be referenced on the MATS1 entry. For this option T(Y0) and
T(H) should be left blank and if entered, SOL 400 will re-set them to blank if T(FID) is a positive
integer.
5.This entry must be used in conjunction with MAT1, MATEP and MATT1 all with the same MID.
The MATT1 entry must have at least one non-blank entry in fields 3-7 of the primary MATT1 entry.Identification number of TABLEMi entry for temperature dependent

used only by the DCMP target application. They will be ignored by other target applications.
9.The MDTRATIO and MDTSTATS keywords apply to both translational and rotational degrees of
freedom unless modified by the T or R describer. Separate output is produced for each of the
translational and rotational degrees of freedom in the matrix.
10. The MDTRATIO and MDTSTATS CHART option default produces a chart of values contained
in powers of ten bandwidths. A specification for the nsegs describer causes the bandwidth to be
internally computed to produce nsegs bars. Bars are produced for the bandwidths only if they contain
terms.
11. MDTRATIO and MDTSTATS keywords are processed in the order given. It is possible for a
keyword to modify the effects of a previously processed keyword. For example, the combination
CHART, CHARTR=5 produces different outputs compared to CHARTR= 5, CHART.
12. The MDTRATIO NMAXRAT describer limits the content of the TABLE output to the specified
highest number of diagonal ratios that exceed the value of the MAXRAT describer.
13. MDTSTATS generates output for matrix diagonal term values. For the TABLE option, it produces
a table containing the NMINVAL=nmin smallest terms smaller than MINVAL=vmin as well as the
NMAXVAL=nmax largest terms larger than MAXVAL=vmax.
14. The ORDMETH option must be one of PRDMD, PRDMETIS, or PRDSMPMS  for PRDLDL and
PRDLU.
15. The C OMPMETH option is ignored  for PRDLDL and PRDLU .
16. The DOMAINSOLVER (RUNOPT= MULTIPAR)  option is not supported with PRDLDL or
PRDLU.
17. For PRDLDL and PRDLU, if there is not sufficient memory for an in-core solver, then an out-of-
core solver will be attempted and performance will be negatively affected.
18. The following special rules apply for PRDLDL for NLSOLV:
a.The maximum number of threads used is given by DMP*SMP, and PRDLDL will choose a
number of threads, up to this maximum, most suitable to the problem size.
b.PRDLDL is supported only when FNT or PFNT method is used for nonlinear iteration
(KMETHOD of NLPARM or NLSTEP).
c.If the problem fails to converge with PRDLDL, then add MDLPRM,LMT2MPC,1 to the bulk
data section in order to convert Lagrange multipliers to MPCs.
19. The following special rules apply for PRDLDL for DCMP:
a.DMP is not supported for PRDLDL for DCMP as it only gets parallelism from SMP&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SPARSESOLVER
Sparse Solver Options170
Main Index
b.PRDLDL automatically provides parallelization over multiple RHSs with SMP.
c.If PRDLDL encounters a zero pivot issue (SFM 11332), the user should rerun with bulk data
entry MDLPRM,PRDMTYPE,-2 to have Intel MKL Pardiso regard the matrix as indefinite, and
entry MDLPRM,PRDWMTCH,0 in order to turn off weighted matching.
20. The following special rules apply for PRDLU for CEAD:
a.PRDLU is only supported for the CLAN option within CEAD (refer to CMETHOD option).
21. The following special rules apply for PRDLU for FRRD1:
a.The Krylov solver is not supported with PRDLU for FRRD1.
b.DMP is supported for PRDLU for FRRD1.
c.MKL Pardiso is not supported in the uncoupled solution algorithm for FRRD1.
d.MKL Pardiso is the default solver for FRRD1 except for the following cases:
– SOL 111 symmetric solution without frequency dependence, in which case MSCLDL is used.
– Iterative solver specified by user.
22. For CEAD, the default solver matrix decomposition is PRDLU(Pardiso).
23. User specified factorization method (fmeth) via SPARSESOLVER entry or SYSTEM(209) may be
overwritten automatically due to matrix type or symmetry by MSC Nastran.
24. Several options for Intel MKL Pardiso are controlled using the MDLPRM  bulk data entry. See the PRD*
parameters detailed in the MDLPRM section.
25. Mumps sparse direct solver with DCMP and NLSOLV module is currently supported in SOL 101
only.
26. The Mumps sparse direct solver with READ only supports DMP with
DOMAINSOLVER MODES (PARTOPT=FREQ, NCLUST=NDMP)
For example, when using DMP=4 and the Mumps solver in the READ module, use
SPARSESOLVER READ (FACTMETH=MUMPS)
DOMAINSOLVER MODES (PARTOPT=FREQ, NCLUST=4)&lt;/p&gt;

Thermo-Visco-Elastic Material Properties
Main Index
2.The viscoelastic behavior is especially noticeable in the organic high polymers. There are many
different kinds of such materials including various plastics, natural and synthetic rubbers. Their
mechanical properties depend strongly on temperature, and these properties change drastically in the
vicinity of a critical temperature called the glass-transition temperature . The polymer well below
is an organic glass with a relatively high modulus. The viscoelastic behavior predominates in the
transition range around . The polymer above the transition region (but below the melting point)
becomes a rubbery solid with a low modulus.
Polymers are broadly classified as amorphous polymers and polycrystalline polymers. Under stress-
relaxation at a constant strain in the glass-transition region temperature, the amorphous polymer
exhibits a phase change over time from the glassy state to the rubbery state. The response is manifested
in the shear modulus as a function of time, in which initially high shear modulus changes into low
shear modulus. The relaxation curve of the modulus in a log-log scale plot appears as a flat plateau of
glassy modulus  shifting down to the equilibrium modulus  at the rubbery plateau. Such a
relaxation behavior of the amorphous polymer is observed even when the temperature is well below
for a prolonged period of time in a very slow process. A similar behavior is found in the rubbery
elastic region, but the process is faster.&lt;br&gt;
Fortunately, the mechanical properties of amorphous polymers obey a time-temperature
superposition principle, which allows the use of data obtained at different temperatures to extend the
time scale at any given temperature. For such a behavior, the amorphous polymer is characterized as
thermo-rheologically simple (TRS). Since the relaxation process extends several decades on the
logarithmic time scale at lower temperatures, it is not feasible to determine the whole curve by a
constant strain test at one temperature. Instead, the relaxation characteristics are measured at elevated
temperatures in reduced time scale. Then the polymers exhibit a translational shift of all the
characteristic responses with a change of temperature along the logarithmic time axis. This shift
occurs parallel to the time axis without a change in properties: glassy and rubbery moduli. The
modulus curve shifts towards shorter time with an increased temperature.
3.The reduced ( ), or pseudo, time is related to the actual time  through a shift function which is
a function of temperature, i.e. ,
where  is a shift function in terms of temperature  at time . The shift function is a material
property and must be determined experimentally. A shift function approximated by Williams-

10. For hyper-elastic(or plastic) materials. the deformation gradient is available for bricks and shells in the
user-defined material subroutines, the variable IHYPER on the material card should be set to 1. The
deformation gradient  components F11, F21, F31, F12, F22, F32, F13, F23 and F33can be found in the
history variables array in positions IDATA2+1 to IDATA2+9, the positions coming right after the
requested number of history variables.  For shell elements, the components of the deformation
gradient are with respect to the co-rotational system for the element currently used. In this case the
third row of the deformation gradient, the components F31, F32 and F33 will not be properly updated
when entering the user-defined material routine. These components depend on the thickness strain
increment which in turn must be determined so that the normal stress in the shell vanishes. For a
given thickness strain increment d3, these three components, f31, f32 and f33, can be determined by
calling the subroutine. For hyper-elastic materials there are push forward operations that can be called
from within the user defined subroutines too. If the local coordinate system option is invoked
(IDATA3=1), then the deformation gradient is transformed to this local system prior to entering the
user-defined material routine according to:
where  refers to a transformation between the current global and material frames. For IDATA
equal to 3 one can choose to put IHYPER equal to -1 which results in that the deformation gradient
is transformed according to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where  is the transformation between the reference global and material and frames. For this latter
option the spatial frame remains the global one so the stresses should be expressed in this frame of
reference upon exiting the user defined routines. The suitable choice of IHYPER depends on the
formulation of the material model.  For shells, there is also the option of setting IHYPER=3 which
will make the deformation gradient computed from the nodal coordinates and in the global
coordinate system. With this option the user must compute the stress in the local system of interest,
whence a transformation matrix between the global and this local system is passed to the user material
routines. The columns in this matrix correspond to local basis vectors expressed in global coordinates,
and this is the system that stress needs to be computed in. The user must be aware that since the
deformation gradient is calculated directly from the element deformation it may not be consistent
with the theory of the element that is used for the material. Also, the thickness used in the calculations
is constant and there is currently no thickness change treatment for this option.  In the following, a
Neo-Hookean material is used as an example of the usage of the deformation gradient in user-defined
materials. With ? and ? being the Lame parameters in the linearized theory, the strain energy density
for this material is given by :

Remarks:
1.This option is used together with MATUDS to define a generic material model.
2.Only enter those fields necessary for the analysis being performed.
3.For SOL 400, IKINEM should be greater than 0 and user subroutine HYPELA2 is used.
4.The generic material  model is able to represent a nonlinear material behavior. For this constitutive
theory, it is assumed that
where L is a function of the mechanical strain and g is a function of the temperature.
The stress and strains are true stresses and logarithmic strains, respectively, when used in conjunction
with large strain requests.
When used in conjunction with PARAM,LGDISP,1 (without large strain) the above equation is
expressed as
where E and S are the Green-Lagrange strain and second Piola-Kirchhoff stress, respectively.
5.For the MD_HYPELA2 user subroutine,  in order to provide an accurate solution,  a tangent stiffness
should be evaluated at each  iteration. In addition, the total stress should be defined as its exact value
at the end of the increment.  This allows the residual  load correction to work effectively.  In
MD_HYPELA2, additional information is available regarding the kinematics of deformation. In
particular, the deformation gradient (F), rotation tensor (R), and the eigenvalues ( ) and
eigenvectors (N) to form the stretch tensor (U) are also provided. This information is available only
for the continuum elements namely: plane strain , plane stress, axisymmetric, axisymmetric with twist,
and three-dimensional cases.
6.TREF is used as the reference temperature for the calculation of the thermal loads. TEMPERATURE
(INITIAL) may be used for this purpose, in which case TREF should be blank
7.Note that the structural damping will change with time, to obtain the damping coefficient, multiply

Visco-Elastic Material Properties2168
Main Index
Remarks:
1.The material identification number must be unique for all MAT1, MAT2, MAT3, MAT8, MAT9,
MATDIGI, MATG, MATHE, MATHP, MATNLE, MATORT, MATPE1, MATSMA,
MATUSR, MCOHE, MIXTURE, and MATD* entries.
2.The time-dependent behavior in the viscoelastic material is modeled by a Prony series expression for
both small and large strain problems. The stress relaxation behavior can be modeled by relaxation
functions of the shear modulus and bulk modulus and total strain energy in terms of a series of
exponential decay terms, which is known as the Prony series. This is equivalent to the generalized
Maxwell model, which consists of many Maxwell models connected in parallel along with an elastic
spring representing a long-term behavior. The constitutive behavior of viscoelasticity depends not
only on the current state of stress and strain, but also on the entire history of the development of these
states. Such a behavior is most readily expressed by hereditary or Duhamel integral. The Prony series
is a discrete form of this hereditary integral.
3.ISO1 supports both volumetric and deviatoric viscoelastic behavior by allowing deviatoric terms (Gi
and Tdi) and volumetric terms (Ki and Tvi) in the Prony series. The shear and bulk moduli for
isotropic material (ISO1) can be expressed in a Prony series as Describer Meaning
MID Identification number of primary material (M AT1 or MAT3 or MAT8 or MATROT or
MATHE ) entry . (Integer &amp;gt; 0). See Remark 2.
Model Selects a visco-elastic model defining time-dependent deformation behavior (Character):
ISO1 for isotropic materials referenced by MAT1 (Default) (an alternate name is Linear).
ORTHO  if referenced by MAT3, MAT8 and M ATORT .
MOONEY 1 for Mooney-Rivlin model if referenced by MATHE.
OGDEN 1 for Ogden model if referenced by MATHE.

where instantaneous values are given by:
In terms of instantaneous values, the shear and the bulk modulus relaxation can also be written as.
If a Prony series is selected, at least one set of modulus and time constant must be provided i.e., (G1,
Td1) and /or (K1, Tv1).
4.ORTHO supports only deviatoric viscoelastic behavior by allowing deviatoric terms (Gij and Tdi) in
the Prony series. For orthotopic material behavior, the relaxation coefficients are applied to the shear
modulus as
where  is the shear modulus for nth term is Prony series (Real &amp;gt; 0; Default = 0) for Orthotopic

where Wi are weighting factors  and Ti are time constants. Two Prony series can be formed
based on deviatoric and volumetric strain energy . If a viscous hyperelastic Prony series
is selected, at least one pair of weighting factor and time constant must be provided: (Wd1, Td1) and
/or (Wv1, Tv1). OGDEN support both deviatoric (Wdi, Tdi) and volumetric strain energy (Wvi,
Tvi) Prony series. However, Mooney supports only deviatoric strain energy (Wdi, Tdi) Prony series.
Foam is defined in total strain energy density function and specified through Wi and Ti.
6.If ALPHAS or ALPHAL is specified, the thermal expansion coefficient specified in MAT1, MATT1,
MATHE, MATTHE, MATORT or MATTORT will be ignored. Use of ALPHAS or ALPHAL
requires the MATTVE Narayanaswami model.
7.If the weighting factor is left blank, the relaxation function corresponding to that coefficient is
omitted.
8.In SOL 400, MATVE is used only supported for elements with property extensions. This implies that
for such elements, PBAR / PBARL, PBEAM / PBEAML, PCOMP / PCOMPG, PROD, PSHEAR,
PSHELL, PLPLANE and PSOLID should be associated with PBARN1, PBEMN1, PSHLN1,
PRODN1, PSHEARN, PSHLN1, PSHLN2 and PSLDN1 respectively. Note that, prior to MSC
Nastran 2010, if the property extensions were missing, then the MATVE data was not considered in
the element’s formulation. If the property extensions are missing, they are automatically added with
appropriate settings by the program unless the user has set NLMOPTS,SPROPMAP,-1 in the bulk
data.
9.FOAM (FOAM1) no difference between deviatoric and volumetric multipliers and relaxation time.
Program will use deviatoric input to apply on entire strain energy function.
Notes:
1.The Prony series uses values of Gi or Ki for Isotropic and Orthotropic materials. It uses weighting
(Wi) functions for Mooney, Ogden and Foam materials.
2.The instantaneous material properties are specified on primary material entries (i.e., for MAT1 or
MAT3 or MAT8 or MATORT or MATHE)
3.In the MATVE entries, material properties with the Prony series parameters are specified.
4.MATVE with “ISO”, “MOONEY”, “OGDEN”, “FOAM” models are similar to the corresponding
“ISO1”, “MOONEY1”, “OGDEN1”, “FOAM1” models with the only exception being that the
former models are limited to 5 terms in the Prony series. With the latter models, there is no limit to
the number of terms in the Prony series.i0

Remarks:
1.This MATVP entry is activated if a MAT1, MAT2, MATORT, or MAT9 entry with the same MID
is specified in an implicit nonlinear analysis. This creep capability is available for isotropic,
orthotropic, and anisotropic elasticity, which can be coupled with plasticity using MATEP entry.
Coupling with plasticity is allowed only for selected plasticity models, which include von Mises, Hill’s
anisotropy (creep stays isotropic), and Mohr-Coulomb models. However, viscoelasticity (MATVE)
cannot be combined with viscoplasticity (MATVP).
Note that ANAND solder creep model may be associated with isotropic material, i.e., MAT1, only.
2.The creep behavior of the material is expressed in terms of creep strain rate as a product of a number
of terms (functions of effective stress, equivalent creep strain, temperature, and time) in exponential
form, i.e.,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Power-Law creep (exponential form) can be used with either explicit or implicit creep methods. The

Viscoplastic or Creep Material Properties - SOL400
Main Index
a.Explicit creep can be combined with other plasticity options defined through the MATEP card.
The supported plasticity models include Von Mises, Hill’s Anisotropy (creep remains isotropic)
and Mohr-Coulomb models. The creep and plastic strains are treated separately with the
algorithm handling the creep in an explicit manner and handling the plasticity in an implicit
manner.
b.Implicit power law creep can be combined with the Von Mises yield criterion defined through the
MATEP card. Both the creep and plasticity are handled simultaneously through an implicit
viscoplasticity algorithm and a combined inelastic strain is computed.
c.The dependence of time (Q) is specified as function of total equivalent creep strain i.e.,
.
Note that the creep strain rate is internally computed as:
The creep strain from the creep material is a permanent strain unlike the creep strain for materials
using the CREEP Bulk Data entry. As such, this creep material may be classified as viscoplastic
material. This creep capability is provided for the primary and the secondary creep behavior,
because the tertiary creep involves material instability such as necking.
3.See associated Bulk Data entry, NLMOPTS
4.For NLSTEP adaptive stepping, use of TABSCTL to specify user criteria on creep strains and stresses
is also recommended. MATVP is used only supported for elements with property extensions. This
implies that for such elements, PBAR / PBARL, PBEAM / PBEAML, PCOMP / PCOMPG, PROD,
PSHEAR, PSHELL, PLPLANE and PSOLID should be associated with PBARN1, PBEMN1,
PSHLN1, PRODN1, PSHEARN, PSHLN1, PSHLN2 and PSLDN1 respectively. Note that, prior
to MD Nastran 2010, if the property extensions were missing, then the MATVP data was not
considered in the element&amp;rsquo;s formulation. From MD Nastran 2010 onwards, if the property extensions
are missing, they are automatically added with appropriate settings by the program unless the user has
set NLMOPTS, SPROPMAP, -1 in the bulk data.
5.When used with PBAR, PBEAM, PBEAML, PCOMP, PCOMPG, PROD, PSHEAR, PSHELL or
PLPLANE (with BEH=PSTRS) the explicit formulation must be used, set VALC3=0 on
NLMOPTS.
6.Flow equation for Anand Solder model is given by:
where A is the pre-exponential factor; Q is the activation energy; m is the strain rate sensitivity;  is
the multiplier of stress, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol/K); T is the absolute temperature; s is

7.To activating creep analysis with ANAND creep model, the following parameters are mandatory:
a.In Bulk Data Card NLMOPTS: keyword “CREEP” and “LRGSTRN” must be selected with
value:
“LRGSTRN” with value 1 for updated Lagrange formulation, Hypo-elasticity and additive
plasticity with mean normal value.
“CREEP” with valc3=1, Implicit Creep on; and valc4=0/1/2, for elastic tangent as default (Blank
or 0), 1 for secant tangent, and 2 for Radial Return,  respectively.
b.In Bulk Data Card NLSTEP: CREEP in “GENERAL” is required for ANAND creep model.
c.In Bulk Data Card MATVP: material parameters of ANAND creep model are defined in
MATVP card with keyword “ANAND” in the 3rd field and following 9 fields.
8.NLSTRESS in Case Control will output the equivalent creep strain on grid point. To output the

Defines a Contact Table for Bodies in Different Modules
Main Index
MDBCTB1 specifies a list of contact pairs (for bodies residing in different Modules) through the
MDBCNCT option for SOL 101  and SOL 400 . This contact table is activated in the BCONTACT Case
Control command.
Format:
Examples:
Remarks:
1.MDBCTB1 defines surface contact. If MDBCTB1 does not exist, the Case Control command
BCONTACT=BCID may refer to the MDBCNCT Bulk Data entry directly.
2.If neither MDBCTB1 nor MDBCNCT is given, the default for contact analysis is assumed, every
body detects the possibility of contact relative to all other bodies and itself if it is a deformable body.
If MDBCTB1 or MDBCNCT is given, the default for everybody is overwritten. The touching body
does not contact itself unless requested. When the touched body is deformable, double-sided contact
is applied by default. MDBCTB1 or MDBCNCT is useful for deactivating or activating bodies to
reduce computational effort and to change contact conditions between subcases.
3.For SOL s 101  and 400 , the MDBCTB1 or MDBCNCT with ID=0 will be used in loadcase 0
automatically that does not need a corresponding Case Control command BCONTACT=0. The
loadcase 0 is purely elastic and it can also be used to (1) move rigid contact bodies so that they just
touch flexible contact bodies, and/or (2) remove any prestressed condition by adjusting the
coordinates of the active nodes, which are the Grid Points on the surface of all deformable MDBCTB1 Defines a Contact Table for Bodies in Different Modules

2.MDCONCT, MDBNDRY and MDEXCLD entries can be used to augment the search procedure
and/or override the global tolerance.
3.For combined automatic and manual boundary search, the METHOD=”AUTO” should be specified
and connections should be specified on a MDCONCT entry.
4.TOL&amp;rsquo;s default of zero means that the default value will be taken from the user PARAMeter
CONFAC. CONFAC&amp;rsquo;s default is 1.0E-5. Furthermore, TOL on MDBULK is the default value for
TOL on all MDCONCT entries referencing MODID. In other words, TOL is the default value that
can be modified between two Modules by providing the required tolerance on the MDCONCT
entry.
5.MDBULK may only be specified in the Main Bulk Data Section and cannot be placed in other
BEGIN MODULE sections . MDBULK is meaningful only if modules (using BEGIN MODULE )
or external modules created by employing the EXTMDOUT Case Control command exist in the
data.
6.This entry is only valid if Modules exist.
7.With MDBULK,ALL the TYPE and RMODID fields must be blank and MDBULK,ALL means
that the MDBULK options METHOD and TOL will be applied to all Modules which are not
already defined on an MDBULK entry.
8.TYPE=&amp;ldquo;MOVE&amp;rdquo; refers to the enhanced interface.  If TYPE=&amp;ldquo;MOVE&amp;rdquo; then an MDMOVE Bulk
Data entry must be defined.  The MDMOVE entry references MDTRAN, MDROTi, and MDMIRi
entries.
a.If TYPE=&amp;ldquo;MOVE&amp;rdquo; is specified for a given Module, then MDLOC and MDMPLN cannot be
specified and vice-versa.
b.If MDMIRi is referenced by MDMOVE then it must be the first MVID and cannot be specified
as the second or subsequent MVIDs.
c.If MODID defines a secondary Module (RMODID&amp;gt;0) then it will automatically inherit all of
the Primary Module&amp;rsquo;s Bulk Data.   The inheritance of a particular entry may be overridden by
specifying new Bulk Data entries or ignored via the EXCLUDE Bulk Data entry in the secondary
Module&amp;rsquo;s Bulk Data section.
d.A primary Module (RMODID=0) may be re-positioned as indicated in Remark 10.
9.TYPE=”REPEAT” and “MIRROR” refer to the classic interface. These types have many common
features, but they also have some important differences. These are described below:
a.The following comments apply to both TYPE=”REPEAT” and “MIRROR”:
•A Module (MODID) whose TYPE is “REPEAT” or “MIRROR” and RMODID is greater than
0 is referred to as a secondary Module. The RMODID specified in this case is regarded as the
primary Module.
•The module must be a primary module . It must be defined via its own MDBULK entry
wherein TYPE must be “PRIMARY ”.
•The primary Module may be re-positioned as indicated in Remark 10.
•External Modules cannot be mirrored or repeated&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MDBULK
Module Type Definitions2194
Main Index
•If MODID defines a secondary Module then it will automatically inherit all of the Primary
Module&amp;rsquo;s Bulk Data.   The inheritance of a particular entry may be overridden by specifying
new Bulk Data entries or ignored via the EXCLUDE Bulk Data entry in the secondary
Module&amp;rsquo;s Bulk Data section.
•If both an MDLOC and MDMPLN entry are specified for a secondary Module, then a mirror
image copy of the primary Module will be created by first using the plane defined by the
MDMPLN entry and then repositioned at the location implied by the MDLOC entry.
•If the primary module specified by RSEID is an external module resulting from the use of the
EXTMDOUT Case Control command in an earlier job, then the copied external module will
be an “a-set” copy of the “primary” external module. In this case, the boundary, loads,
constraints and reduction procedure of the copied external module are set and are the same as
those of its “primary” external module.
b.The following comments apply only to TYPE= “REPEAT”:
•The secondary Module in this case may reference an MDLOC entry, an MDMPLN entry or
both or none.
•If it references an MDLOC entry, then an identical copy of its primary Module will be
positioned at the location implied by the MDLOC entry.
•If it references an MDMPLN entry, then a mirror image copy of the primary Module will be
positioned using the plane defined by the MDMPLN entry.
•If it references neither an MDLOC entry nor an MDMPLN entry, then the secondary Module
will merely be a duplicate of the primary Module positioned at the same location as the primary
Module. This usage is extremely uncommon. Hence the program cautions the user about this
usage by issuing a user warning message
c.The following comments apply only to TYPE= “MIRROR”:
•The secondary Module in this case must reference an MDMPLN. (Otherwise, the program will
terminate the execution with an appropriate user fatal message.)
•If the secondary Module references only an MDMPLN entry, then a mirror image copy of the
primary Module will be positioned using the plane defined by the MDMPLN entry.
10. A Module whose TYPE is “PRIMARY” (or TYPE=”MOVE” and RMODID=0) may itself be
repositioned by the use of MDLOC or MDMPLN entry or both (or MDTRAN, MDROTi or
MDIRi or any combination).
a.If it references an MDLOC (or MDTRAN, MDROTi) entry, then the primary Module will be
positioned at the location implied by the MDLOC (or MDTRAN, MDROTi) entry.
b.If it references an MDMPLN (or MDMIRi) entry, then a mirror image of the primary Module
will be repositioned using the plane defined by the MDMPLN (or MDMIRi) entry.
c.If it references both an MDLOC (or MDTRAN, MDROTi) entry and an MDMPLN (or
MDMIRi) entry, then a mirror image of the primary Module will first be created using the plane
defined by the MDMPLN (or MDMIRi) entry and then repositioned at the location specified by
the MDLOC (or MDTRAN, MDROTi) entry.&lt;/p&gt;

Remarks:
1.MDCONCT may only be specified in the Main Bulk Data Section and cannot be placed in other
BEGIN MODULE sections.
2.TOL&amp;rsquo;s default of zero means that the default value will be taken from TOL on MDBULK. If no
MDBULK exists for module MODID or MIDi, or if MDBULK does exist but TOL is unspecified
on the MODID&amp;rsquo;s or MIDi&amp;rsquo;s MDBULK entry, then the default value will be taken from user
PARAMeter CONFAC. CONFAC&amp;rsquo;s default is 1.0E-5.
3.The continuation entry is optional when used in automatic searching.
4.The GIDi selections must be all of the same class, grids or scalar points.
5.All six degrees-of-freedom of grids will be defined as boundary degrees-of-freedom.
6.This entry is only valid if Modules exist.

9.For TYPE=“MERGE”, the boundary grids will be moved to the location specified by MODID and
connected by an RBE2 element.
10. For TYPE=“MRBE2”, the boundary grids will be moved to the location specified by MODID and
only those grids that are specified as the independent grids on RBE2 elements will be used to connect
the Modules.   If any of the GIDi grids are not specified as independent grids on RBE2 elements or
there are no RBE2 elements then the run will terminate with User Fatal Message 6717.
11. For TYPE=“RIGID”, the boundary grids will not be moved and will be connected via RBE2
elements.
12. For TYPE=“RRBE2”, the boundary grids will not be moved and only those grids that are specified as
the independent grids on RBE2 elements will be used to connect the Modules. If any of the GIDi
grids are not specified as independent grids on RBE2 elements or there are no RBE2 elements then
the run will terminate with User Fatal Message 6717.
13. When GRID is used, then this identification/location will be used for the independent point of the
RBE2 element.
14. When scalar points are specified for GIDi, then GRID, X, Y, Z, MODID and CID should not be
specified.
15. If any GIDi are not connected due to exceeding TOL then User Fatal Message 6783 will be issued.
16. If METHOD=&amp;ldquo;AUTO&amp;rdquo; on the MDBULK entry and there are no MDCONCT entries specified for

GMOVR3 In SOL400, RIGID=LAGRANGE, for any RBE3 element with REFGRID grid
coincident with all its connected Gi,j nodes, a small perturbation is applied to the Gi,j
nodes.
The RBE3 element is a least square fit element, where a matrix, A=ST W S is formed. S
is a skew-symmetric matrix of coordinate differences and W is a weighting matrix. For
least squares, the A matrix must be inverted and for connections such as a cascading
system (shown in figure), in SOL400 nonlinear analysis (RIGID=LAGRANGE
required) where rotations are considered, the Collector RBE3 “Master REFGRID” grid
should not be coincident with the coincident RBE3 weighted Gi,j nodes as a “small”
length is necessary to provide rotation information. T o correct this condition, a small
perturbation is provided to ALL connected Gi,j nodes of (xk + v, yk + v, zk + v).
The Gi,j nodes are the preferred nodes to move, because, often they are just the spatial
locations where FEM models from different groups join a common structural
component and the REFGRID is often an actual structural mesh node.
This entry only affects RBE3 elements meeting the following criterion:
1.Let xq, yq, zq be the coordinates of the REFGRID and xk, yk, zk the coordinates of one
of the connected Gi,j nodes.
2.If |xk - xq|, |yk -yq|, and |zk - zq| are all less than or equal to GMOVR3T
(default=0.001) for ALL connected Gi,j nodes, the grids are considered coincident.
(Integer; Default = -1)
-1 Do not check coincidence
0 Check coincidence but do not perturb. The program issues a fatal
message and aborts run while coincidence happens.
1 Perturbate all coincident coordinates of the connected Gi,j nodes.
2 Perturbate the coincident REFGRID grid.
3 GMOVR3 Perturbation is overwritten for the Gi,j nodes of specific
RBE3 elements in SOL400, RIGID=LAGRANGE, for any RBE3
element with REFGRID grid coincident with all its connected Gi,j
nodes. For elements not overwritten case, set GMOVR3 = 1. The
elements to be overwritten are defined on a GMOVR3 Bulk Data entry.
4 GMOVR3 Perturbation is overwritten for the REFGRID grid of
specific RBE3 elements in SOL400, RIGID=LAGRANGE, for any
RBE3 element with REFGRID grid coincident with all its connected
Gi,j nodes. For elements not overwritten case, set GMOVR3 = 2. The
elements to be overwritten are defined on a GMOVR3 Bulk Data entry.Table 20  PARAMi Names and Descriptions

GMOVRD The Grids defined by above GMOVR3 entry will be given a v = GMOVRD value.
The user should avoid very small perturbation values as the point is to provide a finite

Model Parameters
Main Index
LROFF Large rotation offsets.  The shell normal directions are used to define
the offset direction at each shell grid for CQUAD4, CTRIA3,
CQUADR, CTRIA4, CQUAD8 and CQUAD8 elements. For beams,
WiA and Wib defines the offset direction. This method allows for
thermal load effects on ZOFF for shells and WiA and WiB for beams.
Thermal load effect for offset is computed based on the grid point or
element temperature, and thermal coefficient of the element (see
NOTHRM). The mass moment of inertia is computed for the offset
due to the grid point location change introduced by offset. Differential
stiffness is computed for the offset using the same method as that of the
Lagrange formulation of the RBA R. Not supported in SOL106,
SOL129 and SOL 200. (Character)
Note, for composite elements using PCOMP or PCOMPG, use of
LROFF requires the offset to be defined using the ZOFFS on the
corresponding element connection entries.
If the offset has been defined by the Z0 field of the PCOMP or
PCOMG entry, these entries need to be change by leaving Z0 blank on
the PCOMP or PCOMPG entries and the offset data transferred to the
ZOFFS on the corresponding element connection entries.
NODIF LROFF is used but the differential stiffness effect is turned off.&lt;br&gt;
(Character)
NOTHRM LROFF is used but the thermal load effects are turned off.  The thermal
load has two effects: 1) the location of thermal load changes due to
offset and 2) the length of offset changes due to thermal load. Effect (1)
is computed for all solution sequences and Effect (2) is computed for
SOL 400 only. Both effects are turned off by NOTHRM. (Character)
NODT LROFF is used but the differential stiffness and thermal load effect are
turned off.  (Character)
ELMZ LROFF is used but the element z-direction is used for the offset
direction. IF PARAM, SNORM, 0.0 or the computed value for
SNORM is greater then the PARAM,SNORM,value, then the LROFF
option will revert to this method for CQUAD4, CTRIA3, CQUADR,
CTRIAR, CQUAD8 and CTRIA6. This option is not applicable for
beams. (Character)
NOMASS LROFF is used but the no mass effects are included. (Character)Table 20  PARAMi Names and Descriptions

Main Index
NDMTZ LROFF is used but the element z-direction is used for the offset
direction and the differential stiffness, the thermal load effects, and the
mass effects are turned off. For CQUAD4 and CTRIA3 elements this
method should get similar results to the standard ELMOFF method.&lt;br&gt;
(Character)
Note:  This entry only effects ZOFF calculations for ZOFF specified on the shell
connection entries. For Z0 specified on the PCOMP or PCOMPG  entries , the standard&lt;br&gt;
ELMOFF  method will be used.&lt;br&gt;
If the computed value for SNORM is greater then the PARAM,SNORM,value and the
user wishes not to change the parameter value, the Bulk Data entry SNORM can be
used to override the shell normal.
Solution sequences affected: For linear - all solution sequences. For nonlinear - SOL 400
only. The LROFF method is not implemented into SOLs 106 and 129.
PEXTS4 Used in conjunction with NSGRDS4. After partitioning the spline, each of the smaller
splines will be extended by PEXTS4 in each direction (top,bottom, left and right). The
value is expressed in percent so that PEXTS4=10.0 would extend the four boundaries

ADAPT An Euler mesh will be created around a coupling surface. This option is
only valid for PROP=EULER, and requires that the MID of the MESH
is referenced from the MESHID of a COUPLE card. During the
simulation, when the coupling surface moves or deforms, the Euler
mesh will adapt itself by adding and removing elements. The adapt
algorithm ensures that the coupling surface is contained inside the Euler
mesh at all times with the minimum amount of elements. The Euler
elements are aligned with the basic coordinate.
BOX A rectangular mesh will be created, that is aligned with the basic
coordinate system. The mesh will use CHEXA elements.

adaptive elements that are within the box for one of the cycles requested are stored in the
archive. This allows multiple cycles in one Euler archive. This box should be sufficiently
large such that it contains all elements. The fields X0BX, Y0BX and Z0BX specify the
start point and DXBX, DYBX and DZBX specify the width of box. If the there are
adaptive elements outside the box the run is terminated and a larger box needs to be
specified. Only used for TYPE=ADAPT. (Real; Blank) See Remark 14.

&lt;p&gt;MESH
Mesh Generator2250
Main Index
Remarks:
1.The grid-points of the mesh are generated at following locations:
Type=ADAPT: (x,y,z)=(XREF+i&lt;em&gt;DXEL, YREF+j&lt;/em&gt;DYEL, ZREF+k&lt;em&gt;DZEL)
Grid-points and elements located a certain distance outside the coupling surface will not be created.
This saves memory and CPU time.
When (XREF, YREF, ZREF) are outside the coupling surface, no grid-point will be created at this
location, but the mesh will be shifted appropriately.
Type=BOX: (x,y,z) = (X0+i&lt;/em&gt;DXEL, Y0+j&lt;em&gt;DYEL, Z0+k&lt;/em&gt;DZEL)
Nodes and Elements will always be created, even if the MESH is referenced from the MESHID of a
COUPLE entry.
One of the following input combinations is required:
TYPE=ADAPT
a.(DXEL, DYEL, DZEL)
or
b.1
c.(DX, DY, DZ) and  (NX, NY, NZ)
 DXEL = DX/NX  ;  DYEL=DY/NY  ;  DZEL=DZ/NZ
TYPE=BOX
a.(DXEL, DYEL, DZEL) and  (NX, NY, NZ)
or
b.(DX, DY, DZ) and  (NX, NY, NZ)
 DXEL = DX/NX  ;  DYEL=DY/NY  ;  DZEL=DZ/NZ
2.When the starting grid point and/or element number is left blank, then the default start number for
the elements and grid-points is equal to the maximum number used +1. For simulations with multiple
coupling surfaces two methods of treating transport between the Euler meshes are available. One
method supports meshes of TYPE = ADAPT, but does not allow the specification of starting element
or starting grid-point number.
3.The PID should refer to an existing property id, which can handle the property type given by PROP. SIMPLE Partition Euler cubes in a simple pattern.
NPX The number of cubes in the x-direction. Required for PROCDIR=USER. (Integer,
Default=1)
NPY The number of cubes in the y-direction. (Integer, Default=NPX)
NPZ The number of cubes in the z-direction. (Integer, Default=NPX)Describer Meaning&lt;/p&gt;

4.To avoid that the Euler mesh will be resized every time-step, the functions defined by TID-X, TID-
Y, TID-Z must describe a ‘step-function’, like in this example:
i. TABLED1,1,,,,,,,,+
ii. +,0.0,1.0,,,,,,,+
iii. +,1.E-3,1.0,,,,,,,+
iv. +,1.E-3,1.1,,,,,,,+
v. +,2.E-3,1.1,,,,,,,+
vi. +,2.E-3,1.2
Which specifies following function:
5.Care must be taken when refining the Euler mesh. To avoid instabilities, it is advised to stay within
the following guidelines:
a.Each refining step, use a scale factor larger than 0.5
b.Allow the solution to become smooth again after each refining step. For airbag simulations, use
an interval larger than 5*diameter_airbag/soundspeed
6.Resizing is not available for the Multi-material solver.
7.In most cases METHOD = ALL is the preferred method. Using METHOD=MATERIAL may be
helpful in case of instabilities due to presence of void regions.
8.SUBMESH glues a fine mesh into a coarse mesh and uses the same gluing functionality as  PARAM,
GRADEDMESH. If the fine mesh is completely contained inside the coarse mesh no restrictions
apply. Then to avoid any  restrictions the grid points of the fine mesh are slightly displaced.  But if
parts of the fine mesh are outside the coarse  mesh a  restriction applies. In that case an Euler element
of the coarse mesh has to be fully active or fully inactive. This means that the coarse element should
not intersect elements of the fine mesh or it should be fully covered by the fine elements. Fine
elements are not allowed to cover any part of the coarse elements. In practice, this means that the fine
mesh has to fit nicely in the coarse mesh. For details refer to the section &amp;ldquo;Graded meshes&amp;rdquo;  in the  MSC
Nastran Explicit Nonlinear User’s Manual.1.0

&lt;p&gt;MESH
Mesh Generator2252
Main Index
When running on one cpu the elements of the Euler mesh and the submesh will be put into one euler
archve. But when running with multiple cpus, the mesh and sub mesh will be put in different euler
archives. To distinguish the archives, the name _FVX is added to the Euler archive names. Here X is
the MESH-ID MID. The Euler archive of the mesh and the submesh can be read simultaneously into
Patran.
9.A biased mesh has nonconstant element sizes in selected directories. Neighbor element size can have
a constant ratio or have identical size. In literature, this type of mesh is also referred to as a
nonuniform mesh or a locally refined mesh.
10. A block mesh consists of a number of planes in all three directions. For a nonbiased mesh, these planes
are at fixed distance from each other. In a biased mesh, the distance between subsequent planes can
differ. The varying element size is determined by:
a.IBIDX
b.GROWX
c.The constant step size specified by X0, NX, DX.
Here, IBIDX overrules GROWX and GROWX overrules the X0, NX DX specification. Likewise,
for the other directions. The locations of the planes are written out in the OUT file. Intersecting an
x-plane with a y-plane and z-plane will give a grid point. By carrying out all intersections, the grid
points are constructed.
11. Defining the CID allows for positioning the mesh box arbitrarily in space. When active, the following
restrictions apply:
MESH,ADAPT cannot be used
The use of single material Euler with strength elements is not supported
12. Setting NELCUBE, NBX, NBY, NBZ allow to divide the Euler mesh into a number of cubes. By
setting NELCUBE equal to 2000, optimal use is made of memory caching during Euler computation.
This can give a speedup of 1.5. If NBX is defined, also NBY and NBZ need to be defined. Defining
NBX overrules the definition of NELCUBE.
When using multiple Euler cubes the BARRIER and FLOW definitions only support geometric
conditions like boundary face direction and square definition.
13. There are several ways to distribute cubes across processors. Some ways may lead to bad load
balancing. To avoid this it is possible to control the way Euler cubes are distributed across processors
by defining PROCDIR.
When option PROCDIR=USER, the values for NBX, NBY, and NBZ must be such that NBX is
equal or a multiple of NPX, NBY is equal or a multiple of NPY and NBZ is equal or a multiple of
NPZ. Also for this option, NPX&lt;em&gt;NPY&lt;/em&gt;NPZ must be equal to the number of processors used in the
cluster.
For option PROCDIR=SIMPLE, the values NBX, NBY, and NBZ on DYPARAM,EULERCB must
be such that NBX&lt;em&gt;NBY&lt;/em&gt;NBZ is equal or a multiple of the number of processors used. For instance,
if the number of processors in the cluster is 4, NBX&lt;em&gt;NBY&lt;/em&gt;NBZ must be equal to either 4 or 8 or 12,
etc. Otherwise, the calculation will terminate prematurely with an error message.&lt;/p&gt;

When using these options the Barrier and FLOW definitions only support geometric conditions like
boundary face direction and a square definition
14. To determine a suitable size for the static output box, the simulation can be run first without the fields
X0BX, Y0BX, Z0BX, DXBX, DYBX, and DZBX set. In the ,OUT file each summary of adaptive
meshing gives the smallest box surrounding all adaptive elements so far. The last summary then yields
the dimension of the static output box. To accommodate for elements that are not completely inside
the box, the actual static output box is automatically extended a little. The actual dimensions are
written in the out file after the first adaptive meshing summary. Is not needed to set the XREF, YREF,
and ZREF option. If they are set the static output box will be compatible with the defined reference
point.&lt;/p&gt;

Describer Meaning
SID Set identification number.  (Integer &amp;gt;0)
CID Identification number of rectangular coordinate system used to specify the orientation
of the free surface (normal to ) and of planes of symmetry, if any.  (Integer &amp;gt;0 or
blank)
ZFS Intercept of the free surface on the X3 axis of the coordinate system referenced by CID.&lt;br&gt;
IfX3of a grid &amp;gt; ZFS then there is no fluid. See Remark 3. (Real; Default means that
the free surface is located at an infinitely large positive value of XFS.)
RHO Density of the fluid (Real).
ELIST1 Identification number of an ELIST entry that lists the IDs of two -dimensional elements
that can be wetted on one side by the fluid.  Only those elements connected to at least
one grid point below ZFS are wetted by the fluid.  See Remarks 3. and 5. (Integer &amp;gt;0)
ELIST2 Identification number of an ELIST entry that lists the IDs of two -dimensional elements
that can be wetted on both sides by the fluid.  Only those elements connected to at least
one grid point below ZFS are wetted by the fluid.  (Integer &amp;gt;0; ELIST1 +ELIST2 &amp;gt;0)
PLANE1,
PLANE2Planes of symmetry, antisymmetry, or no symmetry.  “S” means that plane 1, which is
the plane containing the X1 and X3 axes of CID, is a plane of symmetry.  “A” means
that plane 1 is a plane of antisymmetry.  “N” means that it is neither.  See Remark 5.
Plane 2 uses “S”, “A”, or “N” for the  and  plane.  (Character:  “S”, “A”, or “N”)
RMAX Characteristic length.  Interactions between elements with separation that is greater

&lt;p&gt;MFLUID
Fluid Volume Properties2256
Main Index
Remarks:
1.The MFLUID entry must be selected with the Case Control command MFLUID =SID.
2.Several MFLUID entries corresponding to different fluid volumes can be used simultaneously.
3.The wetted side of an element in ELIST1 is determined by the presence or absence of a minus sign
preceding the element’s ID on the ELIST entry. A minus sign indicates that the fluid is on the side
opposite to the  element’s positive normal, as determined by applying the right -hand rule to the
sequence of its corner points. The same element can appear on two ELIST entries, indicating that it
forms a barrier between the unconnected fluids.
4.The fluid volume may be finite (interior) or infinite (exterior).  The volume may be bounded by a
free surface and one or two planes of structural symmetry.  If structural symmetry is used, the
structure must have the symmetric or antisymmetric boundary corresponding to the selection in fields
8 and 9.  Interior fluids must have ELIST1 data and a free surface or plane of  antisymmetry.
5.The planes of symmetry and/or antisymmetry defined in fields 8 and 9 must be planes of symmetry
for the entire analysis.  The user may apply appropriate structural boundary conditions at all grid
points lying in these planes.
6.The current list of elements that may be placed in ELIST1 and ELIST2 include CTRIA3, CQUAD4,
CTRIAR, and CQUADR.
7.The continuation entry is optional.
8.If there is ELIST1 data and no free surface nor plane of antisymmetry, the program assumes a special
form of external fluid. These special external fluids must have a CID (field 3) such that the origin of
the fluid coordinate system is near the center of the enclosed volume, since the singularity for volume
change will be placed at the origin.  Special external fluids are supported only in SOLs 103 and 107
through 112. If used in conventional solution sequences, System Fatal Message 3001  results for file
205.
9.See PARAM,VMOPT in Parameters . VMOPT controls when the virtual mass is included in the mass
matrix.
10. If any MFLUID entry is changed or added on restart then a complete re-analysis may be performed.
Therefore, MFLUID entry changes or additions are not recommended on restart.
11. A tolerance is computed for each wetted element, with the value of , where A is the area
of the element. If any grid point connected to the element lies within TOL below the free surface it
is moved to the free surface.
12. Any element that has all grids on or above the free surface, after the grid points are moved by the
procedures given in Remark 11. is removed from the ELIST. It is not included in the VM effects, and
will produce no pressure output.0.012A&lt;/p&gt;

2.The range of modes LOWRNG through HIGHRNG, inclusive, will be used to track the designed
modes.  If LOWRNG and HIGHRNG are both blank, then all computed modes will be used to
search for the designed modes.  Since large numbers of computed modes will result in higher

&lt;p&gt;MONCNCM
Nondimensional Normal Force and Pitching Moment2266
Main Index
Provides a stripwise aerodynamic normal force and pitching moment coefficients for CAERO1 based
aerodynamics.
Format:
Example:
Remarks :
1.Output is produced for all chordwise strips on the referenced CAERO1 entries. If a strip spans
CAERO1 panels, results are output for the total strip.
2.If CAERID1 is the character string “ALL”, then output will be produced for all strips.
3.Strips are identified based on the y and z coordinates in the aerodynamic coordinate system.
4.If strips from separate CAERO1’s have the same y and z coordinate and the same strip width and
share an xlocation (i.e., the leading edge of one strip equals the trailing edge from another) then they
are processed as a single strip.
5.The normal force component is normalized by the dynamic pressure times the surface area of the
strip. The moment component is normalized by the dynamic pressure times the surface area of the
strip times the chord length at the center of the strip. The moment is calculated about the MREF
location of the strip with the quarter-chord of the strip as the default.

Once within the datablock description you can search for the element name (or better yet, element
number, see the following table) you are interested in. There can be several different descriptions for
an element type. For example, real vs. complex, thermal, stress vs. strain (within the OES description),
linear vs nonlinear. In addition, the shell class of elements (quad4, quad8, quadr, tria3, tria6, triar)
will have a composite form (quad4lc, quud8lc, quadrlc, tria3lc, .., i.e., basename + “LC”), corner or
bilin stresses (basename + “C”).
By looking at the comments contained in the text make sure you are reading from the appropriate
section. The NDDLitem is labeled as the ‘NAME’ field within the MSC Nastran DMAP Programmer’s
Guide .
You can also print the NDDL description for the entire database by running the following 4

&lt;p&gt;2275 MONPNT3
Integrated Load Monitor Point
Main Index
Remarks:
1.The MONPNT3 is available for SOLs 101, 103, 108, 109, 111, 112, 144, 146, 200 and 400
(ANALYSIS = NLSTAT or NLTRAN). Note that MONPNT3 output to csv file is available only to
SOL 144.
2.If ELEMSET is blank, no contributions are made from the set of elements attached to the grid.
3.Fictitious grids or elements do not produce error or warning messages.
4.For linear solution sequence s, if the exclusion flags omit some grid point force types but not all of
them (i.e; if the field is not blank and is not SMAD) then the following limitations exist:
•The results for that MONPNT3 will not be exported to a CSV file , for SOL 144 only.
•That MONPNT3 may not be used on a MONSUM, MONSUM1 or MONSUMT entry.
•It is only available in SOLs 101, 103, 144 and SOL 200 (ANALYSIS = STATICS, MODES, or
SAERO).
5.MONPNT3 can be useful in calculating shear, moment and torque from the internal loads in a
structure. For example, if a split is made in a fuselage component and all the grids that reside on this
split are placed in the GRIDSET, differing internal loads resultants can be obtained based on the
ELEMSET and XFLAG value s. If a cut is made in a structure, there are three types of loads:
A - loads that come from the elements upstream of the cut.
B - loads that are applied to the grids on the cut from any other source.
C - loads that come from the elements downstream of the cut.
Where A + B + C = 0
Useful options for these two values are:
a.If the ELEMSET includes all the elements that connect to the GRIDSET that are on the
upstream/outboard part of the split and the XFLAG value is blank then the internal load is
calculated using the elements that connect to the GRIDSET that are NOT included in
ELEMSET. The direction of this load is reversed. So actually -C will be calculated which matches
A+B. This in effect gives the resultants on the downstream/inboard side of the split pointing into
upstream/ outboard direction which will include any loads applied to the GRIDSET from any
source.
b.If the ELEMSET includes all the elements that connect to the GRIDSET that are on the
upstream/outboard part of the split and the XFLAG value is SMA D then the internal load is
calculated using the elements listed in ELEMSET. In that case, A will be calculated. This in effect
gives the resultants on the upstream/outboard side of the split and does not include loads applied
to the GRIDSET from any other source.
6.For SOL 400 (ANALYSIS = NLSTAT or NLTRAN), the following limitations exist:
•The results for that MONPNT3 will not be exported to a CSV file , for SOL 144 only .
•That MONPNT3 may not be used on a MONSUM, MONSUM1 or MONSUMT entry.
•Thermal loads are not supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MONPNT3
Integrated Load Monitor Point2276
Main Index
7.For linear solution sequences with XFLAG= blank or SMAD, the program applies a mini-EMA
(element matrix assembly) algorithm that bypasses GPFDR (grid point force data recovery) and
another modules to improve performance. This algorithm forms a stiffness matrix that just includes
those elements specified in MONPNT3 entries. The monitor point results are computed directly
from multiplying this matrix by an integration matrix that transfers forces to the monitor points.
These results may be slightly different from the GPFDR results, such as clean zero forces versus small
residual forces.&lt;/p&gt;

2.The LABEL is a 56 character string that should be unique.
3.The MONSUM can be used to update an existing monitor result by setting all the NAMEij terms
equal to NAME. In this case, the alternate format is available and the NEWAXISj component is a
scalar multiple of the original component:
MONSUMj  = MRj COEFj
4.When the NAME differs from the NAMEij values, it must be unique with respect to all monitor
quantities.The result of the MONSUM entry is to create new monitor point(s) that are equal to:

5.The merged monitor points must be of a similar type. “Similar” types are defined as:
Force and moment summation monitor points: AMONPNT1, SMONPNT1, MONPNT3
Average displacement monitor points: AMONDSP1 and SMONDSP1
6.For MONPNT1’s and MONDSP1’s, the MTYPij can be aerodynamic or structural.&lt;br&gt;
MTYPij=AMxxx1 designates aerodynamic while SMxxx1 designates a structural monitor point.
7.If multiple components are to be summed, the NEWAXISj field must be the union of subsequent

&lt;p&gt;2293 NHRMPRM
Parameters for Nonlinear frequency response analysis (SOL 128)
Main Index
Remarks:
1.Following parameters can also be specified using PARAM option: NLHRED, NHPLUS, NLHTOL,
NLHTWK, TICPNCH and MXICODE0.
See description under PARAM for more details about these variables.
In case a parameter is specified in NHRMPRM and also using PARAM, the value specified using
PARAM entry is used.
2.Parameters MNCSF or MFRINT can be used to reset initial condition in case of non-convergence.
If both these parameters are specified, the condition which is satisfied first is used.
3.CONTP =1  or 2 i s used to initiate continuation procedure method. In this case, following parameters
are not used in the analysis: NLHRED, MNCSF, MFRINT. Currently, the CONTP=1 o ption is
available for frequency-independent analysis only.
Here, NLHRED is set to 0 to not use the reduction method. And initial condition for the
continuation procedure is determined using the results from two previously converged solutions.
4.CONTP=2 does not support frequency-dependent elements, such as PBSH2DT, CBUSHD2DA,
and frequency-dependent material. For multiple rotor systems, the rotor spin ratio at unit speed (1.0
radian per unit time) is calculated and used for both SYNC and ASYNC. To make convergence faster
for a strong nonlinear system, use an ‘average’ frequency formulation (PARAM, GYROAVG, -1) or
ignore circulation terms (MDLPRM, RDBOTH, 2).
5.DECOMP option with QR is supported only with CONTP = 2 in NHRMPRM entry. If used with
CONTP = 0 or 1, a UFM will be issued.
6.It is not required to define DECOMP option when using CONTP = 0 or 1. For either of the
continuation procedure choice, default LU decomposition will be used. Refer remarks 3 and 4 for use
of frequency-dependent analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NLBSH3D
Nonlinear 3-dimensional rotor loading2296
Main Index
Defines connectivity of a three-dimensional nonlinear load as a function of relative deflection and velocity of
a grid pair which in turn is a function of rotor speed.
Format:
Remarks:
1.NLBSH3D are selected with the Case Control command NONLINEAR = SID.
2.In order to ensure correct results, GRID points GA and GB must satisfy the following three
conditions:
a.They must both be grid points
b.They must be coincident
c.They must have parallel displacement coordinate systems
The program checks for the above conditions. If they are not satisfied, the program will terminate the
run with an appropriate fatal message.
3.Multiple NLBSH3D may reference the same SID but require different GA, GB grid pairs.
4.Multiple NLBSH3D entries may refer to the same LID independent of SID.
5.Non-linear load is calculated as a function of relative deflection and velocity, which in turn are
functions of rotor speed, between GRID points GA and GB. Till version 2019FP1, non-linear load

6.The loads are applied to the DOFs of GA and GB, based on the difference in displacement (ub-ua)
or velocity (vb-va) at the 2 GRID points, according to the tables referenced on the LBSH3DG entries.
A positive difference in the displacement/velocity results in a positive force being applied to GA and
a negative force being applied to GB
7.GA and GB must have all 6 DOF in D-set. Both grids should not be dependent on any RBE or MPC
and must not be constrained by an SPC. The program checks for active DOFs of both the grids. If
they are not satisfied, the program will terminate the run with an appropriate fatal message .NLBSH3D Nonlinear 3-dimensional rotor loading

Remarks:
1.The NLHARM ID must be unique among all NLHARM entries.
2.The greater the degree of nonlinearity, the larger the number of harmonics required to find a solution
(if one exists).  The number of harmonics (NHARM) used may influence the ability of the algorithm
to find solutions to the nonlinear problem posed.  However, the larger the number of harmonics, the
more computational effort is required to find a solution.
3.The response frequencies in linear harmonic analysis are the same as the forcing frequency.&lt;br&gt;

Describer Meaning
“CREEP” Keyword that indicates that creep is possible during one or more steps in the job.  It
also indicates the formulation for creep analysis.  It should be noted that this keyword
is only valid for elements with extended property extensions (PSLDN1, PSHLN1,
etc.). (Character Default CREEP). Creep data should be entered using MATVP , not
the CREEP bulk data entry.
There are 2 kinds of creep models
(a) Explicit Creep - ValC1 and ValC2 are used for this.
valc1 0 : Maxwell Model Creep (default)
1 : Explicit Viscoplastic Creep (only supported via user subroutine
CRPLAW)
valc2 (Blank or 0) : (Default)
1: (Reserved)
(b) Implicit Creep - ValC3 and ValC4 are used for this.
valc3 0 : Implicit Creep off
1 : Implicit Creep on
valc4 (Blank or 0) : elastic tangent (Default)
1: secant tangent
2: radial return
Note that:
(1) ValC3 = 0 means Explicit Creep (see ValC1). ValC3 = 1 means Implicit Creep.
(2) ValC4 is only used in conjunction with Valc3=1. The recommended value for
ValC4 is 1 (secant tangent).
The CREEP option on NLMOPTS is generally used in conjunction with the
following bulk data entries - the user can refer to each of the bulk data entries
identified below for more information.
NLSTEP The &amp;ldquo;CREEP&amp;rdquo; field on this entry indicates that creep is active for the
particular step using the NLSTEP card. Note that the permanent creep
flag through the NLMOPTS,CREEP keyword should be turned on
along with the NLSTEP ,CREEP keyword.
MATVP The material data for creep are entered through this card. It should be
noted that the data through MATVP is only for elements with extended
property extensions. For elements without extended property extensions,
material data for creep should be specified through the CREEP entry.
MATEP Optional data for plasticity in combination with implicit or explicit creep
is specified through this entry.&lt;/p&gt;

For the SOL 400  Newton’s method, the previous exchange matrix multiplied by a function of the
temperature is added to the stiffness. If the exchange matrix is dense, which is generally the case, the
sparse stiffness matrix consequently also becomes dense, and the factorization of the stiffness matrix
becomes much more expensive.
The input options are as follows. All options with the exception of the “faccnt” option, are available
in SOLs 153, 159, and 400. The “faccnt” option is only available in SOL 400:
hemi, v alue, npixel, cutoff, fraction, faccnt, factol
where
Note that the expensive reflection term is absent. This reduced form of the radiation exchange matrix
is added to the stiffness matrix. Since the reflection matrix never is calculated and factorized, the
calculation of the radiation exchange matrix is significantly cheaper. Since this reduced radiation
exchange matrix is less dense, the factorization of the stiffness matrix also is significantly faster.
For the flux calculation, an iterative procedure is used based on iterating towards a solution
simultaneously satisfying both Poljak equations in the MSC Nastran Thermal User’s Guide , Eqs. 6-11
and 6-12, respectively.value 1 to flag hemicube method. Default is 0. The following options are available only if
value =  1.
npixel Number of pixels per quarter section, where total number of pixels = .
Default is 500.
cutoff Factor below which viewfactors will be set to zero. This one is applied during the last
viewfactor calculation. It results in a less dense exchange matrix and therefore a faster
calculation of the reflection term and of the stiffness matrix factorization. Default is
0.0.
fraction Factor below which radiation exchange matrix terms are not added to the stiffness
matrix. For each equation in the radiation exchange matrix, the fraction is multiplied
by the diagonal term, and all terms in the equation less than this value is not added
to the stiffness matrix. This procedure does not affect the density of the radiation
exchange matrix or the cost of calculating it, including the reflection term, but
reduces the density of the stiffness matrix and the cost of factorizing the stiffness
matrix. Note that the full radiation exchange matrix still is used to calculate fluxes.
Default is 0.01.
faccnt Set to 1 to activate explicit treatment of reflection matrix. Default is 0. In this

In the previous table, the Secondary Property (Column 1) is automatically flagged depending on the
Primary Property (Column 2) and the Primary/Secondary Materials (Column 4). The Comments
column (Column 5) indicates any special conditions that are followed by the program while doing
this mapping. The Unsupported Features column (Column 6) indicates the list of options on the
Primary Property entry that are not supported by the Secondary Property.
It should be noted that the Secondary Property additions offer a wide range of element formulations
that primarily cater to nonlinear extension but can also serve for linear applications. By default, the
PROPMAP field is set to 0 and maps to the full integration elements of the secondary property only
if necessary. For a less memory intensive element, the PROPMAP field can be manually set to 1 and
this then maps to the equivalent reduced integration element of the secondary property only if
available and necessary. PROPMAP field can be manually set to 2 or 3 when secondary properties
need to be tagged to all elements in the model. In this case, the special conditions given in the 5th
column above are ignored and the mapping is carried out for both linear and nonlinear materials (if
allowed). PROPMAP = 2 maps to full integration elements whenever possible and PROPMAP = 3
maps to reduced integration elements whenever possible.
a.Property mapping is considered for all possible elements (i.e., PROPMAP = 0/1 is automatically
converted to PROPMAP = 2/3) for the following conditions:
•When IDAMP (damping scheme specified through the NLSTEP entry) &amp;gt; 0 is used for static
analysis. Note that the damping scheme is only available for elements with nonlinear property
extensions.
•When CRITTID (user criteria specified through the NLSTEP entry) and the associated
TABSCTL entry refer to displacement / stress / strain criteria for all elements in the model.
Note that the user criteria are only supported for elements with nonlinear property extensions. Note:   1.Only when NLMOPTS, LRGSTRN, 1 is flagged or HGENPLAS is provided
NLSTEP entry for coupled analysis.
2.For shape memory materials, define through MATSMA only the thermo-mechanical
model is available.
3.For creep, define through MATVP , VALC=0 must be set on NLMOPTS for explicit
formulation.
4.Only when phase changes are flagged.
5.Gasket materials for BEH4=COMPS or AXCOMP ,INT4=L.
6.For shape memory materials, define through MATSMA and BEH=PLSTRS only the
thermo-mechanical model is available.
7.For creep, define through MATVP and BEH=PLSTRS VALC=0 must be set on
NLMOPTS for explicit formulation.
8.The “SPROPMAP ” does not support MATDIGI.&lt;/p&gt;

•When a small displacement analysis is flagged for thermo-mechanical coupled analysis specified
through SUBSTEP or for real-time thermo-mechanical chained analysis specified through
TEMP(LOAD,HSUB,HSTEP ,HTIME). Note that for real-time temperatures to be transferred
from the heat pass to the structural pass, all elements need to be processed in the nonlinear
program flow and this is accomplished by flagging all possible elements with nonlinear property
extensions.
b.Property mapping is provided for elements that are associated with special procedures / flags:
•Elements whose grids are specified on the VCCT Bulk Data entry. VCCT is only supported for
grids of elements with nonlinear property extensions.
•Elements that are specified on the IPSTRN / ISTRESS commands. These are only supported
for elements with nonlinear property extensions.
•Elements that are specified on the BOLT1 entry. BOLT1 is only supported for elements with
nonlinear property extensions.
It should be noted also that while the NLMOPTS,SPROPMAP option is powerful and allows a user-
friendly way to map to advanced elements, it does not provide a substitute for all cases. Defaults are
provided for the most common cases on the NLMOPTS,SPROPMAP entry itself. This includes
PROPBEH - especially useful to distinguish between plane strain and plane stress, DIRECT - the
layer thickness direction for gaskets, THICKOP - the out-of-plane thickness for the planar case. It
should be noted that these defaults are global defaults and apply to all the elements for which the
secondary properties are added. If such defaults are not applicable (for e.g., different out-of-plane
thicknesses), it is the user’s responsibility to add individual secondary property entries. No mapping
to advanced nonlinear elements takes place for PSHELL entries with MID greater than 100,000,000
to avoid conflicts with internally generated material IDs.
IPRINT can be used to get additional information on the secondary properties that have been added.
Default is 0 in which case, there is no print-out. IPRINT = 1 allows the print-out in the .f06 file,
IPRINT = 2 allows the print-out in the .pch file, IPRINT = 3 allows print-out in both the .f06 and
.pch files.

10. The vald1  value in “DEACTEL” determines in which physics pass the default deactivation rules are
applied. If vald1  is positive the deactivation rules are applied in the specified pass only and in all other
passes the defaults are switched off, meaning that in those passes all elements remain active unless a
DEACTEL Bulk Data input deactivates some of them.
The default deactivation rules are summarized in the following table:
The default for elements of all other types is that they are active in every pass.
11. The “ENTHALP” keyword is applicable to elements associated with the nonlinear property
extensions PRODN1, PSHEARN, PSHLN1, PSLDN1 and for axisymmetric heat transfer shells
specified through PAXISYM. It provides different options to form the capacitance matrix and
enthalpy vector for these elements through valclu  and valenl  respectively.
The valclu  value allows the choice of 3 different capacitance formulations: consistent, coupled
(average of consistent and lumped) and lumped. The default value of valclu = 0  allows the nonlinear
elements to follow the same scheme as that for linear elements; lumped for rods and 3D shells,
coupled for axisymmetric shells and linear hexes, pentas, tetras and consistent for quadratic hexes,
pentas and tetras. Values of valclu &amp;gt; 0  allow the user to pick specific capacitance formulations for all
elements. Example 2: 4 noded CQUAD4, PSHELL, MATF

The valenl  value allows the user the choice of 2 different enthalpy vector formulations: time
integration of the enthalpy at each integration point or product of the nodal temperature with the
capacitance. The default value of valenl = 0  allows the program to pick automatically: use the time
integration option for nonlinear specific heat / latent heat, use the nodal product option for linear
specific heat. Values of valenl &amp;gt; 0  allow the user to pick the approach. Note that for nonlinear
problems, the time integration approach is more accurate.
12. To compute the thermal loads of 3D thermal shells in a separate mechanical run, a consistent
temperature distribution type must be specified in mechanical models, i.e. LINE must be defined if
the thermal model has a linear temperature distribution using LINE, or QUAD must be specified for
the thermal model with a quadratic temperature distribution defined by QUAD.  If LINE or QUAD
is specified, the program will switch the structural shell elements to advanced elements automatically
by generating PSHLN1 entries internally if no PSHLN1 or PSHLN2 entries are specified in the
original model.
13. MSC NASTRAN thermal analysis does not differentiate between top and bottom faces while
applying loads or boundary conditions on shell, even though the top and bottom temperatures may
be different through specifying TEMPP = LINE or QUAD .
14. TEMPP keyword is supported in coupled analysis or in separate runs of thermal and mechanical
analyses. This keyword is not supported for CTRIA6 elements or in chained thermal and mechanical
analyses.
15. When using standard MSC Nastran composite elements in SOL400 nonlinear analysis, the
conventional MSC Nastran format is direct strain output as Total strain (mechanical + thermal
strains) and the shear strain as Engineering shear strain.
If the user chooses to use the Advanced Nonlinear Elements, with NLSTRESS output request, the
conventional MSC Nastran format is output with the use of the entry:
MDLPRM,COMPN1,YES&lt;br&gt;
However, the default format of strain output for the Advanced elements is Mechanical direct strains
and Scientific shear strain. To output as the conventional Total strain (mechanical + thermal strains)
and the shear strain as Engineering shear strain the entry:
NLMOPTS, INLAM, , ,1
should be used.&lt;/p&gt;

Parameters for Nonlinear Static Analysis Control2326
Main Index
Remarks:
1.The NLPARM entry  is selected by the Case Control command NLPARM =ID. Each solution
subcase requires an NLPARM command.
2.In cases of static analysis (DT =0.0) using Newton methods, NINC is the number of equal
subdivisions of the load change defined for the subcase. Applied loads, gravity loads, temperature sets,
enforced displacements, etc., define the new loading conditions. The differences from the previous
case are divided by NINC to define the incremental values.  In cases of static analysis (DT =0.0) using
arc-length methods, NINC is used to  determine the initial arc -length for the subcase, and the number
of load subdivisions will not be equal to NINC. In cases of creep analysis (DT &amp;gt;0.0), NINC is the
number of time step increments.
3.For creep analysis, t he unit of DT must be consistent with the unit used on the CREEP entry that
defines the creep characteristics.  Total creep time for the subcase or step is DT multiplied by the value
in the field NINC; i.e., DT*NINC. For SOL 400  with advanced nonlinear elements (elements with
PSLDN1, PSHLN1, etc.) for creep analysis, if the total time does not equal 1.0, then the NLSTEP
Bulk Data entry must be used. EPSW Error tolerance for work (W) criterion. See Remarks 4., 16., 17. and 19. (Real &amp;gt;0.0;
Default =1.0E-2)
MAXDIV Limit on probable divergence conditions per iteration before the solution is assumed to
diverge.  See Remark 9. (Integer 0; Default =3)
MAXQN Maximum number of quasi -Newton correction vectors to be saved on the database.  See
Remark 10. (Integer &amp;gt;0; Default =MAXITER for all methods except PFNT. For
PFNT, Default = 0)
MAXLS Maximum number of line searches allowed for each iteration.  See Remark 11.
(Integer &amp;gt;0; Default =4 for all methods except PFNT . For PFNT, Default = 0)
FSTRESS Fraction of effective stress  used to limit the subincrement size in the material
routines. See Remark 12. (0.0 &amp;lt;Real &amp;lt;1.0; Default =0.2)
LSTOL Line search tolerance. See Remark 12. (0.01 &amp;lt;Real &amp;lt;0.9; Default =0.5)
MAXBIS Maximum number of bisections allowed for each load increment.  See Remark 13. (-
10&amp;lt;MAXBIS &amp;lt;10; Default =5 except for MAXITER &amp;lt; 0; Default = 0 if MAXITER
&amp;lt; 0)
MAXR Maximum ratio for the adjusted arc -length increment relative to the initial value.  See
Remark 14. (1.0 &amp;lt;MAXR &amp;lt;40.0; Default =20.0)
RTOLB Maximum value of incremental rotation (in degrees) allowed per iteration to activate
bisection.  See Remark 15. (Real &amp;gt;2.0; Default =20.0)
MINITER Minimum number of iterations for each increment, SOL 101 with contact and SOL
400 only. (Integer &amp;gt; 0; Default = 1; In contact analysis, Default = 2) When high accuracy
is required, it is also recommended to set MINITER = 2.Describer Meaning

Main Index
4.The stiffness update strategy is selected in the KMETHOD field.
•If the AUTO option is selected, the program automatically selects the most efficient strategy based
on convergence rates. At each step the number of iterations required to converge is estimated.
Stiffness is updated, if (i) estimated number of iterations to converge exceeds MAXITER, (ii)
estimated time required for convergence with current stiffness exceeds the estimated time required
for convergence with updated stiffness, and (iii) solution diverges. See Remarks 9. and 13. for
diverging solutions.
•If the SEMI option is selected, the program for each load increment (i) performs a single iteration
based upon the new load, (ii) updates the stiffness matrix, and (iii) resumes the normal AUTO
option.
•If the ITER option is selected, the program updates the stiffness matrix at every KSTEP iterations
and on convergence if KSTEP &amp;lt;MAXITER.  However, if KSTEP &amp;gt;MAXITER, stiffness matrix
is never updated.  Note that the modified Newton -Raphson iteration method is obtained by
selecting the ITER option and KSTEP =MAXITER. The &amp;ldquo;U&amp;rdquo; convergence test is not used if
ITER-1 is selected.
•If the FNT option is selected, the program will use the full Newton iteration method for which
the stiffness matrix will be updated at every iteration. FNT option is available for SOL 400  only.
For SOL 106, please use “KMETHOD=ITER and KSTEP=1” instead. In comparison with the
PFNT method, the defaults for FNT are EPSU=0.01, EPSW=0.01 and MAXLS=4. See
Remark 18.
•If the PFNT option is selected, the program will use the Pure Full Newton iteration method. The
PFNT method is the same as the FNT method except that the defaults for PFNT method are
internally set as EPSU=-0.01, EPSW=-0.01, and MAXLS=0. The PFNT method is available for
SOL 400  only. See Remark 18.
5.For AUTO and SEMI options, the stiffness matrix is updated on convergence if KSTEP is less than
the number of iterations that were required for convergence with the current stiffness.
6.The number of iterations for a load increment is limited to MAXITER.  If the solution does not
converge in MAXITER iterations, the load increment is bisected and the analysis is repeated.  If the
load increment cannot be bisected (i.e., MAXBIS is attained or MAXBIS =0) and MAXDIV is
positive, the best attainable solution is computed and the analysis is  continued to the next load
increment.  One best solution is computed for SOL 106 and 4 best solutions are computed for
SOL 400. The analysis is terminated if the solution still diverges. If MAXDIV is negative, the analysis
is terminated immediately.
For SOL 400  only, MAXITER can be negative. If MAXITER is negative, the solution is continued
to the end of the current step, even if the solution is divergent. In this case, the best attainable solution
is computed for each load increment. The default for MAXBIS = 0, if MAXITER &amp;lt; 0. Also, for SOL
400, the value of MAXITER for the AUTO method is an approximation. The program will try to
obtain a converged solution if it senses the solution can converge.
7.The test flags (U =displacement error, P =load equilibrium error, W =work error, V = vector
component method, N = length method, and A = auto switch) and the tolerances (EPSU, EPSP, and
EPSW) define the convergence criteria.  All the requested criteria (combination of U,  P, W, V and/or
N) are satisfied upon convergence.  For SOL 400 , if the U criterion is selected together with P or W,&lt;/p&gt;

Parameters for Nonlinear Static Analysis Control2328
Main Index
then for the first iteration of a load increment, the U criterion will not be checked. For SOL 400 if
CONV = ‘blank’ the code will use a default of “UPW” if no contact analysis and “PV” if a contact
analysis is performed.  See the MSC Nastran Handbook for Nonlinear Analysis for more details on
convergence criteria. For V and N, see Remark 20. For A, see Remark 21.
8.INTOUT controls the output requests for displacements, element forces and stresses, etc.  YES or
ALL must be specified in order to be able to perform a subsequent restart from the middle of a
subcase.
•For the Newton family of iteration methods (i.e., when no NLPCI command is specified), the
option ALL is equivalent to option YES since the computed load increment is always equal to the
user-specified load increment.
•For SOL 400  only, if the adaptive time stepping scheme is used (i.e., when a NLA DAPT B ulk
Data entry with the same ID is specified), INTOUT is allowed to be Integer &amp;gt; 0. In this case, the
load step is divided into INTOUT increments for output. For example, if INTOUT=5, the
output will be at load increments 0.2, 04, 0.6, 08, and 1.0. Please note that INTOUT defines
only the output load increments, which are different from the analysis increments. The analysis
load increment size is smaller than or equal to the output load increment size.
•For arc -length methods (i.e., when the NLPCI command is specified) the computed load
increment in general is not going to be equal to the user -specified load increment, and is  not
known in advance. The option ALL allows the user to obtain solutions at the desired intermediate
load increments.
9.The ratio of energy errors before and after the iteration is defined as divergence rate , i.e.,
Depending on the divergence rate, the number of diverging iteration (NDIV) is incremented as
follows:
If  or , then NDIV = NDIV + 2
If , then NDIV = NDIV + 1INTOUT Output Processed
YES For every computed load increment.
NO For the last load of the subcase or step.
ALL For every computed and user -specified load increment.

The solution is assumed to diverge when NDIV &amp;gt;|MAXDIV|.  If the solution diverges and the load
increment cannot be further bisected (i.e., MAXBIS is attained or MAXBIS is zero), the stiffness is
updated based on the previous iteration and the analysis is continued.  If the solution diverges again
in the same load increment while MAXDIV is positive, the best solution is computed and the analysis
is continued to the next load increment.  If MAXDIV is negative, the analysis is terminated on the
second divergence.
10. The BFGS update is  performed if MAXQN &amp;gt;0.  As many as MAXQN quasi-Newton vectors can be
accumulated.  The BFGS update with these QN vectors provides a secant modulus in the search
direction.  If MAXQN is reached, no additional ON vectors will be accumulated.  Accumulated QN
vectors are purged when the stiffness is updated and the accumulation is resumed.
11. The line search is performed as required, if MAXLS &amp;gt;0.  In the line search, the displacement
increment is scaled to minimize the energy error.  The line search is  not performed if the absolute
value of the relative energy error is less than the value specified in LSTOL.
12. The number of subincrements in the material routines (elastoplastic and creep) is determined so that
the subincrement size is approximately  (equivalent stress).  FSTRESS is also used to
establish a tolerance for error correction in the elastoplastic material; i.e.,
error in yield function &amp;lt;
If the limit is exceeded at the converging state, the program will exit with a fatal message.  Otherwise,
the stress state is  adjusted to the current yield surface.
13. The number of bisections for a load increment/arc -length is limited to the absolute value of MAXBIS.&lt;br&gt;
Different actions are taken when the solution diverges depending on the sign of MAXBIS.  If
MAXBIS is positive, the stiffness is updated on the first divergence, and the load is bisected on the
second divergence.  If MAXBIS is negative, the load is bisected every time the solution diverges until
the limit on bisection is reached.  If the solution does not converge after |MAXBIS| bisections, the
analysis is continued or terminated depending on the sign of MAXDIV.  See Remark 9.
14. MAXR is used in the adaptive load increment/arc -length method to define the overall upper and
lower bounds on the load increment/arc -length in the subcase; i.e.,
where  is the arc -length at step n and  is the original arc-length.  The arc-length method for
load increments is selected by an NLPCI Bulk Data entry.  This entry must have the same ID as the
NLPARM Bulk Data entry.
15. The bisection is activated if the incremental rotation for any degree-of-freedom
exceeds the value specified by RTOLB.  This bisection strategy is based on the
incremental rotation and controlled by MAXBIS.
16. The default for NINC is 10, except if there is a GAP, Line Contact, Heat Transfer or
PARAM,NLTOL,0, in which case the default is 1. Default tolerance sets are determined based on
model type and desired accuracy. Accuracy is under user control and can be specified on the PARAM,
NLTOL entry. For SOL 106, NLTOL’s value is used only if the CONV, EPSU, EPSP and EPSW FSTRESS

17. The method to compute the energy (work) error is different for SOL 106 and SOL 400. For
SOL 106, the energy error is computed based on the residue forces. While, for SOL 400 , the energy
error computed is the total energy error, which is based on the nonlinear forces acting on the
structure. At the start of the iteration, these two methods give approximately the same value.
However, near convergence, the SOL 106 method will field a much smaller value than that provided
by the SOL 400 method. The difference in these two methods is reflected in the default values shown
in Remark 16. The reason for a new method used in SOL 400  is that it gives the true error of the
physical energy. On the other hand, the error computed in SOL 106 has no counter part in the
physical world.
18. For FNT and PFNT methods, whether the stiffness matrix will be updated between the convergence
of a load increment and the start of the next load increment depends on the value of KSTEP. In this
case, KSTEP = -1, ‘BLANK’, or 1. A user fatal error will be issued if other value is input. If KSTEP
= -1, the stiffness matrix will not be updated. If KSTEP = ‘BLANK’, the program will decide whether
to update depending element type. If KSTEP = 1, the stiffness matrix will be forced to be updated.
19. If EPSU &amp;gt; 0.0, the displacement error is computed with respect to the total displacements. If EPSU
&amp;lt; 0.0, the displacement error is computed with respect to the delta displacements of a load increment.
If EPSW &amp;gt; 0.0, the energy error is computed with respect to the total energy. If EPSW &amp;lt; 0.0, the
energy error is computed with respect to the delta energy of a load increment. The options EPSU &amp;lt;
0.0 and EPSW &amp;lt; 0.0 are available for SOL 400  only.
20. V and N are additional methods for convergence checking using the displacement (U) and/or load
(P) criteria. V stands for vector component checking. In this method, convergence checking is
performed on the maximum vector component of all components in the model. N stands for length
checking. In this method, the length of a vector at a grid point is first computed by the SRSS (square
root of the sum of the squares) method. Then convergence checking is performed on the maximum
length of all grid points in the model. For example, if CONV=UV, then V checking method will be
performed with the U criteria, i.e., the maximum displacement component of all displacement
components in the model is used for convergence checking. For V and N, the EPSU is always
negative, i.e., the error is computed with respect to the delta displacements of a load increment, even
if positive value is requested by users. CONV=V is the same as CONV=UPV. If both V and N are
specified; V will take precedence over N. For example, CONV=VN is the same as CONV=V.
By default, for UPV or UPN, separate checks are made over force and moment vectors, and
translation and rotation vectors. While the force/translation check is valid always, the moment or
rotation check is only valid for 6 DOF elements (beams, shells, etc.). In certain cases (i.e., simply
supported or hinged structures where moments are numerically small, small rotation problems), it
may be beneficial to turn off the additional convergence testing done for moments and/or rotations. Table 25  Default Tolerances for Static Nonlinear SOL 400 Models With Gaps or

21. For SOL 400 , the convergence checking flag “A” is implemented. “A” means automatically switching
to an appropriate convergence checking flag if an unappropriated one is selected for a particular
problem. For example, for the problem of stress-free contact analysis, the convergence checking flag
PV is inappropriate because this may result of zero divided by zero in convergence checking
computation. In this case, PV is switched to UV automatically if A is selected and the residual force
is small, i.e., . The legal combinations for A and PA, UA, WA, PVA, UVA, PNA,
and UNA. The rules for auto-switching are that P is switched to U, U is switched to P, and W is
switched to UP. For example, , , etc. For all other combinations,
the A selection is ignored, for example, UPA is the same as UP.
22. For SOL 101 contact , NLPARM can be used to control nonlinear solution process, such as the
number of load increments. Since the only source of nonlinearity comes from contact, some fields,
however, are neither relevant to the iterative solution nor considered as user-controllable. These fields
include DT(=0.0), KMETHOD(=AUTO), KSTEP(=500), INTOUT(=NO) and MAXLS(=0).
NLPARM is not required for running SOL 101 contact jobs. If it is not provided by the user, Nastran
will create one. All the values of its fields are printed in F06 file under N O N - L I N E A R   I T E

Parameters for Arc -Length Methods in Nonlinear Static Analysis
Main Index
Defines a set of parameters for the arc-length incremental solution strategies in nonlinear static analysis (SOL
106 and SOL 400).  This entry will be used if a subcase contains an NLPARM command (NLPARM =ID).
Format:
Example:
Remarks:
1.The NLPCI entry is  selected by the Case Control command NLPARM =ID. There must also be an
NLPARM entry with the same ID. However, for creep analysis (DT ≠0.0 in NLPARM entry), the
arc-length methods cannot be activated, and the NLPCI entry is ignored if specified. The NLPCI
entry is not recommended for heat transfer analysis in SOL 153.
Please note:
a.The ARCLN method is supported in permanent glue contact analysis.
b.The ARCLN method is not supported in general contact analysis.
c.The ARC LN method should not be used with SPCD or SPCR

TYPE = “RIKS”:
TYPE = “MRIKS”:
where:
The constraint equation has a disparity in the dimension by mixing the displacements with the load
factor.  The scaling factor (w) is introduced as user input so that the user can make constraint equation
unit-dependent by a proper scaling of the load factor . As the value of w is increased, the constraint
equation is  gradually dominated by the load term. In the limiting case of infinite w, the arc -length
method is degenerated to the conventional Newton’s method.
3.The MINALR and MAXALR fields are used to limit the adjustment of the arc -length from one load
increment to the next by:
The arc -length adjustment is based on the convergence rate (i.e., number of iterations required for
convergence) and the change in stiffness.  For constant arc -length during analysis, use
MINALR =MAXALR =1.
4.The arc -length l for the variable arc -length strategy is adjusted based on the number of iterations
that were required for convergence in the previous load increment (Imax)and the number of iterations
desired for convergence in the current load increment (DESITER) as follows:
5.The MXINC field is used to limit the number of controlled increment steps in case the solution never
reaches the specified load.  This field is useful in limiting the number of increments computed for a
collapse analysis.uniun0–

Remarks:
1.NLRGAP must be selected with the Case Control command NONLINEAR =SID.
2.Multiple NLRGAP entries with the same SID are allowed.
3.The NLRGAP is not an element, but a nonlinear load similar to the NOLINi Bulk Data entries.  It
computes the relative displacements of GA and GB in the selected plane and applies appropriate
nonlinear loads to simulate the radial contact.NLRGAP Nonlinear Load Proportional to Gap

4.The degrees-of-freedom in the XY, YZ, or ZX planes (depending on the PLANE) of GA and GB must
be members of the solution set. This means the e -set for modal formulation and the d -set for direct
formulation. If RADIUS is &amp;gt; 0.0, then the in -plane rotation degree-of-freedom must also be in the
solution set.
5.The NLRGAP is limited to use in direct transient or nonlinear harmonic response solution sequences.
When enforced motion is used, the NLRGAP requires that PARAM,ENFMETH,ABS be specified
because the generated loads are a function of total displacement and not relative displacement.
6.The XY, YZ and ZX planes are relative to the displacement coordinates systems of GA and GB.
In order to ensure correct results, points GA and GB must satisfy the following three conditions:
a.They must both be grid points
b.They must be coincident
c.They must have parallel displacement coordinate systems
The program checks for the above conditions. If they are not satisfied, the program terminates the
execution with an appropriate fatal message. The coincident check can be skipped by specifying
system(648)=1. The default is 0.
7.The shaft radius is used only for the computation of friction induced torque.
8.In the underlying equations, a positive coefficient of friction is consistent with counter -clockwise
shaft rotation from axis 1 towards axis 2 (anti -clockwise). A negative coefficient of friction is
consistent with clockwise shaft rotation from axis 2 towards axis 1 (clockwise). See Figure 9-102.
9.Nonlinear forces for the grids referenced on the NLRGAP can be output with the NLLOAD Case
Control command. See Figure 9-102 for the sign conventions .&lt;/p&gt;

10. The time step algorithm in transient solution sequences may loose unconditional stability when this
load entry is used. In most practical cases, the time step size chosen to reach a certain accuracy is below
the stability limit. It is recommended to decrease the time step if results diverge. Additional
recommendations are outlined in the user guides.
11. TABK may reference either a TABLED1 ID or a TABLED5 ID.
For transient response, only a TABLED1 entry may be referenced. There are two possible scenarios:
a.The number entered in the TABK field is a positive integer. In this case the integer references a
TABLED1 entry defining pairs of time vs. gap stiffness.
b.The number entered in the TABK field is a negative integer. In this case the absolute value of the
integer references a TABLED1 entry defining pairs of gap penetration vs. gap force.
For nonlinear harmonic response either a TABLED1 entry or a TABLED5 entry may be referenced
leading to three possible scenarios:
a.The number entered in the TABK field is a positive integer referencing a TABLED1 entry. In this
case, the pairs of values defined on the TABLED1 entry are frequency vs. gap stiffness.
b.The number entered in the TABK field is a negative integer, the absolute value of which references
a TABLED1 entry. In this case, the pairs of values defined on the TABLED entry are gap
penetration vs. gap force.Grid A12

12. Forces due to TABK and TABU at GA and GB are only present when the gap is closed. A moment
is applied only when the gap is closed and RADIUS &amp;gt; 0.0.
13. Smoothing function feature is supported only for SOL128 solution. Refer MSC Nastran
Rotordynamics User’s Guide  for details on smoothing function calculations and example.
14. GAMMA is a new option to specify the flag to use smoothing function option for NLRGAP element.
15. SMVAL is the smoothing function value to be used. It is recommended to use a value of 1.0E+06.

CTRLDEF This Keyword is applicable in SOL101 static contact analysis or in SOL400 nonlinear
static  and transient analysis.
For SOL400,  the values &amp;ldquo;QLINEAR&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;MILDLY&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;SEVERELY&amp;rdquo;  are available
along with the option of leaving blank. See Remark 10. for detail description of these
three keyword options and the  blank option.
For SOL101, the values &amp;ldquo;LCPERF&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;LCACCU&amp;rdquo; are available along with the option
of leaving blank. See Remark 11. for detail description of these two keyword options. If
left blank the values as described under the &amp;ldquo;LCNT&amp;rdquo; keyword entry will be used.
If SOL400 keyword values are present in a SOL101 static contact analysis run or
SOL101 keyword values are present in a SOL400 nonlinear static  run, the keywords are
ignored.
In SOL400 nonlinear transient analysis, the use of keywords &amp;ldquo;QLINEAR&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;MILDLY&amp;rdquo;,
and &amp;ldquo;SEVERELY&amp;rdquo;  or blank cannot  properly set a &amp;ldquo;FIXED&amp;rdquo; NINC value or an&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;ADAPT&amp;rdquo; DTINITF value so the user still must  set whichever one of these keyword
entries value is relevant for a transient run .
“GENERAL” Keyword for parameters used for overall analysis.
MAXITER Maximum number of iterations allowed for each increment. See Remark 6. (Integer;
Default = 10)
MINITER Minimum number of iterations needed for each increment. (Integer &amp;gt;0; Default = 1) In
contact analysis or CTRLDEF = SEVERELY, Default = 2). When high accuracy is
required, it is also recommended to set MINITER = 2.

13. for more information.
CREEP This flag allows the activation of creep for a particular step. Note: the permanent creep
flag specified through the NLMOPTS, CREEP option should also be flagged for the
activation. If set to 1, creep will be used; if set to 0, creep will not be used (even if creep
data has been defined for a material using MATVP). (Integer 0 or 1; Default = 0).
Adaptive load stepping based upon creep can be flagged using CRITTID below. For
enhanced nonlinear elements only.
“FIXED” Keyword to indicate that fixed time stepping is to be used. See Remark 1.
NINC Number of increments for fixed time stepping. (Integer &amp;gt; 0; Default =50). The time step

Remarks:
1.The target elements are the elements defined in the follow-up run and are the elements that will be
initialized using the import archive.
2.Both defined and imported Euler elements need to be orthogonal in the global system.
3.MESH-ID enables support for multiple Euler domains. If MESH-ID is not set the import archive
will be mapped onto all Euler elements.
4.For multi-material Euler analyses with multiple Eulerian materials all material variables in the import
archive require the material number. These material variables are MASS, DENSITY, SIE, FMAT.
The required list of variables for a MMHYDRO run are: MASSXX, SIEXX, FMATXX, XVEL,
YVEL, ZVEL. Here XX denotes the material number. FOR MMSTREN the variables TXX, TYY,
TZZ, TXY, TYZ, TZX, EFFPLS have to be added. If the multi-material run uses only one Eulerian
material then the material numbers can be left out.
5.For multi-material Euler analyses with EOSIG , the following has to be added for the IG materials:
MASS-EXX, MASS-PXX, RHO-EXX, RHO-PXX, IGBURNXX, FMAT-PXX, FMAT-PXX, SIE-
EXX, and SIE-PXX. Here XX denotes the material number
6.For the single-material Hydro Euler solver the required list is MASS, DENSITY, SIE, FMAT, and
FVUNC.
7.IF FVUNC is not included in the Import archive it is assumed that all elements in this archive are
fully uncovered. It is allowed to import such an archive in a simulation with a coupling surface. In
this follow up simulation the target elements can have uncover fractions different from one. In this
case conservative quantities of imported elements are reduced by the uncover fraction of the target
element. This is to avoid unwanted pressure increases. It simply means that any mass of the import
archive that is located in the covered part of the target elements is thrown away. As a result not all
mass in the import archive is mapped to the target elements. How much of the mass of the import
archive is mapped is shown in the out file.
8.In the OUT file, a summary is shown of all variables that are mapped.
9.In the follow-up run, the cycle and time are taken from the import archive. The results of the first
cycle of the follow-up run are determined from remapping only and has not gone through an equation
of state yet. This will happen in the next cycle
10. If needed the remapping can be checked by doing only one additional cycle in the follow-up run with
a quite small time step. Then, the follow-up OUT file shows two cycles and the results should be
almost identical to the results of the import archive. Also, material summaries in the OUT file
between first run and follow-up run should be identical. The only exceptions are the summaries of
momentum, kinetic energy, and total energy per material. For these three quantities, only the total
amounts will remain constant between first and follow-up run.Describer Meaning
filename The filename of the ARC file to be used.
CYCLE Cycle number.
MESH-ID The MESH ID of the target elements.&lt;/p&gt;

1.Note that the following applies:
a.Only one of LCNT, FIXED, ADAPT  or A RCLN  time/load stepping scheme can be used on a
specific NLSTEP entry.
Note that only LCNT may be used in SOL 101. If other selection of load stepping scheme is used,
it will be ignored, and the default value of LCNT will be applied
b.FIXED or ADAPT may be used for a single physics STEP or for a coupled physics
STEP/SUBSTEP.
c.If no LCNT, FIXED, ADAPT,  or ARCLN  appear on a NLSTEP entry , then the default is
FIXED with 50 increments.
d.The ARCLN method is supported in permanent glue contact analysis.
e.The ARCLN method is not supported in general contact analysis.
f.The ARCLN method should not be used with SPCD or SPCR.KMETHOD Method for controlling stiffness updates. (Character =“PFNT or “ITER”; Default =

when CONV is set to UV, UN, PV, PN, UPV or UPN: (Integer; Default =3)
0 check on forces, moments, displacements and rotations
1 check on forces, moments and displacements
2 check on forces, displacements and rotations
3 check on forces and displacements
If there is no V and N in the CONV, MRCONV is ignored and all translational and
rotational quantities are used to compute the convergence criteria.

g.The ARCLN method should not be used in transient dynamic analysis.
h.The ARCLN method should not be used in conjunction with HEAT or COUP.
i.The ARCLN method cannot be used with the Intel MKL PARDISO solver .
j.The LCNT keyword can only be used in a SOL 101 static analysis.
2.The desired number of recycles (NDESIR) can be used in static mechanical, dynamic mechanical (see
Remark 16) and heat transfer.
3.In coupled analysis, the time step change is calculated separately for heat and mechanical and the
smallest of the two is used.
4.When the time step is increased due to desired number of recycles, the previous time step is multiplied
with SFACT. When the time step is decreased the factor is calculated internally based upon the
minimum time step.
5.User criteria can be given in the TABSCTL entry via CRITTID. These criteria include rotation,
displacements, stresses, strains, creep strains. The time step is decreased if the current value of the
value is larger than the user specified limit. If LIMTAR is equal to 1 (“target”) it also increases the
time step for the next increment if the current value is smaller than the target value given.
User criteria are generally useful for explicit creep analysis with adaptive time
stepping. The two recommended criteria in this case would be:
(i)Normalized creep strain increment &amp;lt; 0.5
(ii)Normalized stress change increment &amp;lt; 0.1
6.If MAXITER is given a negative value and the MAXITER number of iterations are obtained,
convergence is assumed and the analysis will continue with the next increment.
7.The “ARCLN ” entry is applicable to “MECH ” analysis only and is ignored for creep analysis. The&lt;br&gt;
available constraint types are as follows.

where:
w=user specified scaling factor (SCALEA)
=load factor
l=the arc-length
The constraint equation has a disparity in the dimension by mixing the displacements with the load
factor. The scaling factor  is introduced as user input so that the user can make constraint
equation unit-dependent by a proper scaling of the load factor (). As the value of is increased, the
constraint equation is gradually dominated by the load term. In the limiting case of infinite, the arc-
length method is degenerated to the conventional Newton’s method
8.The MINALR and MAXALR fields are used to limit the adjustment of the arc-length from one
increment to the next by:
MINALR &amp;lt;  &amp;lt; MAXALR
The arc-length adjustment is based on the convergence rate (i.e., number of iterations required for&lt;br&gt;
convergence) and the change in stiffness. For constant arc-length during analysis, use:
MINALR = MAXALR = 1
9.The arc-length l for the variable arc-length strategy is adjusted based on the number of iterations that
were required for convergence in the previous increment (Imax) and the number of iterations desired
for convergence in the current increment (NDESIRA) as follows:

10. In SOL 400, CTRLDEF entry is only valid for &amp;ldquo;MECH&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;HEAT&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;COUP&amp;rdquo;.  The description
and default of each option is listed below.
11. “LCPERF” specifies the performance preference during analysis, while &amp;ldquo;LCACCU&amp;rdquo; prefers accuracy
for analysis. These keywords must be defined if the smart contact in SOL 101 default is required.
Specification of LCNT keyword is optional. Listed below are default control parameters of contact in
SOL 101 i f LCNT keyword or some of its fields are not defined. If the CTRLDEF field is blank,
default control parameters will be same as those of NLPARM Bulk Data entry.
The default error tolerances EPSPC and EPSWC are relaxed for the accuracy preference LCACCU.
These relaxations are imperative to avoid convergence problems with an additional displacement
convergence criterion. The default control parameters are selected based on the test results of typical
contact  in SOL 101 m odels. Therefore, these empirical data are only served for the purpose of general
convenience. The users can customize any control parameters while performing their analysis.
For some contact models, specifying &amp;ldquo;LCPERF&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;LCACCU&amp;rdquo; preference may result in poor
convergence. In these cases, the user may increase the number of increments (NINCC) to achieve
optimal results.CTRLDEF Keyword to select the default setting of the control parameters. (Character = &amp;ldquo;QLINEAR&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;MILDLY&amp;rdquo;,

12. If  10 &amp;lt; MSTEP &amp;lt; 200 : activating frequency based adaptive time step adjustment with bounds (RB)
when specified increment (controlled by ADJUST) converges.  It cannot be combined with iteration
based adaptive time step adjustment, controlled by NDESIR, and NDESIR is always ignored in this
case. If MSTEP = -1: activating frequency based adaptive time step adjustment without bounds (RB).&lt;br&gt;
It can be combined with iteration based adaptive time step adjustment controlled by NDESIR. If
NDESIR=0, time step is only adjusted after the increment converges.
13. If MAXBIS is positive and the solution does not converge after MAXBIS bisections, the best solution
is computed and the analysis is continued to the next time step. If MAXBIS is negative and the
solution does not converge in |MAXBIS| bisection, the analysis is terminated.
14. SOL400 only support the displacement error computation with respect to the delta displacement of
a load increment for EPSU. Although a positive EPSU is assigned, internally it will be changed into
a negative value. If EPSW &amp;gt; 0.0, the energy error is computed with respect to the total energy. If
EPSW &amp;lt; 0.0, the energy error is computed with respect to the delta energy of a load increment.
15. The test flags (U =displacement error, P =load equilibrium error, W =work error, V = vector
component method, N = length method, and A = auto switch) and the tolerances (EPSU, EPSP, and
EPSW) define the convergence criteria.  All the requested criteria (combination of U,  P, W, V and/or
N) are satisfied upon convergence.  For SOL 400 , if the U criterion is selected together with P or W,
then for the first iteration of a load increment, the U criterion will not be checked. For SOL 400 if
CONV = &amp;lsquo;blank&amp;rsquo; the code will use a default of &amp;ldquo;UPW&amp;rdquo; if heat analysis and &amp;ldquo;PV&amp;rdquo; if a structural stress
analysis is performed . See the MSC Nastran Handbook for Nonlinear Analysis for more details on
convergence criteria. For V and N, see Remark 16. For A, see Remark 17.
16. V and N are additional methods for convergence checking using the displacement (U) and/or load
(P) criteria. V stands for vector component checking. In this method, convergence checking is
performed on the maximum vector component of all components in the model. N stands for length
checking. In this method, the length of a vector at a grid point is first computed by the SRSS (square
root of the sum of the squares) method. Then convergence checking is performed on the maximum
length of all grid points in the model. For example, if CONV=UV, then V checking method will be
performed with the U criteria, i.e., the maximum displacement component of all displacement
components in the model is used for convergence checking. For V and N, the EPSU is always
negative, i.e., the error is computed with respect to the delta displacements of a load increment, even
if positive value is requested by users. CONV=V is the same as CONV=UPV. If both V and N are
specified; V will take precedence over N. For example, CONV=VN is the same as CONV=V.
By default, for UPV or UPN, separate checks are made over force and moment vectors, and
translation and rotation vectors. While the force/translation check is valid always, the moment or
rotation check is only valid for 6 DOF elements (beams, shells, etc.). In certain cases (i.e., simply
supported or hinged structures where moments are numerically small, small rotation problems), it
may be beneficial to turn off the additional convergence testing done for moments and/or rotations.
17. For SOL 400 , the convergence checking flag “A” is implemented. “A” means automatically switching
to an appropriate convergence checking flag if an unappropriated one is selected for a particular
problem. For example, for the problem of stress-free contact analysis, the convergence checking flag
PV is inappropriate because this may result of zero divided by zero in convergence checking
computation. In this case, PV is switched to UV automatically if A is selected and the residual force&lt;/p&gt;

is small, i.e., PVA UVA . The legal combinations for A are PA, UA, WA, PVA, UVA, PNA, and
UNA. The rules for auto-switching are that P is switched to U, U is switched to P, and W is switched
to UP. For example, PVA UVA,  PVA UNA,  etc. For all other combinations, the A selection
is ignored, for example, UPA is the same as UP.
18. The stiffness update strategy is selected in the KMETHOD and KMETHODH field for mechanical
and thermal analysis, respectively.
•AUTO may be used for thermal analysis only. PFNT and ITER may be used in both
mechanical and thermal analysis.
•In the thermal analysis, if the AUTO option is selected, the program automatically selects the
most efficient strategy based on convergence rates. At each step the number of iterations
required to converge is estimated. Stiffness is updated, if (i) estimated number of iterations to
converge exceeds MAXITER, (ii) estimated time required for convergence with current stiffness
exceeds the estimated time required for convergence with updated stiffness, and (iii) solution
diverges. See Remarks 17. and 23. for diverging solutions. Available for the heat transfer pass
only.
•If the ITER option is selected, the program updates the stiffness matrix at every KSTEP
iterations and on convergence if KSTEP &amp;lt; MAXITER. However, if KSTEP &amp;gt; MAXITER,
stiffness matrix is never updated. Note that the modified Newton-Raphson iteration method is
obtained by selecting the ITER option and KSTEP = MAXITER.
•If the PFNT option is selected, the program will use the Pure Full Newton iteration method.
19. For FNT and PFNT methods, whether the stiffness matrix will be updated between the convergence
of a load increment and the start of the next load increment depends on the value of KSTEP. In this
case, KSTEP = -1, ‘BLANK’, or 1. A user fatal error will be issued if other value is input.
If KSTEP= 1, the stiffness matrix will not be updated. If KSTEP = ‘BLANK’, the program will decide
whether to update depending element type. If KSTEP = -1, the stiffness matrix will be forced to be
updated.
20. The ratio of energy errors before and after the iteration is defined as divergence rate , i.e.,
Depending on the divergence rate, the number of diverging iteration (NDIV) is incremented as
follows:
If  or , then NDIV = NDIV + 2
If , then NDIV = NDIV + 1Ei

Main Index
The solution is assumed to diverge when NDIV &amp;gt;|MAXDIVC|. If the solution diverges and the load
increment cannot be further bisected (i.e., MAXBIS is attained or MAXBIS is zero), the stiffness is
updated based on the previous iteration and the analysis is continued. If the solution diverges again
in the same load increment while MAXDIVC is positive, the best solution is computed and the
analysis is continued to the next load increment. If MAXDIVC is negative, the analysis is terminated
on the second divergence.
21. Please note that in NLTRAN analysis, the output is also influenced by NLPACK. For example, one
NLTRAN analysis has NLSTEP as:
NLSTEP,900,0.2
,fixed,2000,20
,mech,u
It has total 2000 increments, and asks output every 20 increments. Therefore, total output is 100 time
step. In NASTRAN, default value of NLPACK for NLTRAN is 100, in this model, therefore,
NASTRAN will write the results to OP2 after collecting 100 output, i.e., this model will write results
to OP2 only one time. With intermediate output request, only one OP2 file will be created.
If NLPACK=1, NASTRAN will write results to OP2 for every output request. In this model,
NASTRAN will write results to OP2 for every output request, i.e., writing 100 times in this model.
With &amp;ldquo;intermediate output request, 100 OP2 files will be created.
If NLPACK=2, NASTRAN will write results to OP2 for every two output requests. In this model,
NASTRAN will write results to OP2 for every two output request, i.e., writing 50 times in this model.
With “intermediate output request, 50 OP2 files will be created.
For NO of FIXED in NLSTEP, it is similar to INTOUT of ADAPT.
22. If Modules are present then this entry may only be specified in the main Bulk Data section.
23. NLSTEP entry does not work for creep analysis when using the traditional elements. In SOL 400,
NLPARM entry must be used to perform creep analysis with the traditional elements model.
24. Artificial damping takes effect in the following way with different options.
IDAMP=4: Artificial damping is always turned on. Both time stepping and added damping are
controlled through the step.
•A comparison of the incremental damping energy to the predicted incremental total strain
energy is used as a criterion for time step control.
•The damping factor to be used is computed based on the estimated damping energy and the
estimated total energy for the step.
IDAMP=5: Artificial damping is not turned on. Similar algorithm as IDAMP = 4 except that only
the time stepping is controlled based on the damping.
•A comparison of the incremental damping energy to the predicted incremental total strain
energy is used as a criterion for time step control.
IDMAP=6: When the time step reaches the minimum value and the analysis is going to stop
prematurely, two attempts are made to avoid a premature exit:
•The increment is repeated with a new time step = 10 tmin and quasi-static damping is added in
a manner similar to the IDAMP = 4 scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NLSTEP
Describes the Control Parameters for Mechanical, Thermal and Coupled Analysis in SOL 400 and for Contact Analysis in SOL 101.2356
Main Index
•If this does not work, the increment is repeated with a new time step = 100 tmin and the
process is repeated. Note that once damping is turned on to avoid the premature stop, it
remains on for the rest of the step .
25. IDAMP is a global parameter during a load step. It can&amp;rsquo;t be turn ON or OFF during a load step. For
NLRESTART job, IDAMP may be turn on if the restart job is starting from the beginning of a load
step, otherwise, IDAMP won&amp;rsquo;t be activated if the restart job starts in the middle of a load step.&lt;/p&gt;

Remarks:
1.If a set of grid points is referenced, the set must list only structural grid points.
2.If an element is assigned to a panel, it is recommended that all of its connections points belong to the
same panel.
3.If a set of elements is referenced, the set must list only structural elements. The panel will consist of
all grid points that are connection points of these elements.
4.If a set of property identifiers is referenced, the properties must be referenced by structural elements.
The panel will consist of all grid points that are connection points of elements referencing one of the
properties contained in the set.

Main Index
Specifies values for parameters used in solution sequences or user -written DMAP programs.
Format:
Example:
Remarks:
1.See Parameters  for a list of parameters used in solution sequences that may be set by the user on
PARAM entries.
2.If the large field entry format is used, the second physical entry line must be present, even though
fields 6 through 9 are blank except for SOL 700.
3.The first 8 characters of N must be unique. N with more than 8 characters is normally only used by
SOL 700.
4.If the Bulk Data involves the use of part superelements or external superelements, the following points
should be noted regarding the use of the PARAM Bulk Data entry:
a.PARAM entries specified in the Main Bulk Data portion of the input data apply only to the
residual and not to the part superelements or external superelements .
b.PARAM entries specified in the BEGIN SUPER portion of the Bulk Data for a part superelement
or an external superelement apply only to that superelement .PARAM Parameter

c.The most convenient way of ensuring that PARAM entries apply not only to the residual, but also
to all part superelements and external superelements is to specify such PARAM entries in Case
Control, not in the Main Bulk Data. This is particularly relevant for such PARAMs as POST.
5.If Modules are present then this entry may only be specified in the main Bulk Data section.&lt;/p&gt;

Remarks:
1.This entry is referenced by the CQUADX and CTRIAX entries.
2.The Y-axis of CID defines the axis of symmetry while its X-Y plane defines the two-dimensional plane
of the axisymmetric harmonic element. The X-axis of CID thus defines the radial direction.
3.The gyroscopic matrix is generated for the element only for the case of NHARM = 1 (the default).
4.The integration scheme INT selects the number of Gauss points used for matrix generation as
indicated below:
INT=0 uses INT=2 (no mid-side nodes) or INT=3 (mid-side nodes). The default INT=0 is
recommended. The use of INT=1 will produce a singular stiffness and is meant for experimental

6.The stress recovery coefficients C1 and C2, etc., are the y and z coordinates in the bar element
coordinate system of a point at which stresses are computed. Stresses are computed at both ends of
the bar. For conventional element, only bending components of strain and stress are outputted at
points C1 and C2, etc. Membrane components of strain and stress are outputted as axial value. For
advanced nonlinear element, the bending and membrane components of strain and stress are
superposed and outputted together at the points C1 and C2, etc., there is no axial value individually.
7.For response spectra analysis on stress recovery coefficients, the CBEAM element entry should be
used because bar element results will be inaccurate.
8.Figure 9-105 describes the PBAR element coordinate system.
where:
Figure 9-105  PBAR Element Coordinate System
9.For cross-sections that are not doubly symmetric, when a beam is loaded through the centroid, it may
in addition to bending undergo rotation. The CBAR element, by default, does not represent this
behavior because the shear center is not explicitly accounted for on a CBAR entry.
By definition, for the CBAR element, the load is applied at the centroid and not at the shear center.
If load application at the shear center is desired, appropriately applied offsets can be used on the
CBAR entry or the CBAR/PBAR element replaced by the CBEAM/PBEAM element which by
default explicitly applies the load through the shear center.
If warping considerations and bi-moment calculations are important, the CBEAM/PBEAM element
should be used.I1=

6.The GROUP is associated with an FMS CONNECT statement that specifies the evaluator. A
reserved GROUP name is “MSCBML0”. Users may create their own cross -section types. Each of the
types will require one or more subroutines to convert DIMi information to geometric property
information contained on a PBAR entry and optimization information. See Building and Using the
Sample Programs  in the MSC Nastran Utilities Guide  for a discussion on how to include a user-defined
beam library.
7.A function of this entry is to derive an equivalent PBAR entry. Any sorted echo request will also cause
printout and/or punch of the derived PBAR.
8.For GROUP =“MSCBML0”, the cross -sectional properties, shear flexibility factors, and stress
recovery points (C, D, E, and F) are computed using the TYPE and DIMi as shown in Figure 9-106
through Figure 9-109. The figures show the origin of the cross section, but the PBARL does not
account for differences between the shear center and the neutral axis and the properties are computed
relative to the neutral axis. This results in approximations for section types ‘I’, ‘CHAN’, ‘T’,
‘CHAN1’, ‘T1’, ‘CHAN2’, ‘T2’, ‘L’ and ‘BOX1’. The PBEAML provides a better representation of
section properties in these cases and is recommended.
The PBARL does not account for offsets between the neutral axis and the shear center. Therefore, the
CHAN, CHAN1 and CHAN2 cross -sections may produce incorrect results. The PBEAML is
recommended.
9.For DBOX section, the default value for DIM5 to DIM10 are based on the following rules:
a.DIM5, DIM6, DIM7 and DIM8 have a default value of DIM4 if not provided.
b.DIM9 and DIM10 have a default value of DIM6 if not provided.
10. The finite element formulation (FEF) utilized for arbitrary beam cross section is selected as the default
method for computing sectional properties for all supported cross section types of PBARL when
GROUP=MSCBML0. The original beam equations which are based on thin-walled assumptions can
be accessed via Bulk Data entry ‘MDLPRM,TWBRBML,1’. Thus the shear stiffness factors K1 and
K2 are calculated as in Remark 11. of the PBMSECT entry and the element will behave according to
the Timoshenko beam theory by default. Thus the resulting CBAR will have non-infinite K1/K2
shear flexibility factors, and therefore will not behave as a Bernoulli-Euler.
11. For optimization, individual DIMx of PBARL can be selected as designed properties even with the
finite element formulation.Note:   The above default value rules for DIM5 to DIM10 are not applicable to design
optimization property value update.&lt;/p&gt;

Beam Property (Alternate Form of PBEAM)2412
Main Index
Remarks:
1.PBCOMP is a primary property entry. Primary property entries are grouping entities for many
applications in MSC Nastran. Therefore it is highly recommended that the PBCOMP property
entries have unique identification numbers with respect to all other property entries else unexpected
grouping results may occur. There must be uniqueness between PBEAM, PBEAML, PBCOMP,
PBMSECT, PBEAM3 entries.
2.The second continuation entry may be repeated 18 more times. If SYMOPT = 5 a maximum of 21
continuation entries is allowed; i.e., a maximum of 20 lumped areas may be input. If SYMOPT = 1
through 4, the total number of areas input plus the total number generated by symmetry must not
exceed 20. If these are not specified, the program defaults, as usual, to the elliptically distributed eight
nonlinear rods. See Figure 9-110.Yi, Zi The (y,z) coordinates of the lumped areas in the element coordinate system. See Remark&lt;/p&gt;

3.For structural problems, MID and MIDi must reference a MAT1 material entry. For material
nonlinear analysis, the material should be perfectly plastic since the plastic hinge formulation is not
valid for strain hardening. For heat transfer problems, MID and MIDi must reference a MAT4 or
MAT5 material entry.
4.For the case where the user specifies I1, I2 and I12 on the parent entry, the stress -output location may
also be specified on continuation entries. The (y,z) coordinates specified on these entries will serve as
stress output locations with the corresponding Ci’s set to 0. Stress output is provided at the first four
lumped area locations only. If one of the symmetry options is used and fewer than four lumped areas
are input explicitly, the sequence of output locations in the imaged quadrants is shown in Figure 9-110.
For one specific example in the model shown in Remark 8. (Figure 9-111), output can be obtained at
points 1 and 2 and in the image points 3 and 4.
5.Blank fields for K1 and K2 are defaulted to 1.0. If a value of 0.0 is used for K1 and K2, the transverse
shear stiffness becomes rigid and the transverse shear flexibilities are set to 0.0.
6.The values  and  are computed based on the value of MID on the parent entry. MID is will
follow the same symmetry rules as Ci depending on the value of SYMOPT. If the MIDi field on a
continuation entry is blank, the value will  be that of MID on the parent entry. MIDi values may be
input on continuations without the corresponding Yi, Zi, and Ci values to allow different stress -strain
laws.
7.If the lumped cross-sectional areas are specified, fields I1, I2, and I12 will be ignored. These and other
modified values will be calculated based on the input data (Yi, Zi, Ci, MIDi) as follows:Notes:  Integration points (lumped area) are numbered 1 through 8.
User-specified points are denoted by  and the mirrored points are denoted by  .

where n is the number of lumped cross -sectional areas specified.
8.For a doubly symmetric section (SYMOPT =1), if the lumped areas are specified on either axis, the
symmetry option will double the areas. For example, for the section shown in Figure 9-111, points 2
and 4 are coincident and so are points 6 and 8. In such cases, it is recommended that users input the
value of area as half of the actual value at point 2 to obtain the desired effect.

Remarks:
1.For structural analysis, MID must reference a MAT1 material entry . The beam may be described by
any valid stress-strain law. A plastic hinge is not used for SOL 700; instead, a standard nonlinear
analysis is performed
2.For material nonlinear analysis, MID may also reference a MATS1 entry, but the material properties
must be defined as elastic-perfectly plastic; for example, H =0.0 on the MATS1 entry. Also, only one-
eighth of the length at each end of the element abides by material nonlinear law; i.e., the element is
modeled as a plastic hinge. Any other type of material property specification may yield inaccurate
results.
3.For heat transfer analysis, MID must reference a MAT4 or MAT5 material entry.
4.If no stress data at end A is to be recovered and a continuation with the SO field is specified, then the
first continuation entry, which contains the fields C1(A) through F2(A), may be omitted.
5.If SO is “YESA” or “NO”, the third continuation entry, which contains the fields C1 through F2,
must be omitted. If SO is “YES”, the continuation for Ci, Di,  Ei, and Fi must be the next entry. The
blank fields are defaulted to 0.0 on these continuations.
6.The rules for the continuations entries are:
•The second and third continuation entries, which contain fields SO through F2, may be repeated
nine more times for intermediate X/XB values for linear beam elements. The order of these
continuation pairs is independent of the X/XB value; however, one value of X/XB must be 1.0,
corresponding to end B. The intermediate stress output requests will be ignored in the nonlinear
solution sequences (SOLs 106 and 129).
•The value of X/XB must be unique among the stations of a PBEAM. Duplication of X/XB is not
permitted.
•The fourth and fifth continuation entries, which contain fields K1 through N2(B), are optional
and may be omitted if the default values are appropriate.
7.If any fields 4 through 9 are blank on the continuation with the value of X/XB =1.0, then the values
for A, I1, I2, I12, J and NSM are set to the values given for end A. For the continuations that have
intermediate values of X/XB between 0.0  and 1.0 and use the default option (any of the fields 4
through 9 are blank), a linear interpolation between the values at ends A and B is performed to obtain
the missing section properties.
8.Blank fields for K1, K2 are defaulted to 1.0. If a value of 0.0 is used for K1 and K2, the transverse
shear flexibilities are set to 0.0 and field G on the MAT1 entry selected by MID must be nonzero.M1(A), M2(A),

shear deformation. To neglect shear deformation (i.e., to obtain the Bernoulli-Euler beam theory),
the values of  and  should be set to 0.0.

Beam Cross -Section Property
Main Index
Remarks:
1.For structural problems, PBEAML entries must reference a MAT1 material entry.
2.PBEAML is a primary property entry. Primary property entries are grouping entities for many
applications in MSC Nastran. Therefore it is highly recommended that the PBEAML property entries
have unique identification numbers with respect to all other property entries else unexpected
grouping results may occur. There must be uniqueness between PBEAM, PBEAML, PBCOMP,
PBMSECT, PBEAM3 entries.
3.For heat -transfer problems, the MID must reference a MAT4 or MAT5 material entry.
4.See the PBEAM entry description for a discussion of beam -element geometry.
5.If any of the fields NSM(B), DIMi(B) are blank on the continuation entry for End B, the values are
set to the values given for end A. For the continuation entries that have values of X(j)/XB between
0.0 and 1.0 and use the default option (blank field), a linear interpolation between the values at ends
A and B is performed to obtain the missing field.
6.The GROUP is associated with a FMS CONNECT statement, which specifies the evaluator. A
reserved GROUP name is “MSCBML0”. Users may create their own cross -section types. Each of the
types will require a one or more subroutines to convert DIMi information to geometric property
information contained on a PBEAM entry. See Building and Using the Sample Programs  in the MSC
Nastran Utilities Guide  for a discussion of how to include a user-defined beam library.
7.For GROUP =“MSCBML0”, the cross -sectional properties, shear flexibility factors and stress
recovery points are computed using the TYPE and DIMi as shown in Figure 9-113. The element
coordinate system is located at the shear center.
8.A function of this entry is to derive an equivalent PBEAM entry. Any sorted echo request will also
cause printout and/or punch of the derived PBEAM.
9.Beams can have no more than 14 dimensions per station. The total number of dimensions at all
stations must be less than 200. The transfer of data with the beam server is limited to 4000 words.
None of these limits are exceeded with the MSC beam library, but a user defined beam library could.
10. The finite element formulation (FEF) utilized for the arbitrary beam cross section is selected as the
default method for computing sectional properties for all supported cross section types of PBEAML
when GROUP=MSCBML0. The original beam equations, which are based on thin-walled
assumption can be accessed via Bulk Data entry ‘MDLPRM,TWBRBML,1’.
11. For optimization, individual DIMx of PBEAML can be selected as designed properties even with
finite element formulation.NO No stresses or forces are recovered.

Beam Cross -Section Property2428
Main Index
12. The origin of the  and . coordinate system for the section types is at the shear center for
all element types when using the FEF. For section types ‘L’, ‘T’, ‘T1’, ‘T2’ and ‘HAT1’, no shear
center calculation is calculated with the original beam equations and the origins of these types are at
the locations specified in the following figures. For these sections types, this can result in a difference
in the stress recovery points and the neutral axis locations between the beam equations and the FEF.
The FEF results are considered more exact. For the remaining types with the beam equation, the shear
center is either computed or is obvious due to symmetry considerations.yelemzelem&lt;/p&gt;

2.During loading, the loading curve is applied to determine the force in the belt element. At unloading,
the unloading curve is shifted along the strain axis until it intersects the loading curve at the point
from which unloading commences. The unloading table is applied for unloading and reloading, until
the strain again exceeds the intersection point. Upon further loading, the loading table is applied. For
subsequent unloading, the sequence is repeated.
3.Belt elements are tension only elements.
4.Instantaneous slack of an element can also be initialized per element using the TICEL entry with the
keyword SLACK and a corresponding VALUE.&lt;/p&gt;

8.Normal buckling modes for beams with nonlinear extensions can be computed through the
ANALYSIS=BUCK step. The buckle modes can be evaluated through a linear perturbation step
about a linear or nonlinear prestressed state. The current limitation is that lateral buckling mode
computations (eg. Lateral-torsional buckling seen in compression flanges of open section beams) are

The integration is carried out over the cross section of the element.
6.If T is zero, a solid circular cross section of radius RM is assumed and FSI must be 1.
7.If the first format is used, third -order moments are neglected for the consistent mass matrix. These
moments are zero whenever the cross section of the beam is symmetric about both the r and z axes.
8.If the circular cross -sectional property entry format is used, the stress points are automatically located
at the points indicated in Figure 9-114.
9.Offset vectors are treated like rigid elements and are therefore subject to the same limitations.
Offset vectors are not affected by thermal loads.
The specification of offset vectors is not recommended in solution sequences that compute
differential stiffness because the offset vector remains parallel to its original orientation. (Differential
stiffness is computed in buckling analysis provided in SOLs 105 and 200; SOLs 101,103 and 107
through 112 with STATSUB; and also nonlinear analysis provided in SOLs 106, 129, 153, and 159

Main Index
For OP and CP:
BRP(id) =value(Integer &amp;gt; 0); points to the ID of a SET1 or SET3 that specifies a BRanch.
The rules for BRP are:
BRP must start from and/or end on OUTP.
Segment length, defined as distance between two neighboring points on
BRP or OUTP, is preferably to be longer than the segment thickness.
Closely spaced points creates denser mesh for the cross section and does
not increase accuracy of properties significantly.
T(id) =[value(Real &amp;gt; 0.0),PT=(pid1,pid2)]; specifies the thickness of a segment in
profile. PT=(pid1,pid2) defines the start and end points of line segment(s). The
rules for T(id) are:
For CP and OP, it is a requirement to have a T(id) without
PT=(pid1,pid2) to serve as a default thickness for all segments which do
not have its thickness specified. This requirement is valid even when the
thickness for every segment is specified.
pid1 and pid2 under PT=( ) do not need to be neighboring points of a
SET. However, pid1 and pid2 must hold its position as in SETx for
OUTP and/or BRP.
Same segment may be covered by different T(id). T(id) are processed
sequentially as specified. The thickness of the last T(id) for a segment is
used as the thickness of a segment. Use &amp;lsquo;PARAM,ARBMNOW,1&amp;rsquo; to
turn off segment property overwrite.
For CP, T(id) of segment that close the profile must have (pid1=ID of
last point in OUTP, pid2=ID of first point in OUTP). Note that, if
input for pid1 and pid2 are reversed, T(id) will cover all segments in
OUTP except the one that close the profile.
Core(id) =[PCID,PT=(pid1,pid2)]; specifies the composite layup for CORE part of
composite. PCID is the ID of a PCOMPi/PCOMPG Bulk Data entry.
PT=(pid1,pid2) defines the start and end points of line segment(s) which
utilizes PCID.
Core=PCID is acceptable input and is used as default which is
applicable to all segments that are not specifically defined with
Core(id).
Thickness continuity of a ply must be maintained.  Thickness change
from segment to segment is not allowed.
For CP, the closing segment should always use the default Core=pcid.
No ply should go over the profile line which is defined by OUTP and
BRP. If situation arises, split a ply into two in such a way the no ply go
over the profile line.&lt;/p&gt;

3.Stress data recovery points are selected automatically from all points of a PBMSECT with GS form.
The points with maximum and/or minimum coordinates in X and Y axes are more likely to be picked.
For PBMSECT with CP or OP form, the stress data recovery points are selected from points with
computed coordinates that actually encircle the profile. Similar to GS form, the points with extreme
coordinates are more likely to be selected.
4.Only the POINT entry ID should be listed under SET1 or SET3 entries which, in turn, are
referenced by OUTP, INP and BRP. In addition, the POINT entry for defining an arbitrary beam
cross section must have the CP and X3 fields left blank.

5.Current implementation of PBMSECT supports constant section beam only.
6.Note that keyword Core can be abbreviated as ‘C’. Similarly, keyword Layer can be abbreviated as ‘L’.Layer(id) =[PCID,SETID]; specifies the composite layup for additional Layer(s) that wraps
around Core. PCID is the ID of a PCOMP/PCOMPG Bulk Data entry.
SETID selects a SET1/SET3 with POINT IDs.
NSM =value(Real &amp;gt; 0.0), specifies non-structural mass per unit length.
(id) =integer (&amp;gt;0) identifies INP , BRP or T which is not required if a single entity
appears in the PBMSECT entry. For T , the T(id) can be used to identify the
particular thickness to be designed in SOL 200.

7.If Core and/or Layer appears in PBMSECT, the PBMSECT ID can not be referenced on CBEAM.
Instead, it should be referenced on CBEAM3. Note, however, that a CBEAM3 cannot be used with
any other of the above options except the Core and/or Layer option. The use of any other option
results in a FATAL. In addition, it is recommended that CBEAM3 referencing composite PBMSECT
has 3 nodes and 3 warping DOFs.&amp;rsquo;
8.If OUTM=arbid is utilized on PBMSECT, element connection, grid location, PSHELL and material
Bulk Data entries must be provided after ‘BEGIN ARBMODEL=arbid’.
9.Note that the ‘arbid’ used under ‘BEGIN ARBMODEL’ is considered global and can be referenced
by PBMSECT with OUTM=arbid in different ‘BEGIN SUPER’ Bulk Data Section for Part
Superelements (SE).
10. PBMSECT with Core or Layer must be utilized along with ‘PARAM,ARBMSTYP,TIMOSHEN’ in
the Bulk Data Section.
11. The entry computes, based on an internally generated finite element analysis using a 2D mesh of the

3.Stress data recovery points are selected automatically from all points of a PBRSECT with GS form.
The points with maximum and/or minimum coordinates in X1 and/or X2 axes are more likely to be
picked. For PBRSECT with CP or OP form, the stress data recovery points are selected from points
with computed coordinates that actually encircle the profile. Similar to GS form, the points with
extreme coordinates are more likely to be selected.
4.Only the POINT entry ID should be listed under SET1 or SET3 entries which, in turn, are
referenced by OUTP, INP and BRP. In addition, the POINT entry for defining an arbitrary beam
cross section must have the CP and X3 fields left blank.
5.See Remark 11. of the PBMSECT entry for the theory used to compute the cross-sectional properties.BRP(id) =value(Integer &amp;gt; 0); points to the ID of a SET1 or SET3 that specifies a BRanch.
The rules for BRP are:
BRP must start from and/or end on OUTP.
Segment length, defined as distance between two neighboring points
on BRP or OUTP, is preferably to be longer than the segment
thickness. Closely spaced points creates denser mesh for the cross
section and does not increase accuracy of properties significantly.
T(id) =[value(real &amp;gt; 0.0),PT=(pid1,pid2)]; specifies the thickness of a segment in
profile. PT=(pid1,pid2) defines the end points of a straight line segment. The
rules for T(id) are:
For CP and OP, it is a requirement to have a T(id) without
PT=(pid1,pid2) to serve as a default thickness for all segments which
do not have its thickness specified. This requirement is valid even when
the thickness for every segment is specified.
pid1 and pid2 under PT=( ) do not need to be neighboring points of a
SET. However, pid1 and pid2 must hold its position as in SETx for
OUTP and/or BRP.
Same segment may be covered by different T(id). T(id) are processed
sequentially as specified. The thickness of the last T(id) for a segment is
used as the thickness of a segment. Use &amp;lsquo;PARAM,ARBMNOW,1&amp;rsquo; to
turn off segment property overwrite.
For CP, T(id) of segment that close the profile must have (pid1=ID of
last point in OUTP, pid2=ID of first point in OUTP). Note that, if
input for pid1 and pid2 are reversed, T(id) will cover all segments in
OUTP except the one that close the profile.
NSM =value(Real &amp;gt; 0.0), specifies non-structural mass per unit length.
(id) =integer (&amp;gt;0) identifies INP , BRP or T which is not required if a single entity
appears in the PBRSECT entry. For T, the T(id) can be used to identify the
particular thickness to be designed in SOL 200.&lt;/p&gt;

Remarks:
1.A PBUSH2D with the same PID must exist. The values from the PBUSH2D will be used as the
nominal stiffness, damping, and mass. Linear statics, normal modes, reduction, and superelement
processing will use the nominal values. The values from the selectedTABLED1 entries will be used in
any frequency-dependent loop.
2.Any field left blank indicates that the associated stiffness, damping, or mass is not frequency-
dependent and the nominal values will be used for that term in the solution.

9.For upward compatibility, if ONLY GE1 is specified on a PBUSH entry and GEi, i = 2 – 6 are all
blank on the PBUSH entry, then the single structural damping GE1 is applied to all defined Ki for
the PBUSH entry. In this case, GEi, i = 2 - 6, blank is not equivalent to 0.0 but a special flag.
For any PBUSH entry that has any GEi, i = 2 – 6 numerically specified including a 0.0, the fields GEi
are all treated separately and any GEi, i =2 - 6 field with no entry specified is defaulted to 0.0.  In this
case, for any GEi, i = 2 – 6, blank is equivalent to 0.0 and the results are radically different from the
no GEi, i = 2- 6 specified as described above.
Thus for the entry :
The GE=.05 will be replicated to fields 5 through 9.

10. PBUSH is a primary property entry. Primary property entries are grouping entities for many
applications in MSC Nastran. Therefore it is highly recommended that the PBUSH property entries
have unique identification numbers with respect to all other property entries else unexpected
grouping results may occur. There must be uniqueness between PBUSH entries.
11. The CBUSH is a self-equilibrating element which means that for a CBUSH of finite length, its
translational stiffness terms couple with rotational stiffness for rotational degrees of freedom.
However, this coupling is dependent on the orientation of the CBUSH element. Thus there may be
times when no explicit rotational stiffness is specified along a direction for which translational stiffness
was specified that there is also no coupled rotational stiffness for that direction.
In modal analysis, a CBUSH of finite length having rotational degrees of freedom with no rotational
stiffness (coupled or explicit) and no associated mass on the grids may cause massless mechanisms. A
massless mechanism means the natural frequency for this rotational mode approaches the limit of zero
rotational stiffness divided by zero mass, which is an undefined quantity. If the elements lie along a
global coordinate axis, the mass term is identically zero, which leads to very large negative or positive
eigenvalues and is usually beyond any reasonable search region. If the elements are skewed from the
global axes, the eigenvalues may be computed at any value (including negative) because of the
indeterminacy caused by numerical truncation.
12. The thermal expansion for the CBUSH will be calculated if the user supplies the thermal expansion
coefficient ALPHA and TEMPERATURE(LOAD) is requested. See TEMPERTURE Case Control
command for thermal loading rules.  For a CBUSH with coincident grids, or a single grid, if COINL
is provided, the thermal expansion is always just along the element x-axis.
13. The mass properties are assumed located at the point defined by S (or S1, S2, S3 if OCID&amp;gt; -1) on
the CBUSH entry. They are assumed to be in the element coordinate system. Define =S for the case
OCID= -1 (default). See CBUSH entry. For the case OCID&amp;gt; -1, define rA, rB to be the vector from
grid GA to (S1,S2,S3) and from grid GB to (S1,S2,S3) respectively, then

Remarks:
1.For a linear spring K a default value of 0.0 is allowed by not specifying the K entry. For a linear
damper C a default value of 0.0 is allowed by not specifying the C entry. If any nonlinearity is
specified (SHOCKA, SPRING, DAMPER, GENER) K &amp;gt; 0 is required. If K is not provided in the
presence of any nonlinearity, the element will behave as a linear element.
2.The damping C and mass M are ignored in static solution sequences.
3.The parameters defined on the continuation entries are used in nonlinear solution sequences only.
4.The linear parameters K and C are used in all solution sequences unless parameters on continuation
entries are defined and a nonlinear solution sequence is used. Then, the parameters K and C are used
for initial values in the first iteration of the first load step and the parameters from continuation
entries overwrite the linear parameters thereafter. When SHOCKA, SPRING or GENER are
specified, K is overwritten. When SHOCKA, DAMPER or GENER is specified, C is overwritten.
5.PBUSH1D may only be referenced by CBUSH1D elements in the residual structure which do not
attach to omitted degrees-of-freedom.
6.The continuation entries SHOCKA, SPRING, DAMPER and GENER may be specified in any
order. If more than one continuation entry is defined, then the forces of SHOCKA, SPRING, etc.
are added. Multiple continuation entries of the same kind are not allowed, for example, multiple
SPRING continuation entries.

8.For TYPE = EQUAT, the equations for tension and compression can be different. If the
identification numbers for compression are left blank, it is assumed that the equation for tension is
also valid for compression.
9.PBUSH1D is a primary property entry. Primary property entries are grouping entities for many

10. The force output is:
Where items in red are always output for linear analysis. The Stress output is:
Where items in red are always output for linear analysis.
(Axial stress) = , (Axial strain) = .
In nonlinear dynamics, the element force is the sum of all springs and dampers.
In linear dynamic solution sequences, the damping forces are not included in the element force
output.
Failed status is not currently used.
11. While computing Single Point Forces of Constraint (SPCFORCES), the constraint relationships
exist in stiffness for linear spring. However, the nonlinear elements treat the constraints as loads on s-
set. As a result, the SPCFORCES results are different between linear and nonlinear elements.F O R C E S   I N   B U S H 1 D   E L E M E N T S   (C B U S H 1 D)&lt;/p&gt;

Remarks:
1.Either SQUEEZE or CROSS option can be used. Both options cannot be specified.  SQUEEZE
option will be supported only in SOL400. When SQUEEZE option is used, the squeeze film damper
model force calculation is invoked using all the entries specified.
2.The angular measurement is counterclockwise from the displacement x-axis for the XY plane, the y-
axis for the YZ plane, and the z-axis for the XZ plane.
3.Offsets are measured from GB relative to GA.  For example, if direction 2 is in the vertical direction
and a gravity load is placed on GA, OFFSET2 will be a positive value (GB ‘moves’ toward GA in the
positive direction 2).
4.PBUSH2D is a primary property entry. Primary property entries are grouping entities for many
applications in MSC Nastran. Therefore it is highly recommended that the PBUSH2D property
entries have unique identification numbers with respect to all other property entries else unexpected
grouping results may occur. There must be uniqueness between PBUSH2D entries.
5.PBUSH2D may be used in conjunction with THPAD obtained from ROMAC for rotordynamic
applications. Also see ELEMUDS  and THPAD  bulk data entries.
6.The template used for specifying matrices using cross entries is:

&lt;p&gt;2475 PBUSHT
Frequency Dependent or Nonlinear Force Deflection Spring and Damper Property
Main Index
Remarks:
1.The “K”, “B”, and “GE” fields are associated with same entries on the PBUSH entry.
2.PBUSHT may only be referenced by CBUSH elements in the residual structure which do not attach
to any omitted degrees-of-freedom of ASET and/or dependent DOFs of MPC/Rigid elements.
Otherwise, the solution is an approximation based on nominal properties.
3.For nonlinear analysis the nominal values are used at the beginning of the analysis to compute initial
loading of the CBUSH element and meaningful values should be supplied for stiffness. As the
nonlinear analysis proceeds, the user supplied load deflection curves are used to compute new stiffness
values. For frequency dependent modal frequency response the system modes are computed using the
nominal Ki values. The frequency -dependent values are used at every excitation frequency.
4.The “K”, “B”, “GE” or “KN” fields may be specified in any order.
5.The PBUSHT is used in SOL 108 and SOL 111 when any “K”, “B”, or “GE” is specified. It is used
in SOL 106, SOL 129 or SOL 400 when “KN” is specified. It is ignored in all other solution
sequences .
6.For upward compatibility, if ONLY TGEID1 is specified on a PBUSHT entry and TGEIDi,
i = 2 – 6 are all blank on the PBUSHT entry, then the single structural damping table is applied to
all defined GEi for the PBUSH entry. In this case, TGEIDi, i = 2 – 6, blank is not equivalent to 0
but a special flag.
A PBUSHT entry that has any TGEIDi, i = 2 – 6 numerically specified including a 0, all the fields
TGEIDi are then treated separately and any TGEIDi, i=2 - 6 field with no entry specified is defaulted
to a 0 value and the results are radically different from the no TGEIDi, i=2 – 6 specified as described
above.
Thus for the entry:
The GE table ID 3303002 will be replicated to fields 5 through 9. While: If OPTION = “ULTLD”then UPPER specifies an upper failure load.
If OPTION = “RELDIS” then UPPER specifies a maximum relative displacement before
failure.
FSRS Fuse Stiffness Retention Factor is a factor which scales the stiffness so that the stiffness
does not instantly drop to a zero value. (Real &amp;gt; 0.0; Default = 1.-5)
LRGR Specifies if large rotation is to occur at end A. (Integer &amp;gt; 0; Default = 0). See Remark 14.

Frequency Dependent or Nonlinear Force Deflection Spring and Damper Property2476
Main Index
The 0 in FIELD 5 of the above PBUSHT above negates table 3303002 being replicated, hence, fields
5 through 9 will not have any associated table lookup.
7.For nonlinear analysis, only the “KN” line and optionally its two continuation lines are used.
8.For frequency responses, only the “K”, “B” and/or “GE” fields are used.
9.The continuations entries to “KN” are optional.
10. When the FDC field specifies one of the optional radial or spherical rules, stiffness entries not
involved in the rule may still have their own independent force-deflection curves.
11. If FUSE=0, the remaining entries are ignored. If FUSE &amp;gt; 0, the “OPTION”, “UPPER”, and
“LOWER” fields must be specified.
12. UPPER &amp;gt; LOWER required.
13. The following relationships exists between FDC and DIR
14. LRGR = 0 (Default) the element coordinate system is rotated with the rotation of grid A for both the
CID and the V vector. LRGR = 1 will suppress large rotation at end A. The initial CID and the V
vector will remain unchanged. LRGR = 2 a mid-increment method is used to rotate the element
system for the V vector. LRGR = 2 is deactivated if CID is not blank. When CID is blank, LRGR =
2 is recommended for SOL400 when large rotations are present as the mid-increment method
“averages” the rotations at both ends of the CBUSH and allows rotation when end A might have a
rotational constraint.
15. When the fuse criteria is reached in one of the stiffness components, the entire element is assumed to
fail. The component stiffnesses are then computed to be  at initial failure.PBUSHT 3303000 K 33030001

Main Index
Remarks:
1.The default for MID2, &amp;hellip;, MIDn is the last defined MIDi. In the example above, MID1 is the default
for MID2, MID3, and MID4. The same logic applies to Ti.
2.At least one of the four values (MIDi, Ti, THETAi, SOUTi) must be present for a ply to exist. The
minimum number of plies is one.GE Damping coefficient. See Remarks 4. and 12. (Real; Default =0.0)
LAM Laminate Options. (Character or blank, Default =blank). See Remarks 13. and 14.
“Blank” All plies must be specified and all stiffness terms are developed.
“SYM” Only plies on one side of the element centerline are specified. The plies are
numbered starting with 1 for the bottom layer. If an odd number of plies are
desired, the center ply thickness (T1) should be half the actual thickness.
“MEM” All plies must be specified, but only membrane terms (MID1 on the derived
PSHELL entry) are computed.
“BEND” All plies must be specified, but only bending terms (MID2 on the derived
PSHELL entry) are computed.
“SMEAR” All plies must be specified, stacking sequence is ignored MID1=MID2 on the
derived PSHELL entry and MID3, MID4 and TS/T and 12I/T**3 terms are
set as blanks).
“SMCORE” All plies must be specified, with the last ply specifying core properties and the
previous plies specifying face sheet properties. The stiffness matrix is
computed by placing half the face sheet thicknesses above the core and the
other half below with the result that the laminate is symmetric about the mid-
plane of the core. Stacking sequence is ignored in calculating the face sheet
stiffness.
MIDi Material ID of the various plies. The plies are identified by serially numbering them from 1
at the bottom layer. The MIDs must refer to MAT1, MAT2, MAT8, or MATDIGI Bulk
Data entries. See Remarks 1. 15. and 16. For use with MAT4 and MAT5, see Remark  18.
(Integer &amp;gt;0 or blank, except MID1 must be specified.)
Ti Thicknesses of the various plies. See Remarks 1. (Real &amp;gt; 0.0 or blank, except T1 must be

THETAi Orientation angle of the longitudinal direction of each ply with the material axis of the
element. (If the material angle on the element connection entry is 0.0, the material axis and
side 1 -2 of the element coincide.) The plies are to be numbered serially starting with 1 at the

Main Index
3.The TREF specified on the material entries referenced by plies are not used. Instead TREF on the
PCOMP entry is used for all plies of the element. If not specified, it defaults to “0.0.”
If the PCOMP references temperature dependent material properties, then the TREF given on the
PCOMP will be used as the temperature to determine material properties.
TEMPERATURE Case Control commands are ignored for deriving the equivalent PSHELL and
MAT2 entries used to describe the composite element.
If for a nonlinear static analysis the parameter COMPMATT is set to YES, the temperature at the
current load step will be used to determine temperature-dependent material properties for the plies
and the equivalent PSHELL and MAT2 entries for the composite element. The TREF on the
PCOMP entry will be used for the initial thermal strain on the composite element and the stresses on
the individual plies. If the parameter EPSILONT is also set to INTEGRAL,TREF is not applicable.
4.GE given on the PCOMP entry will be used for the element and the values supplied on material
entries for individual plies are ignored. The user is responsible for supplying the equivalent damping
value on the PCOMP entry. If PARAM,W4 is not specified GE is ignored in transient analysis. When
GEij values are present on the MAT2 entry, Nastran will ignore the GE value given on the first
continuation entry field (6) of the MAT2 and the GE entry given in field (8) of the PCOMP entry
and use the given GEij values.
5.Stress and strain output for individual plies are available in all superelement static, normal modes,
buckling, frequency response (direct and modal), transient response (direct and modal) and nonlinear
static analysis and requested by the STRESS and STRAIN Case Control commands. Composite
lamina stress/strain are available in random analysis by XYPLOT command.
6.For Nastran conventional elements, if  PARAM,NOCOMPS is set to -1, stress and strain output for
individual plies will be suppressed and the homogeneous stress and strain output will be printed. See
also Remark 10.
7.In order to get failure index output the following must be present:
a.STRESS or STRAIN Case Control commands,
b.SB, FT, and SOUTi on the PCOMP Bulk Data entry,
c.Xt, Xc, Yt, Yc, and S on all referenced MAT8 Bulk Data entries if stress allowables are used, or
Xt, Xc, Yt, S, and STRN=1.0 if strain allowables are used.
d.-1 - failure in the fiber direction.
-2 - failure in the matrix direction
-12 - failure in the inplane shear
e.For Hashin Failure criterion, HFi  (i=1,2,3,4,10,11) must be present in all referenced MAT8 bulk
entry.
f.For Hashin Tape criterion, HTi (i=1,2,3,4,5,6,10,11,12) must be present in all referenced MAT8
bulk entry.
g.For Hashin Fabric criterion, HFBi (i=1,2,3,4,5,6,10,11,12) must be present in all referenced
MAT8 bulk entry.&lt;/p&gt;

h.Hashin failure theory output is captured with following code.
1 - failure in the tensile first fiber mode.
-1 - failure in the compressive first fiber mode.
2 - failure in the tensile second fiber mode.
-2 - failure in the compressive second fiber mode.
3 - failure in the tensile matrix mode.
-3 - failure in the compressive matrix mode.
8.A function of this entry is to derive equivalent internal PSHELL and MATi entries to describe the
composite element. Any sorted echo request will also cause printout and/or punch of the derived
PSHELL and MATi entries in User Information Message 4379 and/or the punch file . Use the
NASTRAN system cell (361) PRTPCOMP=1 to print equivalent PSHELL/MAT2 Bulk Data entries
to the .f06 file. Use the ECHO=PUNCH Case Control command to write them to the .pch file.
9.The failure index for the bonding material is calculated as Failure Index = .
10. If the value specified for Z0 is not equal to -0.5 times the thickness of the element and
PARAM,NOCOMPS,-1 is specified, then the homogeneous element stresses are incorrect, while
element forces and strains are correct. For correct homogeneous stresses, use ZOFFS on the
corresponding connection entry.  Z0 cannot be used if MDLPRM, LROFF is desired. In this case, the
offset must be specified by the ZOFFS field of the corresponding element connection entry.
11. Use of Z0 to offset a laminate does not change the reference plane. Z0 offsets the bottom of the plies
from the reference plane. An unsymmetric layup or the use of Z0 to specify an unsymmetric layup,
is not recommended in buckling analysis or the calculation of differential stiffness. Also, Z0 should
not be used to specify an unsymmetric layup. The presence of coupling between bending and
extension generally increases deflections. Hence, coupling decreases the effective stiffness of a
laminate, reduces buckling loads and vibration frequencies significantly.
12. To obtain the damping coefficient GE, multiply the critical damping ratio  by 2.0.
13. The SYM option for the LAM option computes the complete stiffness properties while specifying half
the plies. The MEM, BEND, SMEAR and SMCORE options provide special purpose stiffness
calculations. SMEAR ignores stacking sequence and is intended for cases where this sequence is not
yet known, stiffness properties are smeared. SMCORE allows simplified modeling of a sandwich
panel with equal face sheets and a central core.
14. Element output for the SMEAR and SMCORE options is produced using the PARAM NOCOMPS
-1 methodology that suppresses ply stress/strain results and prints results for the equivalent
homogeneous element.
15. Temperature-dependent ply properties only available in SOL 106 and SOL 400. See
PARAM,COMPMATT for details .
16. PCOMP is a primary property entry. Primary property entries are grouping entities for many
applications in MSC Nastran. Therefore it is highly recommended that the PCOMP property entries
have unique identification numbers with respect to all other property entries else unexpected
grouping results may occur. There must be uniqueness between PSHELL, PCOMP, PCOMPG
entries.1z2zSB

17. For PCOMP, the non-default Zo option should not be used in conjunction with MEM, BEND,
SMEAR or SMCORE as wrong results may occur. These four options provide special purpose
stiffness calculations wherein stacking sequence effects are ignored (membrane-bending coupling
terms are set to zero) at the preliminary design stage level. A better choice for offsets is to use the
ZOFF option on the connectivity entries (CQUAD4, CTRIA3 etc).
A User Fatal Message is issued if the user specifies a non-default value of Zo for any of the above
smearing options. The fatal message may be changed to a User Warning Message by specifying a
positive value for system cell 668  (e.g. nastran system(668)=1) t o allow the program to continue.
18. In SOL400 only, this entry may refer to MAT4 or MAT5 entries. If it does, and the user has not
supplied PSHLN1 entries, Nastran will internally generate a PSHLN1 entry. For details, the user
should refer to Remark 7. of the PSHLN1 entry.
19. In layer composite output, the traditional element model outputs stress or strain separately by using
STRESS or STRAN Case Control Command, respectively.
The advanced element model does not recognize STRAIN Case Control Command. As long as user
gives STRESS Case Control Command, both stress and strain are outputted together (similar to
NLSTRESS).&lt;/p&gt;

Remarks:
1.For CQUAD4 elements, the default formulation is Key-Hoff. For CTRIA3 elements, the default
formulation is C0-TRIA.
2.If the failure mode is such that fiber and shear strength or matrix and shear strength are lost in all
layers, the element is not included in the time-step calculation. If the element fails completely, the
element is omitted from the time-step calculations, irrespective of the value entered in this field.
3.If the STRNOUT field is NO, the strain cannot be output.
4.If ICLT is set to 1, the analysis is performed with classical lamination theory. In this case, it is not
possible to request the total strain output. The (transverse) shear correction factor input is ignored
since it is calculated inside Nastran. There is no update of the cross-sectional properties due to failure.
The failure flag only indicates that the failure condition is satisfied. Additional output for element
variables is available, namely the stress resultants (NXX, NYY, NXY, MXX, MYY, MXY, QYZ, and
QZX). Also the ABD-Q matrices of each element can be requested for output. These data are only
stored in the first layer. The variable names are AijM, BijM, DijM, and QsijM for the components
of the A-, B-, D- and Q-matrices, respectively. For example, to request the A11 of the A-matrix, the
variable name is A11M01.
5.The options for SPINCOR are:
When SPINCOR = NO, slight asymmetric forces are applied to the shell element’s grid points. This
approach is, in general, acceptable up to about 10° in plane shear angle.
The SPINCOR option is required for fabric models and is turned on by default to accurately keep
track of the fiber directions.NO No SPINCOR applied
YES SPINCOR applied
NO No SPINCOR correction is applied.
YES A SPINCOR correction is applied.Describer Meaning&lt;/p&gt;

Remarks:
1.The global ply identification number must be unique with respect to other plies in the entry. The
plies are defined in stacking sequence starting with the bottom layer.
2.The default for MID2, &amp;hellip;, MIDn is the last defined MIDi. In the example above, MID1 is the default
for MID2, MID3, and MId4. The same logic applies to Ti.
3.The global ply ID (GPLYIDi) and at least one of the four values (MIDi, Ti, THETAi, SOUTi) must
be present for a ply to exist. The minimum number of plies is one.“MEM” All plies must be specified, but only membrane terms (MID1 on the
derived PSHELL entry) are computed.
“BEND” All plies must be specified, but only bending terms (MID2 on the derived
PSHELL entry) are computed.
“SMEAR” All plies must be specified, stacking sequence is ignored MID1=MID2 on
the derived PSHELL entry and MID3, MID4 and TS/T and 12I/T**3
terms are set to zero).
“SMCORE” All plies must be specified, with the last ply specifying core properties and
the previous plies specifying face sheet properties. The stiffness matrix is
computed by placing half the face sheet thicknesses above the core and the
other half below with the result that the laminate is symmetric about the
mid-plane of the core. Stacking sequence is ignored in calculating the face
sheet stiffness.
GPLYIDi User-defined Global (External) Ply ID. See Remark 1. (Integer &amp;gt; 0)
MIDi Material ID of the various plies. The plies are identified by serially numbering them from 1
at the bottom layer. The MIDs must refer to MAT1, MAT2, or MAT8 Bulk Data entries.
See Remarks 2. and 15. For use with MAT4 and MAT5, see Remark 18. (Integer &amp;gt;0 or blank,
except MID1 must be specified.)
Ti Thicknesses of the various plies. See Remark 2. (Real &amp;gt; 0.0 or blank, except T1 must be
specified.)
THETAi Orientation angle of the longitudinal direction of each ply with the material axis of the
element. (If the material angle on the element connection entry is 0.0, the material axis and
side 1 -2 of the element coincide.) The plies are to be numbered serially starting with 1 at the
bottom layer. The bottom layer is defined as the surface with the largest -Z value in the
element coordinate system. (Real; Default =0.0)
SOUTi Stress or strain output request. See Remarks 6. and 7. (Character: “YES” or “NO”;
Default =“NO”)
GEFLG Ply structural damping flag may be only entered only once and if entered must be entered
on the first ply. At least two layers are required else frequency dependency is ignored. For a
one-layer PCOMPG use PCOMFQ entry for frequency dependency. (Integer -2,or -1;
Default=0) See Remark 17. Describer Meaning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2491 PCOMPG
Layered Composite Element Property (Alternate to PCOMP Entry)
Main Index
4.The TREF specified on the material entries referenced by plies are not used. Instead TREF on the
PCOMPG entry is used for all plies of the element. If not specified, it defaults to “0.0.”
If the PCOMPG references temperature dependent material properties, then the TREF given on the
PCOMPG will be used as the temperature to determine material properties.
TEMPERATURE Case Control commands are ignored for deriving the equivalent PSHELL and
MAT2 entries used to describe the composite element.
If for a nonlinear static analysis the parameter COMPMATT is set to YES, the temperature at the
current load step will be used to determine temperature-dependent material properties for the plies
and the equivalent PSHELL and MAT2 entries for the composite element. The TREF on the
PCOMPG entry will be used for the initial thermal strain on the composite element and the stresses
on the individual plies. If the parameter EPSILONT is also set to INTEGRAL,TREF is not
applicable.
5.GE given on the PCOMPG entry will be used for the element and the values supplied on material
entries for individual plies are ignored. The user is responsible for supplying the equivalent damping
value on the PCOMPG entry. If PARAM,W4 is not specified GE is ignored in transient analysis.
When GEij values are present on the MAT2 entry, Nastran will ignore the GE value given on the first
continuation entry field (6) of the MAT2 and the GE entry given in field (8) of the PCOMPG entry
and use the given GEij values.
6.Stress and strain output for individual plies are available in all superelement static,  frequency response
(direct and modal), transient response (direct and modal) and normal modes analysis and requested
by the STRESS and STRAIN Case Control commands. Composite lamina stress/strain are available
in random analysis by XYPLOT command.
7.For Nastran conventional elements, if  PARAM,NOCOMPS is set to -1, stress and strain output for
individual plies will be suppressed and the homogeneous stress and strain output will be printed. See
also Remark 11.
8.In order to get failure index output the following must be present:
a.STRESS or STRAIN Case Control commands,
b.SB, FT, and SOUTi on the PCOMPG Bulk Data entry,
c.Xt, Xc, Yt, Yc, and S on all referenced MAT8 Bulk Data entries if stress allowables are used, or
Xt, Xc, Yt, S, and STRN=1.0 if strain allowables are used.
d.-1 - failure in the fiber direction
-2 - failure in the matrix direction
-12 - failure in the inplane shear.
e.For Hashin Failure criterion, HFi  (i=1,2,3,4,10,11) must be present in all referenced MAT8 bulk
entry.
f.For Hashin Tape criterion, HTi (i=1,2,3,4,5,6,10,11,12) must be present in all referenced MAT8
bulk entry.
g.For Hashin Fabric criterion, HFBi (i=1,2,3,4,5,6,10,11,12) must be present in all referenced
MAT8 bulk entry.&lt;/p&gt;

h.Hashin failure theory output is captured with following code.
1 - failure in the tensile first fiber mode.
-1 - failure in the compressive first fiber mode.
2 - failure in the tensile second fiber mode.
-2 - failure in the compressive second fiber mode.
3 - failure in the tensile matrix mode.
-3 - failure in the compressive matrix mode.
9.A function of this entry is to derive equivalent internal PSHELL and MATi entries to describe the
composite element. Any sorted echo request will also cause printout and/or punch of the derived
PSHELL and MATi entries in User Information Message 4379 and/or the punch file . Use the
NASTRAN system cell (361) PRTPCOMP=1 to print equivalent PSHELL/MAT2 Bulk Data entries
to the .f06 file. Use the ECHO=PUNCH Case Control command to write them to the .pch file.
10. The failure index for the bonding material is calculated as Failure Index = .
11. If the value specified for Z0 is not equal to -0.5 times the thickness of the element and
PARAM,NOCOMPS,-1 is specified, then the homogeneous element stresses are incorrect, while
lamina stresses and element forces and strains are correct. For correct homogeneous stresses, use
ZOFFS on the corresponding connection entry. Use of Z0 to offset a laminate does not change the
reference plane. Z0 offsets the bottom of the plies from the reference plane.  Z0 cannot be used if
MDLPRM, LROFF is desired. In this case, the offset must be specified by the ZOFFS field of the
corresponding element connection entry.
12. An unsymmetric layup or the use of Z0 to specify an unsymmetric layup, is not recommended in
buckling analysis or the calculation of differential stiffness. Also, Z0 should not be used to specify an
unsymmetric layup. The presence of coupling between bending and extension generally increases
deflections. Hence, coupling decreases the effective stiffness of a laminate, reduces buckling loads and
vibration frequencies significantly.
13. To obtain the damping coefficient GE, multiply the critical damping ratio  by 2.0.
14. Element output for the SMEAR and SMCORE options is produced using the PARAM NOCOMPS
-1 methodology that suppresses ply stress/strain results and prints results for the equivalent
homogeneous element.
15. Temperature-dependent ply properties only available in SOL 106 and SOL400. See
PARAM,COMPMATT for details .
16. PCOMPG is a primary property entry. Primary property entries are grouping entities for many
applications in MSC Nastran. Therefore it is highly recommended that the PCOMPG property
entries have unique identification numbers with respect to all other property entries else unexpected
grouping results may occur. There must be uniqueness between PSHELL, PCOMP, PCOMPG

&lt;li&gt;for all subsequent plies will be used in computing the K4 structural
damping properties for the composite. For any MIDi for which there is no
associated GE value on the MAT1, MAT2, or MAT8 entry, the GE value
specified in Field 8 of the PCOMPG parent entry will be used. The resulting
smeared value GE will be placed in field 8 of the PCOMPG and used for
computing structural damping.
-2 The GEi value associated with the MID1 of this ply and the MIDi with MID(i&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for all subsequent plies will be used in computing the K4 structural
damping properties for the composite. For any MIDi for which there is no
associated GE value on the MAT1, MAT2, or MAT8 entry then that ply will
not contribute to the computation of the K4 structural damping of the
composite. The resulting smeared value GE will be placed in field 8 of the
PCOMPG and used for computing structural damping.
When GEFLG is used, the smeared GE value will appear in the second continuation entry field
(6) of the four internally generated equivalent MAT2 entries
If GEFLG appears with extended MAT2 entries the GEFLG is ignored for that PCOMPG: See

a.For BEH = SLCO MP and INT = ASTN, the X axis of the COR DM system is projected onto the
layer plane to form the local X axis. The normal direction of the element (thickness direction =
local Z axis) is crossed with the local X axis to yield the local Y axis. THETAi is then measured
positive counter-clockwise about the local Z axis. If the X axis of the CORDM is in the same

If CPROJ is ON then the projection scheme (see Figure 9-120) is activated. With the activation of
projection scheme the X axis of the CORDM system is projected onto the layer plane to form the
local X axis. The normal direction of the element (thickness direction = local Z axis) is crossed with
the local X axis to yield the local Y axis. THETAi is then measured positive counter-clockwise about
the local Z axis. If the X axis of the CORDM is in the same direction as the thickness direction, then
the analysis will stop with an error.

plane.  gives the Ym. Angle theta is measured counter-clockwise from Xm axis about the
Zm axis.
If CPROJ is OFF (default), THETAi is then measured positive counter-clockwise about the local Z
axis. The local Z is perpendicular to layer plane defined by the layu p direction via DIRECT describer .

Remarks:
1.The ID of the PDISTB is for user convenience of grouping identification and is not used for case
control selection.
2.The PID must point to an existing “Property” entry as shown in the Table of Remark 8. entry below.
If this entry is used, Nastran will check that all elements have a unique element ID across all element
types. If a n on-unique element ID is found a fatal message will be issued.
3.If no spatial distribution is given, the value associated with the named property entry will be used.
4.If an EID occurs on this entry for an element not associated with referred to property the EID is
ignored.
5.If an EID is referred to twice on this entry or another PDISTB entry with the same PID and PNAME,
Or in the case of a PCOMP or PCOMPG with same PID, PNAME, and LOCNUM referral a fatal
message will be issued.
6.VALUEi = SMULT* Vi + DELTA
7.The PID referred to may not have an associated PCOMPFQ entries.  A fatal message will be issued if
there is such an association.
8.For most Primary property entries, the QRG symbol is used for valid PNAME. See values in table
below. For more difficult entries such as a PCOMP the PNAME for example of the thickness of PLY
3 would be entered as PNAME=T and LOCNUM=3. Note on PCOMPG it is the numerical PLY
listed not the GPLYID. Thus for example if the second ply listed on a PCOMPG entry had
GPLYID=4 and the thickness is to be changed then PNAME=T and LOCNUM=2 not 4.

TYPE Name of a property entry . Allowed property types are: P BAR, PBEAM, PBEAM3,&lt;br&gt;
PCOMP , PCOMPG, PROD, PSHEAR, PSHELL, PSOLID, and PTUBE (Character-
Required).
PID Property identification number that matches the identification number of an existing

5.The MIDVi the user supplies must be a valid MATi entry unique across all existing MATi entries.
The MATi may have associated MATiF entries, however, TABLED5 (Frequency as a function of
temperature) entry is not currently supported with spatial entries.
6.The MIDNUM is property dependent. For example, a PROD has a single MID so the value 1
(default) is appropriate, on the other hand a P SHELL has MID1 through MID4, so a MIDNUM=3
means that the MID3 field of the PSHELL is being changed. For PCOMP or PCOMPG the
MIDNUM refers to the MIDi of the literal order of the ply stack. For a PCOMPG this means the
ply number starting with 1 from the first ply and not the GPLYID ID.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PELAS
Scalar Elastic Property2516
Main Index
Specifies the stiffness, damping coefficient, and stress coefficient of a scalar elastic (spring) element (CELAS1
or CELAS3 entry).
Format:
Example:
Remarks:
1.Be careful using negative spring values.
2.Spring values are defined directly on the CELAS2 and CELAS4 entries, and therefore do not require
a PELAS entry.
3.One or two elastic spring properties may be defined on a single entry.
4.For a discussion of scalar elements, see Scalar Elements (CELASi, CMASSi, CDAMPi)  in the MSC Nastran
Reference Guide .
5.If PARAM,W4 is not specified, GEi is ignored in transient analysis. See Parameters .
6.To obtain the damping coefficient GE, multiply the critical damping ratio  by 2.0.
7.If PELAS is used in conjunction with PELAST, Ki &amp;gt; 0, and the initial slope of the nonlinear force-
displacement relationship defined by the PELAST should agree with Ki.
8.PELAS is a primary property entry. Primary property entries are grouping entities for many
applications in MSC Nastran. Therefore it is highly recommended that the PELAS property entries
have unique identification numbers with respect to all other property entries else unexpected
grouping results may occur. There must be uniqueness between PELAS entries.PELAS Scalar Elastic Property

which do not attach to any omitted degrees-of-freedom.
2.For frequency dependent modal frequency response the modes are computed using the nominal Ki
values as specified on the PELAS entry.
3.The nominal values are used for all analysis types except frequency response and nonlinear analyses.
For frequency dependent modal frequency response the system modes are computed using the
nominal Ki values. The frequency -dependent values are used at every excitation frequency. For
nonlinear analysis the nominal values for Ki should agree with the initial slope of the nonlinear force-
displacement relationship defined by the PELAST, or the results will be unpredictable.

Frequency Dependent or Nonlinear Elastic Property
Main Index
5.PELAST is used in SOL 108 and SOL 111 when TKID or TGEID is specified. It is used in SOL
106, SOL 129 and SOL 400 when TKIND is specified. It is ignored in all other solution sequences .
6.The CELAS1/3 elements linear force computation F=K(U1-U2), conflicts with the below figure, in
that an obvious tension loading produces a compressive force.
The PELAST, TKNID option, for this loading, internally uses the F=K(U2-U1) when computing
the element tangent matrix. This allows for tension only loading, the use of a single sided load-
deflection curve to compute the element stiffness.
For element material nonlinear force and stress output, the default PELAST, TKNID option, the sign
convention used is F=K(U2-U1).
For a user desiring that the material nonlinear force and strain output, be consistent with the linear
CELAS1/3 elements, the Nastran system cell NASTRAN DELTAU=1 is provided.
The tangent stiffness is still computed using F=K(U2-U1), but for nonlinear force and stress output
the convention is F= - K(U2-U1).
While the PELAST, TKNID default option is more consistent with the figure above, in general for
U1&amp;gt;U2, a compressive force will result. When tension or compression may occur, then the load
deflection curves must be two sided curves as shown in the above figure.&lt;/p&gt;

CFAST Fastener Property
Main Index
c.If MCID &amp;gt;  0 and MFLAG = 1, then the MCID will be used to compute stiffness. KT1 will be
applied along the MCID T1 axis, KT2 along the MCID T2 axis, and KT3 along the MCID T3
axis. The element forces will be computed in the coordinate system defined in Remark 1b.
d.If the length of GA - GB is zero, then the element  axis is defined to lie along the projected
normal to patch A.
2.The diameter D is used along with the piercing points of GA and GB to determine the location of
fictitious grid points to form a fictitious hexa volume that determines the elements and physical grids
used for the fastener element. Four points are positioned at  positions parallel to the element axis
where . The stiffness contribution of the fastener depends on both the stiffness values
specified and the diameter D. It is a function of D, because the  positions are used along with the
surface shape functions of the fictitious hexa to weight the contribution of the physical grids used to
the grids GA and GB of the fastener element.
3.The CFAST element (see Figure 9-121), for stiffness and structural damping calculations, is designed
to satisfy rigid body equilibrium requirements. When  has finite length, internal rigid links
connect grids GA and GB. This may result in coupling between translational and rotational degrees-
of freedom even when no rotational stiffness (KR1-KR3) are specified.
For mass calculations, half the specified mass value is placed directly onto the projected grid A and
grid B translational degrees-of-freedom.

Frequency Dependent and material nonlinear CFAST Property
Main Index
Remarks:
1.For frequency dependent modal frequency response the modes are computed using the nominal Ki
values as specified on the PFAST entry.
2.The nominal values are used for all analysis types except frequency response. For frequency dependent
modal frequency response the system modes are computed using the nominal Ki values. The
frequency-dependent values are used at every excitation frequency.
3.The PFASTT entry may only be referenced by CFAST elements in the residual structure of SOL400
which do not attach to any omitted degrees-of-freedom.
4.For nonlinear analysis the nominal values for Ki on the PFAST should agree with the initial slope of
the nonlinear force-displacement relationship defined by the PFASTT, or the results will be
unpredictable.DIR The fuse direction. (0 &amp;lt; Integer &amp;lt; 6; Default = 0). 0 or 123456 imply any direction may

Remarks:
1.The KF field can be used in lieu of or in addition to the FINISH &amp;amp; KTREAT field to modify the
fatigue limit by multiplying the original fatigue limit by this value.   POOR = Poor Machined.
ROLLED = As Rolled. CAST = As Cast. KROUGH and KSURFC require that a KFINISH be
entered. A material CODE on the MATFTG entry must be supplied to use anything other than
NONE or POLISH, otherwise an error is issued.
2.If KFINISH = KSURFC, the user should enter a value for surface roughness Rz in m.  This is the
average surface roughness according to the German standard DIN 4768. The Surface Roughness
Factor Kr will then be calculated based on the strength and type of material (for example stronger
materials are in general more sensitive to surface finish, and cast materials less so).  The method for
calculating Kr is taken from the FKM guideline Analytical Strength Assessment of Components in
Mechanical Engineering .
If Rz &amp;lt;= 1m, Kr = 1.
Otherwise:
Kr = 1-ar log (Rz) log(2Rm/Rm,N,min )
Rm is the UTS in MPa
Rm,N,min  and ar are constants.
3.Fatigue strength reduction factor can take into account notch effects, size effects, and loading type
influence.   where the latter three are correction factors for each
effect, respectively.
4.If T1, T2, and DIAM are specifically supplied, they are used directly in the fatigue analysis of spot
welds. If either T1 or T2 are blank, the thicknesses are automatically determined from the PSHELL
entries that connect the spot welds. Table 9-33  Constants for Derivation of Surface Roughness Factor Kr from Roughness Rz

Fatigue Properties.2536
Main Index
When performing optimization using SOL 200, it is necessary to leave T1 and T2 blank if the
connecting shell thicknesses are being used as design variable, otherwise the fatigue analysis of the spot
welds will not use correct thicknesses from one design cycle to another.
5.If DIAM is left blank, the following rule is used:
•The diameter is derived based on the minimum thickness of the two sheets either side of the weld
by performing a lookup on a table. An example t able is provided in the spotweld.sys  file in the
msc20xx/ util d irectory of a standard MSC Nastran installation. This is true for element types
CBAR/CBEAM and CHEXA used to define spot welds. If using CWELD elements the diameter
is automatically extracted from the PWELD entry, if SPTFLG=0. If SPTFLG=1, then the lookup
table is used for CWELDs.  The spotweld.sys  file is specified by including the
spotweld=&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;/spotweld. sys on the Nastran command line or defining it in the Nastran
RC file as is done with other keywords. See Executing MSC Nastran  (Ch. 1). If not specified, the
default table is used as given in the example file mentioned.
In the case of a table lookup to determine DIAM, the thicknesses of the top and bottom sheets must
be within the range of the lookup table, which is up to 3mm by default. Otherwise a fatal error is
issued. Also the diameter is set as a function of the thickness of the thinnest sheet joined by the spot
weld. No interpolat ion b etween the data points in the spotweld.sys  file is done; rather, the
thickness of the thinnest sheet from each spot weld is compared to the table, and the value of thickness
that is nearest to but less than or equal to the thickness of the sheet is identified. The corresponding
diameter from the table is assigned to that spot weld.
Example spotweld.sys  file:
SPOT WELD DEFINITION FILE
NUGGET_DIAMETER=BY_THICKNESS
0.3,3.5
0.8,4.0
1.2,5.0
2.0,5.5
3.0,6.0
Note that there may be rounding errors in the extraction of sheet thicknesses, so when defining a
spotweld.sys file, it may be a good idea to reduce the sheet thickness values by a small tolerance in
order to avoid anomalous results

2.For most contact problems, KA (penalty value) should be chosen to be three orders of magnitude
higher than the stiffness of the neighboring grid points. A much larger KA value may slow
convergence or cause divergence, while a much smaller KA value may result in inaccurate results. The
value is adjusted as necessary if TMAX &amp;gt;0.0.
3.When the gap is open, there is no transverse stiffness. When the gap is closed and there is friction, the
gap has the elastic stiffness (KT) in the transverse direction until the friction force is exceeded and
slippage starts to occur.
4.There are two kinds of gap elements: adaptive gap and nonadaptive gap. If TMAX &amp;gt;0.0, the adaptive
gap element is selected by the program. When TMAX =0.0, penalty values will not be adjusted, but
other adaptive features will be active (i.e., the gap -induced stiffness update, gap -induced bisection,
and subincremental process). The value of TMAX =-1.0 selects the nonadaptive (old) gap element.
The recommended allowable penetration TMAX is about 10% of the element thickness for plates or
the equivalent thickness for other elements that are connected to the gap.
5.The maximum adjustment ratio MAR is used only for the adaptive gap element. Upper and lower
bounds of the adjusted penalty are defined by
where  is either KA or KT.
6.TRMIN is used only for the penalty value adjustment in the adaptive gap element. The lower bound
for the allowable penetration is computed by . The penalty values are decreased
if the penetration is below the lower bound.

preferred method. For this method, the sum of all the fractional percentages of thickness must
sum to 1.0.

&lt;p&gt;PLOAD
Static Pressure Load2546
Main Index
Defines a uniform static pressure load on a triangular or quadrilateral surface comprised of surface elements
and/or the faces of solid elements.
Format:
Example:
Remarks:
1.In the static solution sequences, SID must be selected by the LOAD Case Control command.
In the dynamic solution sequences, if there is a LOADSET Case Control command, then SID must
be referenced in the LID field of a selected LSEQ entry.  If there is no LOADSET Case Control
command, then SID must be referenced in the EXCITEID field of an RLOADi or TLOADi entry.
2.The grid points define either a triangular or a quadrilateral surface to which a pressure is applied. If
G4 is blank, the surface is triangular.
3.In the case of a triangular surface, the assumed direction of the pressure is computed according to the
right-hand rule using the sequence of grid points G1, G2, G3 illustrated in Figure 9-125.

Static Pressure Load
Main Index
The total load on the surface (see Figure 9-126), AP, is divided into three equal parts and applied to the
grid points as concentrated loads. A minus sign in field 3 reverses the direction of the load.
4.In the case of a quadrilateral surface, the grid points G1, G2, G3, and G4 should form a consecutive
sequence around the perimeter. The right -hand rule is applied to find the assumed direction of the
pressure. Four concentrated loads are applied to the grid points in approximately the same manner as
for a triangular surface. The following specific procedures are adopted to accommodate irregular
and/or warped surfaces:
•The surface is divided into two sets of overlapping triangular surfaces. Each triangular surface is
bounded by two of the sides and one of the diagonals of the quadrilateral.
•One-half of the pressure is applied to each triangle, which is then treated in the manner described
in Remark 2.

5.The follower force effects due to loads from this entry are included in the stiffness in all linear solution
sequences that calculate a differential stiffness. The solution sequences are SOLs 103, 105, 107 to
112, 115 and 116 (see also the parameter FOLLOWK , 849). In addition, follower force effects are
included in the force balance in the nonlinear static and nonlinear transient dynamic solution
sequences, SOLs 106, 129, 153, 159  and 4 00 if geometric nonlinear effects are turned on with
PARAM,LGDISP,1. The follower force stiffness is included in the nonlinear static solution sequences
(SOLs 106, 153  and 4 00) but not in the nonlinear transient dynamic solution sequences (SOLs 129

4.The preceding mass invariant calculation currently depends on a lumped mass formulation. The
parameter PARAM,COUPMASS should not be specified when executing the Nastran/ADAMS
interface.

6.If PARAM,GRDPNT,value specified, mass invariants , , and  will be obtained from an
Nastran grid point weight generator execution in the basic system.
7.The following DTI,UNITS Bulk Data entry is required for a FLEXBODY=YES run:
Since ADAMS is not a unitless code (as is Nastran), units must be specified. A DTI Bulk Data entry
provides ‘UNITS’ (a unique identifier) input as the following example illustrates. Once identified, the
units will apply to all superelements in the model. Acceptable character input strings are listed in the
following table.

A note of clarification about UNITS and its relation to Nastran’s WTMASS parameter: WTMASS,
though necessary to achieve units consistency in Nastran, is ignored in the output for ADAMS. Units
data for ADAMS is supplied on the UNITS DTI entry. For example, consider a model with mass in
grams, force in Newtons, length in meters, and time in seconds. A WTMASS parameter equal to
0.001 would ensure that Nastran works with a consistent set of units (kg, N, and m). The units
reported to ADAMS should then be: “DTI, UNITS, 1, GRAM, N, M, S.”
8.OUTSTRS or OUTSTRN entries require the use of the standard Nastran STRESS= or STRAIN=
Case Control commands to produce element stress or strain. STRESS(PLOT)= or STRAIN(PLOT)=
will suppress stress or strain output to the Nastran .f06 file.
9.OUTGSTRS or OUTGSTRN entries require the use of the standard Nastran STRESS= or
STRAIN= Case Control commands used in conjunction with GPSTRESS= or GPSTRAIN= Case

10. To reduce the finite element mesh detail for dynamic simulations, PSETID=set_entry is used to
define a set of PLOTELs or other elements used to display the component in ADAMS. If a mass
invariant computation is requested, this option can significantly reduce the size of the .mnf without
compromising accuracy in the ADAMS simulation.
If PSETID specifies an existing set from the OUTPUT(PLOT) Section of Nastran, this single set is
used explicitly to define elements to display in ADAMS. Otherwise, the Nastran Case Control
Section will be searched for a matching set ID. This matching set ID list then represents a list of
OUTPUT(PLOT) defined elements sets, the union of which will be used to define a set of PLOTELS
or other elements used to display the component in ADAMS. If the user wishes to select all of the sets
in the OUTPUT(PLOT) Section, then use PSETID=ALL.
The elements defined may include rigid element IDs. When defining these sets, do not  use
EXCLUDE and EXCEPT descriptions.
If a superelement analysis is being executed, any element defined on the PSETID=set_entry that lies
entirely on the superelement boundary (i.e., all of its grids are a-set or exterior to the superelement)
must also be specified on a SEELT Bulk Data entry. The SEELT entry would not be required for part
superelements, as boundary elements stay with their component.
OUTPUT(PLOT)
SET 7722 = 10001 THRU 10010
11. The ADMOUT=YES option requires the following assignment command in the File Management
Section of the Nastran file:
ASSIGN OUTPUT2=’name.out’ STATUS=UNKNOWN UNIT=20 FORM=UNFORM
It causes .op2 files with an .out extension to be generated . FLEXBODY=YES is required with its use.
The files’ outputs are: DTI-units, SE-number of superelements (9999 if residual), SEIDX-
superelement id, ASETX-size of a-set, BGPDTS-grid location table, GEOM2S-element connections,
GEOM4S-constraints and sets, MGGEW-physical mass external sort with weight mass removed,
VAEXT-a-set partition vector, VGEXT-g-set partition vector, VAPEXT-eigenvalue size partition
vector, MAAEW-modal mass, KAAE-modal stiffness, BAAE-modal damping, RAE-modal preload,
PAE-modal loads, CMODEXT-component modes, OES1-element stress shapes, OSTR1-element
strain shapes, OGS1-grid point stress shapes, OGSTR1-grid point strain shapes, OGSIPL-grid point
physical preload stress, OGTRIPL-grid point physical preload strain. The files are output for each
superelement and their generation depends on the loading and output requests.
To ensure compatibility with the ADAMS .op2-to-.mnf translator, if the ADAMSMNF Case
Control command has the keyword ADMOUT=YES, the Nastran SYSTEM word OP2NEW is
automatically set to OP2NEW=0. This means that any .op2 files generated will have a pre-MSC
Nastran 2004 format.
12. Environment variables controlling .mnf generation can be set before submitting the Nastran job, or
by using the Nastran keyword ‘MNFWRITEOPTIONS’ which can be abbreviated to any short
unique string such as ‘MNFW’. The Nastran keyword can be entered on the NASTRAN submittal
command line or in a user .nastran rc file. For example, interior grids and elements can be removed
in the .mnf by entering, prior to the Nastran submittal, with Korn shell:
export MDI_MNFWRITE_OPTIONS=strip_face
with C shell:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide
Control for Nastran/ADAMS Interface212
Main Index
setenv MDI_MNFWRITE_OPTIONS=strip_face
Or, at the time of Nastran submittal:
nastran_submittal_command jid MNFW=strip_face
Consult the ADAMS/Flex documentation for more information on the use of environment variables
during .mnf generation.
The command
nastran_submittal_command help mnfw
will generate the description of the symbol keyword.
The command
nastran_submittal_command help all
will generate a complete set of Nastran submittal keywords.
13. .mnf naming convention is as follows: for a single superelement run, ‘jid.mnf ’; for a residual only or
multiple superelement run ‘jid_seid.mnf’, etc.; where seid1 and seid2 are the integer numbers of the
superelement. The default location of these files is the same directory as the jid.f06 file.  See the
ASSIGN .mnf command to change directory location.
14. When supplying SPOINT/QSET combinations, there should be a sufficient number of
combinations to correctly capture the modal shapes. If n is the number of modes specified on the
EIGR or EIGRL Bulk Data entries and p is the number of loadcases specified, then the number of
SPOINTs( ns) should be at least  assuming that residual flexibility is on. In
general, there cannot be too many SPOINTS, as excess ones will simply be truncated with no
performance penalty.
15. The user can have Nastran automatically specify the SPOINT/QSET by including, above the Case
Control Section the parameter PARAM,AUTOQSET,YES. In this case no SPOINT/QSET can
appear in the Bulk Data. See the PARAM,AUTOQSET description for detailed requirements or
limitations.
16. By default, MSC Nastran 2005 will create a version 6.0 MNF. ADAMS 2005 is able to read the
version 6.0 .mnf file. Earlier ADAMS versions are not able to read a 6.0 .mnf file. Nastran can be
instructed to write a backward-compatible .mnf file by submitting the Nastran job with
MNFWRITEOPTIONS=full_str. Alternatively, the user may set the environment variable
MDI_MNFWRITE_OPTIONS to ‘full_str’. See Remark 12. for more information on controlling
the .mnf format.
17. In addition to modal stiffness and modal mass matrices, the modal damping matrix may also be
output to the .mnf. The damping allowed is the standard Nastran damping matrix consisting of
viscous damping,  structural damping,&lt;br&gt;
structural and Rayleigh damping, and  Rayleigh damping. Where g is set by
PARAM,G,value,  is set by PARAM,W3,value;  is set by PARAM,W4,value;  is set by

&lt;p&gt;213 CHAPTER 5
Control for Nastran/ADAMS Interface
Main Index
Additionally,  modal damping can be included by use of the Case Control command
SDAMP=n. For part superelement or superelement analyses, modal damping for each individual part
or superelement can be controlled by PARAM,SESDAMP,YES (PARAM,SESDAMP,NO is the
default) .
The Nastran/ADAMS interface does not allow for adding modal damping to structural damping
using PARAM,KDAMP,-1.
Direct input damping may also be included with the Case Control command B2GG=n. For part
superelement or superelement analyses, use of this command with the Nastran/ADAMS interface
requires fully expanded case control.
18. If preload is present in the model, physical gridpoint stress and strain for the preload may be output
to the .mnf using standard GPSTRESS= or GPSTRAIN= commands.
If preload is generated in a SOL 106 run for a SOL 103 restart, and the physical grid point stresses
for the preload are desired for the SOL 103 MNF run, then PARAM,FLEXNLS,YES is required
above the subcase level in the SOL 106 run.
For preload generated in a SOL 106 run for a SOL 103 restart, the preload subcase must be replicated
in the first subcase of the SOL 103 run.
19. After using the Nastran/ADAMS interface to produce an .mnf file and after preforming an ADAMS
solution, it is possible to bring the ADAMS results into Nastran for modal data recovery. ADAMS
produces .op2 files for input to Nastran SOL 111 and SOL 112. The files are binary format with an
.mdf extension. The File Management Section requires an assign command for each file:
ASSIGN INPUTT2=’name.mdf’ UNIT=ni
with a DLOAD =ni in the appropriate subcase.
Also, in the Bulk Data Section, the parameter PARAM,ADMPOST =m (m =0, by default no MSR
performed) is required. If m =1, rigid body motion is not considered in the structural deformation.
If m =2, rigid body motion is considered in the structural deformation.
Full details of the generation of the .mdf files and their use with Nastran are to be found in the
Nastran/ADAMS durability documentation.
20. In order to obtain consistent ADAMS results in Nastran data recovery run, when ADAMS data
brought back into Nastran SOL 111 or SOL 112, Nastran must be restarted from either of the
following two options:
a.From the original Nastran database that was produced during SOL103 MNF creation run
(created MNF is used in ADAMS run).B2H
SESDAMP
sesdamp =no Modal damping for each superelement
using the free boundary modes. SDAMP above subcase.
sesdamp =yes Modal damping for each superelement
using the fixed boundary CMS modes. SDAMP in superelement subcase.
For part superelements
each part may have a PARAM,SESDAMPSDAMP TABDMP1 

b.From the external SE (*.op2) that was produced during SOL103 MNF creation run (created
MNF is used in ADAMS run). The File Management section requires to assign command for
external SE op2.
ASSIGN INPUTT2=&amp;lsquo;EXTSE100.OP2&amp;rsquo; UNIT=ni
with following PARAM entries
PARAM ADMPOST,1 or 2 $
PARAM ADMEXTU , ni $  Where ni = unit # of external SE op2.
21. Typically SOL 400 is used to produce a preload for an ADAMS flexbody MNF run.
a.In the preload run the structure should be statically supported and follower loading must be
applied as a self equilibrating load set (not with SPC relationships!). In the ANALYSIS=MODES
step the structure must be a free-free structure as the resulting orthonormalization requires that
six rigid body modes be present.
In order to produce modal amplitudes and mode shapes and to ensure residual vector calculations,
SPOINTs and Q-sets are required. The SPOINTs must be included in the MAIN Bulk Data as
they are included in the overall matrix size.
A new BULK data section labeled BEGIN FLXBDY =id must be included with the run. This new
bulk section must contain the Q-set associate with the SPOINTs (in main bulk!) for modal
amplitudes and the A-set required for attachment point designation.
The example below is a typical SOL400 problem setup:

b.In the above example, the SPC set in the ANALYSIS=NLSTAT must be a static (non-redundant)
constraint condition. Note that in the ANALYSIS=MODES STEP, the SPC constraint set has
been removed.
In SOL 400, the definition of the attachment a-set for identifying attachment points and for q-
set for specifying the desired number of modal amplitudes for orthonormalization is done in a
separate new FLXBDY Bulk Data Section shown below:
$ FLEXBODY Bulk section
BEGIN BULK FLXBDY = 10
$ Attachment point and component mode (A-SET) selection
ASET1,123456,1,11,111,121
QSET1,0,100001,THRU,10002 0
In SOL400, the ASET/ASET1 and QSET/QSET1, MUST, appear in the FLXBDY bulk data
section.
Currently, only one FLXBDY bulk data section (with a positive Flexbody ID) is supported in
SOL 400. Any non set related Bulk entries appearing in this Section will be ignored.
c.If CONTACT is required as part of the preloading for the FLEXBODY=YES run, it is Highly
Recommended that the friction option be turned on by using an appropriate BCPARA bulk data
entry setting, e.g.,
$ Select bilinear Coulomb friction for all subcases
BCPARA, 0, FTYPE, 6
If contact friction is not turned on, the tangential motion between the two parts coming into
contact will most likely not be constrained and incorrect or fatal results will occur.
d.If RIGID elements (RBE1/RBE2/RBE3/RBAR/RROD/RJOINT) are in the model, then the
Case Control RIGID= LAGRANGE (default for SOL400) should be used to avoid possible
wrong results. If an attachment point happens to touch a rigid element, the point should be
associated with the independent degree of freedom of the rigid element. Though not
recommended, if for some modeling requirement, a dependent rigid element grid is required to
be in the attachment set, the user MUST include at least one independent/reference grid for that
specific rigid element in the ASET.
22. For STRUCTURE and FLUID coupled system, METHOD(COUPLED) can be used for MNF
generation. However, all nodes on fluid face need to be coupled with structure for ADAMSMNF
otherwise, mass and inertia of moment will be incorrect in MNF.
23. ACSETID references the SET of fluid grids for which acoustic modes are exported. A small number
of fluid grids is recommended for ACSETID. A warning message is issued and acoustic modes are not
exported if this set does not exist or if ACSETID=ALL  is chosen by the user.&lt;/p&gt;

Defines the Reference Aerodynamic Extra Point (Controller) Vector
Main Index
Reference UXVEC selector for the aeroelastic trim analysis. This is used to indicate an aerodynamic extra
point vector about which the stability derivatives are to be computed and printed. The stability derivatives
are the change in force due to a unit perturbation of each parameter in the aerodynamic extra point set. Due
to the nonlinear nature of the aeroelastic loads, the stability derivatives can be (but are not required to be) a
function of the point about which the slope is computed. This input defines which point is to be used in
computing the stability derivatives for printing (local slopes will be computed as needed in the trim solver).
This selection is typically done within each subcase, but a case control default can be defined by placing an
entry above the subcase level.
Format:
AEUXREF =
Examples:
AEUXREF=100
AEUXREF=TRIM
Remarks:
1.If, for a particular subcase, AEUXREF is not defined, the “free stream” state will be used (that is, the
stability derivatives will be computed about zero values for all parameters). This results in upward
compatibility with the linear database paradigm.
2.Only one of a TRIM or a UXVEC ID may be specified on any given subcase. To see stability
derivatives about additional points, you must define additional trim subcases.AEUXREF (Case) Defines the Reference Aerodynamic Extra Point (Controller) Vector

Main Index
Remarks:
1.This entry is used in solution sequences that are capable of multiple analysis types and selects the
actual analysis to be performed in the SUBCASE (or for SOL 400 the SUBCASE, STEP, or
SUBSTEP).
•For linear solution sequences SOLs 110, 111, and 112 and the nonlinear SOLs 106, 153, and
159, and for Optimization SOL 200 there can be only one ANALYSIS=  per SUBCASE
•For SOL 200, EVERY SUBCASE including any superelement SUBCASE must be assigned an
ANALYSIS=  Case Control command either in the explicit SUBCASE or above all SUBCASEs in
which case it defaults to all the subcases.
•For SOL 400 there can, for single physics analysis or chained multi physics analysis, be only one
ANALYSIS= per STEP.
•For SOL 400 coupled multi physics analysis there can be only one ANALYSIS= per SUBSTEP.
2.In the linear solution sequences SOLs 110, 111, 112, 145, and 146 this entry allows data recovery of
the normal modes data used in the in the complex Eigenvalue analysis, modal frequency analysis, or
modal transient analysis. All commands which control the boundary conditions (SPC, MPC, and
SUPORT) and METHOD selection should be copied inside the ANALYSIS=MODES  SUBCASE
or specified above the SUBCASE level. Note in the example below, SOL111 is a frequency response
solution sequence so in the frequency response SUBCASE 2 below an ANALYSIS=MFREQ  is
allowed but not required.

METH=40
SPC=1
SUBCASE 1 $ Normal Modes
ANALYSIS=MODES
DISP=ALL
SUBCASE 2 $ Frequency response
STRESS=ALL
DLOAD=12
FREQ=4
3.SOL 400 analysis allows for seven analysis type combinations (nonlinear single physics, nonlinear
chained physics, nonlinear coupled physics, linear perturbation analysis, standard linear physics,&lt;br&gt;
nonlinear chained analysis with mesh/time change physics, and   nonlinear response optimization with
ESLNRO (Equivalent Static Loads Nonlinear Response Optimization)) .
If there are linear, nonlinear and perturbation subcases, the linear subcases will be solved first. The
linear subcases are reordered for processing and the output will be in the following order regardless of
original subcase number: STATICS, MODES, BUCKLING, DFREQ or MFREQ, DCEIG or
MCEIG, SAERO, FLUTTER.
The general rule is: The solutions of all SUBCASEs are independent of each other. The solution of
any STEP is a continuation of the solution of the previous STEP in the same SUBCASE. The
solutions of the SUBSTEPs occur simultaneously within a STEP (coupled analysis):
Additionally the following rules should be observed:
•All Coupled Multi-Physics steps have to come before the Single-Physics steps.
•Single-Physics steps can follow the Multi-Physics Steps.&lt;/p&gt;

•All linear perturbation steps need to be at the end after definition of all possible coupled multi-
physics steps and single-physics steps.
•The Case Control Command NLIC used for Nonlinear Initial Condition should be referenced
for further requirements between the analysis types allowed in SOL 400.
a.Nonlinear single physics: Nonlinear structures or nonlinear heat:  For nonlinear structures a
ANALYSIS=NLSTAT  must come before a ANALYSIS=NLTRAN . Only Statics to Transient is
allowed for structures. For heat transfer a nonlinear steady state heat transfer to a nonlinear
transient heat transfer is also allowed  from V 2022.3 .
A structural example:
SUBCASE 1
STEP 10   &lt;br&gt;
ANALYSIS=NLSTAT
STEP 20
ANALYSIS=NLSTAT
STEP 30
ANALYSIS=NLTRAN
b.Nonlinear chained physics: A nonlinear steady state heat with results used for a nonlinear static
structural analysis. Only a steady state heat to a structural nonlinear Statics is allowed.
SUBCASE 1
STEP 10
ANALYSIS=HSTAT
STEP 20
ANALYSIS=NLSTAT
c.Nonlinear coupled physics: This allows for four combinations of STEP/SUBSTEP within the
SUBCASE
•ANALYSIS=HSTAT  for the first SUBSTEP and ANALYSIS=NLSTAT  for the second
SUBSTEP
•ANALYSIS=HTRAN  for the first SUBSTEP and ANALYSIS=NLTRAN  for the second
SUBSTEP
•ANALYSIS=HTRAN  for the first SUBSTEP and ANALYSIS=NLSTAT  for the second&lt;br&gt;

d.Linear perturbation analysis: Linear perturbation analysis is run directly after a nonlinear static
(ANALYSIS=NLSTAT) analysis using additional STEP commands containing
ANALYSIS=BUCK, MODES, DFREQ, MFREQ, MTRAN, DCEIG, and MCEIG entries .It
should be noted that ANALYSIS=BUCK for linear perturbation:
It should be noted that ANALYSIS=BUCK for linear perturbation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is not recommended if the model is highly nonlinear. NLBUCK Case Control command is
recommended for highly nonlinear models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;includes the differential stiffness in the static analysis step (ANALYSIS=NLSTAT and
ANALYSIS=STATIC) and therefore will not match the results of an equivalent SOL 105 run.
Here is an example of linear perturbation with frequency response analysis:

        &lt;p&gt;PLOAD1
Applied Load on CBAR, CBEAM or CBEND Elements2548
Main Index
Defines concentrated, uniformly distributed, or linearly distributed applied loads to the CBAR or CBEAM
elements at user -chosen points along the axis. For the CBEND element, only distributed loads over an entire
length may be defined.
Format:
Example:
Remarks:
1.In the static solution sequences, SID must be selected by the LOAD Case Control command.
In the dynamic solution sequences, if there is a LOADSET Case Control command, then SID must
be referenced in the LID field of a selected LSEQ entry.  If there is no LOADSET Case Control
command, then SID must be referenced in the EXCITEID field of an RLOADi or TLOADi entry.
2.If , a linearly varying distributed load will be applied to the element between positions X1
and X2, having an intensity per unit length of bar equal to P1 at X1 and equal to P2 at X2, except as
noted in Remarks 8. and 9.
3.If X2 is blank or equal to X1, a concentrated load of value P1 will be applied at position X1.
4.If P1 =P2 and X2  X1, a uniform distributed load of intensity per unit length equal to P1 will be
applied between positions X1 and X2 except as noted in Remarks 8. and 9.
5.Load TYPE is used as follows to define loads:
“FX”, “FY” or “FZ”: Force in the x, y, or z direction of the basic coordinate system.
“MX”, “MY” or “MZ”: Moment in the x, y, or z direction of the basic coordinate system.PLOAD1 Applied Load on CBAR, CBEAM or CBEND Elements

“FXE”, “FYE” or “FZE”: Force in the x, y, or z direction of the element’s coordinate system.
“MXE”, “MYE” or “MZE”: Moment in the x, y, or z direction of the element’s coordinate system.
6.If SCALE =“LE” (length), the xi values are actual distances along the element axis, and, if ,
then Pi are load intensities per unit length of the element.
7.If SCALE =“FR” (fractional), the xi values are ratios of the distance along the axis to the total length,
and (if ) Pi are load intensities per unit length of the element.
8.If SCALE =“LEPR” (length projected), the xi values are actual distances along the element axis, and
(if ) the distributed load is input in terms of the projected length of the element.

If SCALE =“LE”, the total load applied to the bar is P1 ( ) in the y -basic direction.
If SCALE =“LEPR”, the total load applied to the bar is P1 ( )cos in the y -basic direction.
9.If SCALE =“FRPR” (fractional projected), the Xi values are ratios of the actual distance to the length
of the bar (CBAR entry), and if , then the distributed load is specified in terms of the
projected length of the bar.

12. Only distributed loads applied over the entire length of the CBEND element may be applied.
13. Projected loads are not applicable to the CBEND element.
14. Loads on CBEAM elements defined with PLOAD1 entries are applied along the line of the shear
centers.
15. If a CBARAO or PLOAD1 entry is specified and stress and/or force output is requested, then the
stresses and/or forces will be calculated at each location Xi and output as a separate line. The force
and stress locations Xi=0 and Xi = will always be output. This output format will be used for all
beam and bar elements.
16. If on the TYPE field of the PLOAD1 entry, the element coordinate system direction (e.g.
TYPE =FYE) option is selected, then the projection (i.e. SCALE =FRPR or LEPR) option is ignored
and the result is the same as the SCALE =FR (or LE) option.RelemXelem

elements.
Format:
Example:
Alternate Format and Example:
Remarks:
1.In the static solution sequences, SID must be selected by the LOAD Case Control command.
In the dynamic solution sequences, if there is a LOADSET Case Control command, then SID must
be referenced in the LID field of a selected LSEQ entry.  If there is no LOADSET Case Control
command, then SID must be referenced in the EXCITEID field of an RLOADi or TLOADi entry.
2.At least one positive EID must be present on each PLOAD2 entry.
3.If the alternate form is used, all elements EID1 through EID2 must be two -dimensional.
4.The direction of the pressure is computed according to the right -hand rule using the grid point
sequence specified on the element entry. Refer to the PLOAD entry.
5.All referenced elements must exist (closed list) for residual only runs and are not required to exist
(open list) for superelement runs; and they cannot be hyperelastic for either.
6.The follower force effects due to loads from this entry are included in the stiffness in all linear solution
sequences that calculate a differential stiffness. The solution sequences are SOLs 103, 105, 107 to
112, 115 and 116 (see also the parameter FOLLOWK , 849). In addition, follower force effects are
included in the force balance in the nonlinear static and nonlinear transient dynamic solution PLOAD2 Uniform Normal Pressure Load on a Surface Element

grids.

&lt;p&gt;PLOAD4
Pressure Load on Surface and Faces of Solid Elements2554
Main Index
Remarks:
1.In the static solution sequences, SID must be selected by the LOAD Case Control command.
In the dynamic solution sequences, if there is a LOADSET Case Control command, then SID must
be referenced in the LID field of a selected LSEQ entry.  If there is no LOADSET Case Control
command, then SID must be referenced in the EXCITEID field of an RLOADi or TLOADi entry.
2.The continuation entry is optional. If fields 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the continuation entry are blank, the
load is assumed to be a pressure acting normal to the face. If these fields are not blank, the load acts
in the direction defined in these fields. Note that if CID is a curvilinear coordinate system, the
direction of loading may vary over the surface of the element. The load intensity is the load per  unit
of surface area, not the load per unit of area normal to the direction of loading.
3.For the faces of solid elements, the direction of positive pressure (defaulted continuation) is inward.
For triangular and quadrilateral faces, the load intensity P1 acts at grid point G1 and load intensities
P2, P3, (and P4) act at the other corners in a sequence determined by applying the right -hand rule to
the outward normal.
4.For plate  elements, the direction of positive pressure (defaulted continuation) is in the direction of
positive normal, determined by applying the right -hand rule to the sequence of connected grid points.
The load intensities P1, P2, P3, (and P4) act respectively at corner points G1, G2, G3, (and G4) for
triangular and quadrilateral elements. (See plate connection entries.)
5.If P2, P3, and P4 are blank fields, the load intensity is uniform and equal to P1. P4 has no meaning
for a triangular face and may be left blank in this case.
6.Equivalent grid point loads are computed by linear or bilinear interpolation of load intensity followed
by numerical integration using isoparametric shape functions. Note that a uniform load intensity will
not necessarily result in equal equivalent grid point loads.
7.G1 and G3 are ignored for CTRIA3, CTRIA6, CTRIAR, CQUAD4, CQUAD8, and CQUADR
elements.
8.The alternate format is available only for CTRIA3, CTRIA6, CTRIAR, CQUAD4, CQUAD8, and
CQUADR elements. The continuation entry may be used in the alternate format.G4 Identification number of the CTETRA grid  point located at the corner; this grid point
may not reside on the face being loaded. This is required data and is used for
CTETRA  elements only. (Integer &amp;gt;0)
CID Coordinate system identification number. See Remark 2. (Integer &amp;gt;0; Default =0)
N1, N2, N3 Components of vector measured in coordinate system defined by CID. Used to define
the direction (but not the magnitude) of the load intensity. See Remark 2. (Real)
SORL The character string SURF or LINE. SURF means the surface load acting on the
surface of the element and LINE means the consistent edge loads acting on the edges
of the element. The default is SURF . See Remark 13.
LDIR Denote the direction of the line load (SORL=LINE), character string X, Y, Z, TANG,
or NORM. The default is NORM. See Remark 14.Describer Meaning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2555 PLOAD4
Pressure Load on Surface and Faces of Solid Elements
Main Index
9.For triangular faces of CPENTA elements, G1 is an identification number of a corner grid point that
is on the face being loaded and the G3 or G4 field is left blank. For faces of CTETRA elements, G1
is an identification number of a corner grid point that is on the face being loaded and G4 is an
identification number of the corner grid point that is not on the face being loaded. Since a CTETRA&lt;br&gt;
has only four corner points, this point G4 will be unique and different for each of the four faces of a
CTETRA  element.
10. For the CQUADR and CTRIAR element, only pressure that acts normal to the element is  computed
properly. Surface tractions are not resolved into moments normal to the element.
11. All referenced elements must exist (closed list) for residual only runs and are not required to exist
(open list) for superelement runs; and they cannot be hyperelastic for either.
12. If fields 3 through 5 of the continuation entry are not blank, the load is assumed to have a fixed
direction. If fields 2 through 5 of the continuation entry are left blank, the load is assumed to be a
pressure load. In this case, follower force effects are included in the stiffness in all linear solution
sequences that calculate a differential stiffness. The solution sequences are SOLs 103, 105, 107 to
112, 115 and 116 (see also the parameter FOLLOWK ). In addition, follower force effects are included
in the force balance in the nonlinear static and nonlinear transient dynamic solution sequences, SOLs
106, 129, 153, 159  and 4 00, if geometric nonlinear effects are turned on with PARAM,LGDISP,1.
The follower force stiffness is included in the nonlinear static solution sequences (SOLs 106, 153  and
400) but not in the nonlinear transient dynamic solution sequences (SOLs 129 and 159).
13. The SORL field is ignored by all elements except QUADR and TRIAR. For QUADR or TRIAR
only, if SORL=LINE, the consistent edge loads are defined by the PLOAD4 entry. P1, P2, P3 and
P4 are load per unit length at the corner of the element. If all four Ps are given, then the line loads
along all four edges of the element are defined. If any P is blank, then the line loads for only two edges
are defined. For example, if P1 is blank, the line loads of the two edges connecting to G1 are zero. If
two Ps are given, then the line load of the edge connecting to the two grid points is defined. If only
one P is given, the second P value default to the first P value. For example, P1 denotes that the line
load along edge G1 and G2 has the constant value of P1.
14. The direction of the line load (SORL=LINE) is defined by either (CID, N1, N2, N3) or LDIR. Fatal
error will be issued if both methods are given. TANG denotes that the line load is in tangential
direction of the edge, pointing from G1 to G2 if the edge is connecting G1 and G2. NORM denotes
that the line load is in the mean plan, normal to the edge, and pointing outward from the element.
X, Y, or Z denotes the line load is in the X, Y, or Z direction of the element coordinate system. If both
(CID, N1, n2, N3) and LDIR are blank, then the default is LDIR=NORM .
15. For SOL 400, with large displacement (PARAM,LGDISP), higher-order 6-node triangles (CTRIA6),
8-node quadrilateral (CQUAD8), 20-node hexagonal (CHEXA), or 15-node pentahedral
(CPENTA), the load is not calculated correctly. Use lower-order elements if distributed loads are
required in a large displacement analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PLOADX1
Pressure Load on Axisymmetric Element2558
Main Index
Defines surface traction to be used with CAXISYM, CQUADX, CTRIAX, and CTRIAX6 axisymmetric
elements.
Format:
Example:
Remarks:
1.In the static solution sequences, SID must be selected by the LOAD Case Control command.
In the dynamic solution sequences, if there is a LOADSET Case Control command, then SID must
be referenced in the LID field of a selected LSEQ entry.  If there is no LOADSET Case Control
command, then SID must be referenced in the EXCITEID field of an RLOADi or TLOADi entry.
2.PLOADX1 is intended only for the CAXISYM, CQUADX, CTRIAX, and CTRIAX6 elements.
3.The surface traction is assumed to vary linearly along the element side between GA and GB.
4.The surface traction is input as force per unit area.  MSC Nastran converts this traction into
equivalent nodal loads by integration over the surface.  For AXISYM and hyperelastic QUADX and
TRIAX elements this integration is over one radian.  For TRIAX6 and axisymmetric harmonic
QUADX and TRIAX elements this integration is over two pi radians.
5.THETA is measured counter -clockwise from the inward normal of the straight line between GA and
GB, to the vector of the applied load, as shown in Figure 9-128, Figure 9-129, and Figure 9-130. Positive
pressure is in the direction of inward normal to the line segment.PLOADX1 Pressure Load on Axisymmetric Element

Dummy Plot Element Definition
Main Index
Defines a one -dimensional dummy element for use in plotting.
Format:
Example:
Remarks:
1.This element is not used in the model during any of the solution phases of a problem. It is used to
simplify plotting of structures with large numbers of colinear grid points, where the plotting of each
grid point along with the elements connecting them would result in a confusing plot.
2.Element identification numbers should be unique with respect to all other element identification
numbers.
3.Only one PLOTEL element may be defined on a single entry.
4.In superelement analysis, PLOTELs, as well as other elements such as CBAR, CQUAD4, etc., will
affect the formation of the superelement tree. The PLOTEL EIDs will also appear in the
superelement map output; see the description of PARAM,SEMAPPRT in Parameters .
5.Only grid points connected by structural elements appear on structure plots. This does not include
points connected only by rigid or general elements or MPCs. A plot element in parallel with elements
that do not plot will cause these points to be present.PLOTEL Dummy Plot Element Definition

applications in MSC Nastran. Therefore it is highly recommended that the PLPLANE property
entries have unique identification numbers with respect to all other property entries else unexpected
grouping results may occur. There must be uniqueness among PLPLANE, PAXSYMH, and PSHELL
entries.
7.When using Enhanced materials (SOL400), the MID field may point to additional Material entries

&lt;p&gt;PMARKER
Property Definition of a Marker Element2566
Main Index
Defines the behavior of the marker element in the EULER domain. Used in SOL 700 only.
Format:
Example:
Remarks:
1.The PMARKER entry will be ignored for elements that are referring to structural grid points. These
structural grid points will move with the structure and the Euler velocities do not change their
velocity.
2.TYPE = FIXED. This means that the marker is stationary through out the simulation and it is
therefore not moving with the Euler velocity. If the marker grid is located outside the Eulerian
domain(s), the Marker will still be allowed to exist. It means, however, that no variables are recorded
and that the variables will appear as zero on the Time History plots.
3.TYPE = MOVING. The marker is moving along with the Eulerian material. When the grid point
approaches a coupling surface there is no mechanism that prevents the marker from passing through
the coupling surface. When this happens the marker enters an element that is covered and motion of
the grid point will stop. It is allowed that the grid point moves from one Euler domain to the other
through a porous hole or a coupling surface with interactive failure.PMARKER Property Definition of a Marker Element

Scalar Mass Property
Main Index
Specifies the mass value of a scalar mass element (CMASS1 or CMASS3 entries).
Format:

Remarks:
1.Mass values are defined directly on the CMASS2 and CMASS4 entries, and therefore do not require
a PMASS entry.
2.Up to four mass values may be defined by this  entry.
3.For a discussion of scalar elements, see Scalar Elements (CELASi, CMASSi, CDAMPi)  in the MSC Nastran
Reference Guide .
4.PMASS is a primary property entry. Primary property entries are grouping entities for many

        &lt;p&gt;PMINC
Constant Spallation Model2568
Main Index
Defines a spallation model where the minimum pressure is constant. Used in SOL 700 only.
Format:
Example:
Remarks:
1.If the pressure in an element falls below the minimum pressure, the element spalls. The pressure and
yield stress are set to zero.
2.The default for the volume cutoff tolerance is 1.E-4. This value should be decreased in case of large
mass increase of material without any reason .
3.If an element spalls a void is created. In order to prevent getting void fractions that are too small, a
void fraction is put to zero if it is smaller than FVTOL. The default for FVTOL is 1.E-4 and works
only for Eulerian elements. This value should be decreased in case of large mass increase of material
without any reason. Voids can be created during transport of material, because of a material failure
and by unloading.PMINC Constant Spallation Model

Main Index
4.With FVTOL2 = 0, any void fraction in an element will lead to failure, and then no tensile stresses
are possible. In simulations in which tensile conditions are present, it can be required to allow for
tensile stresses in the presence of a small void fraction not exceeding a threshold. This threshold is
given by FVTOL2. A good value for FVTOL2 = 2 * FVTOL = e.E-4. FVTOL 2 is only used for
Eulerian materials. FVTOL 2 should be larger than FVTOL.&lt;/p&gt;

(Character; Default = SMALL)
SMALL The size of the hole in the surface is the same or smaller than the size of the
Euler mesh used. The velocity of the gasflow through the hole is based on
the theory of one-dimensional gas flow through a small orifice, and depends
on the pressure difference. This is the method that is used if the PORHOLE
is used on a GBAG entry.
LARGE The size of the hole in the surface is larger than the Euler mesh used. The
velocity of the gasflow through the hole is based on the velocity method for
an Eulerian air bag. If the PORHOLE is used on a GBAG entry, it will
default back to method used for SIZE=SMALL.

Time Dependent Porous Flow Boundary2580
Main Index
6.The boundary condition initiates/determines a wave in compressible material like gas and water. This
can be either an outgoing or an ingoing wave. For stability it is important that the waves created are
compatible with the flow type near the boundary. Relevant flow types are subsonic inflow, subsonic
outflow, supersonic inflow and supersonic outflow. For example for subsonic inflow prescribing both
pressure and velocity would initiate outgoing waves. Outgoing waves for an inflow boundary
condition is known to be instable. However, for supersonic inflow one can specify both pressure and
velocity since there are no outgoing waves at a supersonic inflow boundary.&lt;/p&gt;

PORHOLE 301
Describer Meaning
PID Unique number of a PORHOLE entry. (Integer &amp;gt; 0; Required)
SIZE Defines the type of flow method that is used for mass leaving or entering the airbag
volume. (Character; Default = SMALL)
SMALL The size of the hole in the surface is the same or smaller than the size of
the Euler mesh used. The velocity of the gasflow through the hole is based
on the theory of one-dimensional gas flow through a small orifice, and
depends on the pressure difference. This is the method that is used if the
PORHOLE is used on a GBAG entry.
LARGE The size of the hole in the surface is larger than the Euler mesh used. The
velocity of the gasflow through the hole is based on the velocity method
for an Eulerian air bag. If the PORHOLE is used on a GBAG entry, it
will default back to method used for SIZE=SMALL.
FLOW Defines the allowed directions of the flow. (Character; Default = BOTH)
BOTH In- and outflow are allowed.
IN Only inflow allowed.
OUT Only outflow allowed.

CP Environmental specific heat at constant pressure. See Remark 4. (Real &amp;gt; 0.0)
MID MATDEUL ID number of the environment gas. Only used for an Eulerian air bag that
uses the multi-material Euler solver and SIZE=LARGE. See Remark 6. (Integer &amp;gt; 0)&lt;/p&gt;

Holes in Air Bag Surface2582
Main Index
Remarks:
1.The PORHOLE entry can be referenced from a LEAKAGE entry.
2.When used with Euler, this entry can only be used with the single material hydrodynamic Euler
solver, using an EOSGAM (ideal gas) equation of state.
3.The values for the environment  (PENV),  (RHOENV),  (SIEENV) must be
defined consistent with an ideal-gas equation of state:
The  is calculated and is only used when inflow occurs. Inflow occurs when .
4.CP is only required if updating of Euler or gasbag gas constants is done, for example if hybrid inflators
are defined.
5.For in and out flow of an uniform pressure air bag (GBAG), the material transport is based on the
theory of one-dimensional gas flow through a small orifice, and depends on the pressure difference.
This is equivalent to the PORHOLE entry.
6.When used in combination with the single material hydrodynamic Euler solver, an EOSGAM (ideal
gas) equation of state is required. In that case, the material number, MID, can be left blank. When
using the multi-material solver, the material number, MID, has to point to one of the Eulerian
materials and the equation of state of that material has to be of type EOSGAM.penvenveenv

&lt;p&gt;2583 PORHYDS
Porous Flow Bondary with a Hydrostatic Pressure Profile
Main Index
Prescribes a hydrostatic pressure profile on a porous BSURF . Used in SOL 700 only.
Format:
Example:
Remarks:
1.Reference PID by a LEAKAGE entry.
2.The surface can be only a general coupling surface (see the COUPLE entry).
3.It is required that the coupling surface refers to a HYDSTAT entry. This HYDSTAT entry will be
used to prescribe a hydrostatic pressure profile on the subsurface. For example, the water level and
atmospheric pressure are taken from the HYDSTYAT entry. This defines the pressure and the inflow
density.
4.In contributions of the surface to the Euler elements the pressure gradient across the surface is taken
into account. Therefore splitting up of the surface and creating new PORHYDS entries does not
increase the accuracy of prescribed pressures. If the water level and atmospheric pressure are the same
in the whole region outside the coupling surface using one PORHYDS entry is sufficient.
5.The atmospheric pressure is prescribed on those parts of the surface that are above the water level.PORHYDS Porous Flow Bondary with a Hydrostatic Pressure Profile

Shell Element Property
Main Index
Remarks:
1.PSHELL is a primary property entry. Primary properties are used to internally group entities.
Therefore it is highly recommended that PSHELL entries use unique identification numbers (PIDs)
with respect to all other property entries to avoid unexpected grouping results. PSHELL, PCOMP,
and PCOMPG entries must have unique PIDs.
2.The structural mass is calculated from the density using the membrane thickness and membrane
material properties. If MID1 is blank, then the density is obtained from the MID2 material.
3.The results of leaving an MIDi field blank (or MID2 =-1) are :
4.The continuation entry is not required.
5.The structural damping (GE on the MATi entry) is obtained from the MID1 material. If MID1 is
blank, then it is obtained from the MID2 material. If PARAM,SHLDAMP,DIFF is set or is anything
other than SAME, then the structural damping  matrix is computed using the GE entries on the
MATi entries according to rules in the following table ( Table 28). If a single PSHELL corresponds to
row eight (8) of Table 28, then all PSHELLs in the model will follow the rule of row eight (8). Rows
1-7 is an attempt to maintain upward compatibility, if a user inadvertently places a SHLDAMP,DIFF
in the model.
.MID1 No membrane or coupling stiffness
MID2 No bending, coupling, or transverse shear stiffness
MID3 No transverse shear flexibility
MID4 No bending -membrane coupling unless ZOFFS is specified on the connection

PSHELL rules with extended MAT2 entries
The PSHELL has four MIDi entries: MID1-Membrane; MID2-Bending; MID3-T ransverse
Shear; MID4-Membran-Bending Coupling.
The Damping for shell elements is determined by the GE value associated to the material entry
specified by MID1 (or MID2 if MID1 is blank).
PSHELL allows any of its MIDi fields to use any combination of MAT1, MAT2, or MAT8
material entries.
The MAT2 entry has a feature consisting of six (6) structural damping coefficients called G E11,
GE12, GE13, GE22, GE23, and GE33 in a second continuation entry . When any one or more of
these GEij entries are non-zero , the GE entry in field six (6)  of the first continuation entry is
ignored for that material.      

Shell Element Property

6.The following should be considered when using MID4.
•The MID4 field should be left blank if the material properties are symmetric with respect to the
middle surface of the shell. If the element centerline is offset from the plane of the grid points but
the material properties are symmetric, the preferred method for modeling the offset is by use of
the ZOFFS field on the connection entry. Although the MID4 field may be used for this purpose,
it may produce ill -conditioned stiffness matrices (negative terms on factor diagonal) if done
incorrectly.
•Only one of the options MID4 or ZOFFS should be used; if both methods are specified the effects
are cumulative. Since this is probably not what the user intends, this may results in unexpected
answers. Note that the mass properties are not modified to reflect the existence of the offset when
the ZOFFS and MID4 methods are used. If the weight or mass properties of an offset plate are to
be used in an analysis, the RBAR method must be used to represent the offset. See Shell Elements
(CTRIA3 , CTRIA6 , CTRIAR , CQUAD4 , CQUAD8 , CQUADR ) in the MSC Nastran Reference Guide .
•The effects of MID4 are not considered in the calculation of differential stiffness. Therefore, it is
recommended that MID4 be left blank in buckling analysis.
7.This entry is referenced by the CTRIA3, CTRIA6, CTRIAR, CQUAD4, CQUAD8, and CQUADR
entries via PID.
8.For structural problems, MIDi must reference a MAT1, MAT2, or MAT8 material property entryMAT2 entries with any GEij are called extended  MAT2 entries. The damping is computed for such
a material as Gij = Gij * GEij where Gij are the elastic material coefficients on the parent MAT2
entry. An element structural damping matrix is then generate d using these scaled Gij.
Any PSHELL with an extended  MAT2 in the M ID1 field assumes that every MID 2 and MID 4
present will perform s a Gij = Gij * GEij calculation to form the appropriate structural damping
matrix. The MID3 calculation is of the form J11 = J11 * GE11, J12 = J12 * GE12, and J22 = J22&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GE22.
1 For the case where MID1 is extended  (is a reference to a MAT2 with GEij defined) b ut
MID2, MID3, and/or MID4 c ontain a MAT1, a non-extended  MAT2 , or a MAT8 entry
the calculation is of the form Gij = Gij * GE where GE is the structural damping
coefficient of the associated MAT1, MAT2, or MAT8 entry.
2 For the case where MID1 is a MAT1, a non-extended  MAT2 , or a MAT8, b ut any one of
the M ID2, MID3 , or MID4 fields have extended  MAT2 entries , the structural damping
coefficient GE of the MATi entry is used to simply scale the element stiffness as K4 matrix
contribution  ? GE * K.
3 For case two (2)  above, the user has the option of using PARAM, SHLDAMP , DIFF in
which case any MID2, MID3, or MID4 c ontaining an extended  MAT2 entry force the
use or the extended fields. HOWEVER, remember the PARAM, SHLDAMP , DIFF is
global – meaning EVERY PSHELL scales e ach of its MIDi material by the appropriate
GEij or GE to form an element structural damping matrix.PSHELL rules with extended MAT2 entries&lt;/li&gt;

9.If the transverse shear material MID3 or the membrane-bending coupling term MID4 references a
MAT2 entry, then G33 must be zero. If MID3 references a MAT8 entry, then G1Z and G2Z must
not be zero.
10. For heat transfer problems, MIDi must reference a MAT4 or MAT5 material property entry.
11. The default for Z1 is -T/2, and for Z2 is +T/2. T is the local plate thickness defined either by T on
this entry or by membrane thicknesses at connected grid points, if they are input on connection
entries.
12. For plane strain analysis, set MID2=-1 and set MID1 to reference a MAT1 entry. In-plane loads
applied to plain strain elements are interpreted as line-loads with a value equal to the load divided by
the thickness. Thus, if a thickness of “1.0” is used, the value of the line-load equals the load value.
Pressure can be approximated with multiple line loads where the pressure value equals the line-load
divided by the length between the loads.
13. For a material nonlinear property, MID1 must reference a MATS1 entry and be the same as MID2,
unless a plane strain (MID2 =-1) formulation is desired. Also, MID3 cannot reference a MATS1
entry.
14. If transverse shear flexibility is specified for a model with curved shells where the loading is dominated
by twist and shell normals are turned off (e.g., PARAM,SNORM,-1), then results may be inaccurate
and may diverge when the mesh is refined. PARAM,SNORM should be set for this unique model
condition.
15. For 3D contact analysis, MID2 must be non-zero and for 2D contact analysis, MID1 must be non-
zero.&lt;/p&gt;

8.NSM is not currently supported when this entry is used.
9.When this entry points to a PCOMP or a PCOMPG, special restrictions should be noted for some
of the PCOMP/PCOMPG entries:
•NSM, FT and GE are not supported. If a failure theory for any ply defined on the
PCOMP/PCOMG entry is required, a MATF entry should be specified for the associated
material.
•The allowable inter-laminar bond strength SB is supported. When used in conjunction with the
parabolic shear option (NLMOPTS, TSHEAR), the provided value of SB is used to calculate the
ply shear bond index for thick shells using the relation - Bond index = max(inter-laminar shear
stress)/SB.
•LAM=BLANK and LAM=SYM (only for PCOMP) are supported. No smearing i.e., conversion
of PCOMP/PCOMG into equivalent PSHELL is supported. Conventional integration through
the thickness and across all layers is used. LAM=MEM, BEND, SMEAR and SMCORE are
treated in a manner similar to LAM=BLANK, i.e., the sequence of the plies and the data given for
each ply is used to carry out the conventional thickness integration.
•SOUTi is not supported for individual plies. If STRESS output is requested for a particular shell
element, then integration point stresses and elastic strains in the material coordinate system for all
plies of the element are printed. If the parabolic shear option is used, then integration point values
of the inter-laminar stresses and the bond index are also printed.
•Layer Composite (PCOM/PCOMG) is not supported to CTRAI6 by PSHLN1.

&lt;p&gt;PSOLID
Properties of Solid Elements2620
Main Index
Defines the properties of solid elements (CHEXA, CPENTA, CPYRAM  and CTETRA entries).
Format:
Example:
Remarks:
1.PSOLID is a primary property entry. Primary property entries are grouping entities for many
applications in MSC Nastran. Therefore it is highly recommended that the PSOLID property entries
have unique identification numbers with respect to all other property entries else unexpected
grouping results may occur. There must be uniqueness between PSOLID, PCOMPLS entries.
2.Isotropic (MAT1 or MAT4), anisotropic (MAT5 or MAT9), or fluid (MAT10) material properties
may be referenced. If FCTN =“PFLUID” or “FFLUID”, then MID must reference a MAT10 entry.

&lt;p&gt;2621 PSOLID
Properties of Solid Elements
Main Index
3.See the CHEXA, CPENTA, or CTETRA entry for the definition of the element coordinate systems.
The material coordinate system (CORDM) may be the basic system (0 or blank), any defined system
(Integer &amp;gt; 0), or the standard internal coordinate system of the element based on eigenvalue
techniques to insure non bias in the element formulation designated as element coordinate system
(-1) or the element system (-2). The default value for CORDM is zero unless it is overridden by the
NASTRAN statement with the CORDM keyword. When MAT9 entry is used, the coordinate
system used effects the stiffness calculation of the element.
4.For CPYRAM, CORDM=0 or blank is treated as basic coordinate system, CORDM=-1 is not
supported and causes Nastran to issue UFM, and CORDM=-2 is treated as element system explained
in CPYRAM Remark 4.
5.Advanced nonlinear solid elements identified through an additional PSLDN1 entry, or
SPROPMAP &amp;gt; -1 in NLMOPTS, or IDAMP&amp;gt;0 in NLSTEP, and so on, in SOL 400 do not support:
IN, ISOP, and FCTN. Also, in this case, CORDM=-1 is only supported for CHEXA elements. Fatal
error is issued if CORDM = -1 is used for CPENTA, CPYRAM and CTETRA.
The following Remarks, DO NOT APPLY TO SOL 700.
6.For CHEXA and CPENTA elements with no midside nodes, reduced shear integration with bubble
functions (ISOP =blank or “REDUCED” and IN =blank or “BUBBLE”) is the default. This is
recommended because it minimizes shear locking and Poisson’s ratio locking and does not cause
modes of deformation that lead to no strain energy. The effects of using nondefault values are as
follows:
a.IN=“THREE” or 3 produces an overly stiff element.
b.If IN =“TWO” or 2 and the element has midside nodes, modes of deformation may occur that
lead to no strain energy.
c.Standard isoparametric integration (ISOP =“FULL” or 1 and IN =“TWO” or 2; or “THREE”
or 3) produces an element overly stiff in shear. This type of integration is more suited to
nonstructural problems.
d.In SOL105 the default reduced integration scheme often produces spurious modes in which case
it is recommended that ISOP=&amp;ldquo;FULL&amp;rdquo; and IN=&amp;ldquo;THREE&amp;rdquo; be used.
7.IN=“BUBBLE” is not allowed for CTETRA elements or for CHEXA and CPENTA elements with
midside nodes.
8.If you use IN = “BUBBLE” for CTETRA elements, NASTRAN internally switch to IN=2 if you have
4-noded CTETRA element and IN=3 greater than 4 nodes.
9.Stress output may be requested at the Gauss points (STRESS =“GAUSS” or 1) of linear C HEXA and
CPENTA elements (i.e. elements w ith no midside nodes ). Gauss point output is available for the
linear and quadratic C TETRA and CPYRAM elements  (i.e. elements with or without midside
nodes ).
10. The following tables indicate the allowed options and combination of options. If a combination not
found in the table is used, then a warning message will be issued and default values will be assigned
for all options.&lt;/p&gt;

Connector Element Property
Main Index
Remarks:
1.The material MID, the diameter D, and the length are used to calculate the stiffness of the connector
in 6 directions. MID can only refer to the MAT1 Bulk Data entry. The length is the distance of GA
to GB (see Figure 9-133).
Figure 9-133  Length and Diameter of the CWELD Connector
2.This remark is now valid only if &amp;ldquo;PARAM,OLDWELD,YES&amp;rdquo; is present. The parameter MSET is
active only for the formats ELEMID and GRIDID (see CWELD , 1533  for the format descriptions).
MSET =“OFF” incorporates constraints at the element stiffness matrix level avoiding explicit m-set
constraint equations. For the formats PARTPAT and ELPAT, constraints are always eliminated on
the element level. MSET =“ON” generates explicit m-set constraints. For example, if a patch-to-

MSET=ON is specified, 2x6 explicit constraints are generated that connect the 6 degrees-of-freedom
of GA to the translational degrees-of-freedom of grid points GAi and the 6 degrees-of-freedom of GB
to GBi. The 2x6 degrees-of-freedom of GA and GB are put into the m-set. The constraints are labeled
“RWELD”. The identification numbers of the generated RWELD constraint elements start with an
offset of 100,001,001 by default. The offset number can be changed with PARAM, OSWELM. For
MSET =“OFF” or blank, the 2x6 constraint equations are built into the stiffness matrix of the
CWELD element, thereby condensating the 2x6 degrees-of-freedom of GA and GB.
3.TYPE = &amp;ldquo;SPOT&amp;rdquo; is good for the formats PARTPAT, ELPAT, or ELEMID with patch to patch
connections. For point to patch connections or another formats of patch to patch connections, TYPE
is always set to blank.
If &amp;ldquo;PARAM,OLDWELD,YES&amp;rdquo; is present, the effective length for the stiffness of the CWELD
element is set to  regardless of the distance GA to GB.  and  are the

For the new CWELD, the locations of GA/GB (if GA/GB is not specified by the user or the
SWLDPRM parameter MOVGAB is equal to 1) will be adjusted so that the distance GA to GB is
equal to L = 1/2 · .
4.If TYPE=blank and &amp;ldquo;PARAM,OLDWELD,YES&amp;rdquo; is present, the effective length  of the CWELD
is equal to the true length L, the distance of GA to GB, as long as the ratio of the length L to diameter
D is in the range LDMIN &amp;lt; L/D &amp;lt; LDMAX. If L is below the range, the effective length is set to
and if L is above the range, the effective length is set to .
For the new CWELD with TYPE=blank, LDMIN and LDMAX are ignored. If the distance of GA
to GB (patch to patch connections) or GS to GA (point to patch connections) is less than 1.0e-4, the
locations of GA/GB (if GA/GB is not specified by the user or the SWLDPRM parameter MOVGAB
is equal to 1) will be adjusted so that the distance is equal to 1.0e- 4.
5.PWELD is a primary property entry. Primary property entries are grouping entities for many
applications in MSC Nastran. Therefore it is highly recommended that the PWELD property entries
have unique identification numbers with respect to all other property entries else unexpected
grouping results may occur. There must be uniqueness between PWELD entries.
6.The new CWELD will not contribute to MASS by default even if it&amp;rsquo;s associated MATi entry has a
non-zero density. To react to a non-zero density &amp;ldquo;SWLDPARM,WMASS,1&amp;rdquo; is required. If mass is
computed, the PARAM,COUPMASS effects the mass calculation.tAtB+

1.For the surfaces of an incomplete enclosure (view factors add up to less than 1.0), a complete
enclosure may be achieved (SUM = 1.0) by specifying an ambient element, ELEAMB.  When
multiple cavities are defined, each cavity must have a unique ambient element if ambient elements are
desired.  No elements can be shared between cavities.
2.Third -body shadowing is ignored in the cavity if SHADOW = “NO”.  In particular, if it is known a
priori that there is no third -body shadowing, SHADOW = NO overrides KSHD and KBSHD fields
on the VIEW Bulk Data entry as well as reduces the calculation time immensely.
3.The view factors for a complete enclosure may add up to slightly more than 1.0 due to calculation
inaccuracies.  SCALE can be used to adjust all the view factors proportionately to acquire a
summation equal to the value specified for SCALE.  If SCALE is left blank or set to 0.0, no scaling is
performed.
4.If the VIEW3D Bulk Data entry is not specified, the view factors are calculated using finite difference
and contour integration methods.  If NFECI =“FD”, then all view factors are calculated using the
finite difference technique.  NFECI = “CONT” invokes contour integration for all view factor
calculations.  If NFECI is blank, the program selects a method to use between any two particular
elements based on RMAX.
5.The comparison value for RMAX is equal to  where  is the area of a subelement and&lt;br&gt;
is the distance between two subelements r and s for which view factors are being computed.  When
NFECI is blank, the program selects the contour integral method only if .
6.When a number of elements are grouped together and considered as a conglomerate surface, view
factors can be calculated between these groups.  These are referred to as global view factors.  The SET1
Bulk Data entry is used to define the conglomerate.  When using this feature, negative EIDs are not
allowed.
7.If a RADLST and RADMTX entry exists for this cavity ID, new view factors are not computed and
the existing RADLST and RADMTX are used in the thermal analysis.
8.The VIEW3D Bulk Data entry must be specified for the calculation of axisymmetric view factors.
The process relies on the internal construction of a semi-circle of computational elements. NCOMP
specifies the number of such elements desired .NFECI Controls whether finite difference or contour integration methods are to be used in the
calculation of view factors in the absence of a VIEW3D Bulk Data entry.  (Character
= “FD” or “CONT”; See Remark 4. for default.)
RMAX Subelement area factor.  See Remark 5. (Real &amp;gt; 0.0; Default = 0.1)

Remarks:
1.A radiation EIDi list isolates those CHBDYi surface element faces that are to communicate in a
radiation enclosure.  View-factor calculation and RADMTX formation for an enclosure is performed
only for (or among) those faces identified within the same RADCAV.
2.A radiation exchange matrix (RADMTX) can only reference one radiative face list (RADLST).  The
companion RADCAV, RADLST, and RADMTX must share a unique ICAVITY.
3.For each EIDi, the appropriate CHBDYi element is located, and the proper RADM entry ID field
found.
4.If the radiation exchange matrix or any radiation boundary conditions are available from an external
source, the RADMTX must be user generated.RADLST Listing of Enclosure Radiation Faces

Defines a rigid bar with six degrees-of-freedom at each end.
For its usage in NLPERF SOL 400, refer to RBAR in the Ap.C: NLPERF SOL 400 .
Format:
Example:
Remarks:
1.Two methods are available to process rigid elements: equation elimination or Lagrange multipliers.
The Case Control command, RIGID, selects the method.
2.For the Lagrange method, Nastran will create the Lagrange multiplier degrees-of-freedom internally
in addition to the 12 displacement degrees-of-freedom given by grid points GA and GB. The number
of Lagrange multiplier degrees-of-freedom is equal to the number of dependent degrees-of-freedom.
3.For the linear method, the total number of components in CNA and CNB must equal six; for
example, CNA = 1236, CNB = 34. Furthermore, they must jointly be capable of representing any
general rigid body motion of the element. For the Lagrange method, the total number of components
must also be six. However, only CNA = 123456 or CNB = 123456 is allowed. If both CNA and CNB
are blank, then CNA =123456. For this method, RBAR1 gives the simpler input format.RBAR Rigid Bar

4.If both CMA and CMB are zero or blank, all of the degrees-of-freedom not in CNA and CNB will
be made dependent. For the linear method, the dependent degrees-of-freedom will be made members
of the m-set. For the Lagrange method, they may or may not be member of the m-set, depending on
the method selected in the RIGID Case Control command. However, the rules regarding the m-set
described below apply to both methods.
5.The m -set coordinates specified on this entry may not be specified on other entries that define
mutually exclusive sets.  See Degree-of-Freedom Sets  for a list of these entries.
6.Element identification numbers should be unique with respect to all other element identification
numbers.
7.RBAR, among other eligible rigid element types, can be selected via MPC and SET3.
8.Forces of multipoint constraint may be recovered in all solution sequences, except SOL 129, with the
MPCFORCE Case Control command.
9.Rigid elements are ignored in heat transfer problems. If used in a multi-physics coupled problem
using SUBSTEP, they participate in the mechanical substep but are ignored in the heat transfer
subsstep through automatic deactivation. For more information on deactivation, see the DEACTEL
keyword under the NLMOPTS Bulk Data entry and the associated Remark 10. for that entry.
10. See Rigid Elements and Multipoint Constraints (R -type, MPC)  in the MSC Nastran Reference Guide for a
discussion of rigid elements.
11. For the Lagrange method, the thermal expansion effect will be computed for the rigid bar element if
user supplies the thermal expansion coefficient ALPHA, and the thermal load is requested by the
TEMPERATURE(INITIAL) and TEMPERATURE(LOAD) Case Control commands. The
temperature of the element is taken as the average temperature of the two connected grid points GA
and GB .
12. When there is large rotation, CMA and CMB must have all “456” if any rotational degrees of freedom
is used.
13. Fluid Grids (Identified by a -1 in the CD field of the GRID entry) do not support the use of Rigid
elements, use MPC entries.&lt;/p&gt;

3.RBAR1 is a preferred input format to define the Lagrange method for a rigid bar.
4.When CB = “123456” or blank, the grid point GB is constrained to move with GA as a rigid bar. For
default CB = “123456”. Any number of degrees-of-freedom at grid point GB can be released not to
move with the rigid body.
5.For the Lagrange method, the theory is formulated such that a consistent rigid body motion for grid
points GA and GB will be computed even if these two points have different global coordinate systems.
6.For the Lagrange method, the thermal expansion effect will be computed for the rigid bar element if
user supplies the thermal expansion coefficient ALPHA, and the thermal load is requested by the
TEMPERATURE(INITIAL) and TEMPERATURE(LOAD) Case Control commands. The

&lt;p&gt;RBE2
Rigid Body Element, Form 22666
Main Index
Defines a rigid body with independent degrees-of-freedom that are specified at a single grid point and with
dependent degrees-of-freedom that are specified at an arbitrary number of grid points.
Format:
Example:
Remarks:
1.Two methods are available to process rigid elements: equation elimination or Lagrange multipliers.
The Case Control command, RIGID, selects the method.
2.For the Lagrange method, Nastran will create internally the Lagrange multiplier degrees-of-freedom
in addition to the displacement degrees-of-freedom given by connected grid points. The number of
Lagrange multiplier degrees-of-freedom is equal to the number of dependent degrees-of-freedom
which is obtained by CM multiplied with the number of dependent grid points.
3.For the linear method, the dependent degrees-of-freedom indicated by CM will be made members of
the m-set at all grid points. For the Lagrange method, they may or may not be members of the m-set,
depending on the method selected on the RIGID Case Control command. However, the rules
regarding the m-set described below apply to both types of methods.
4.Dependent degrees-of-freedom assigned by one rigid element may not also be assigned dependent by
another rigid element or by a multipoint constraint.RBE2 Rigid Body Element, Form 2

mutually exclusive sets.  See Degree-of-Freedom Sets  for a list  of these entries.
11. For the Lagrange method, the thermal expansion effect will be computed, if user supplies the thermal

Main Index
1.Element ID numbers must be unique with respect to all other element ID numbers.
2.This entry will internally define a RBE2 element with the same ID of the RBE2GS entry. The grid
assigned to GN will always be the independent grid. GM will be the dependent grid. If GS is a
‘POINT’ entry (or GS is blank and XYZ is specified), the first two grids that fall within the search
radius  about GS (or XYZ) will be chosen as GN and GM. The closest to the search location will
be the independent grid GN the next closest will be the dependent grid GM. Any grids contained in
a GNi list will be excluded from the GN search and any grids contained in a GMj list will be excluded
from the GM search. After GN and GM have been determined (with or without use of the exclusion
lists for GNi and GMj (and if TYPE =‘NMFLIP’, then GN and GM will be reversed.
If GS is ‘GRID’ entry, and is part of the physical model, i.e., it has physical structural elements
attached to it, it will become GN the independent grid for the RBE2 to be generated. If it is in the
GNi exclusion list, the next closest grid will be chosen. the closest grid within the search radius about
GN will be chosen as GM, the dependent grid. Any grids contained in a GNi list will be
excluded from the GN search and any grids contained in a GMj list will be excluded from the GM
search. After GN and GM have been determined (with our without use of the exclusion lists for GNi
and GMj) and if TYPE =‘NMFLIP’, then GN and GM will be reversed.
If GS is a ‘GRID’ entry, and is determined not to be part of the physical model, the first two grids
that fall within the search radius  about GS (or XYZ) will be chosen as GN and GM. The closest
to the search location will be the independent grid, GN, the next closest will be the dependent grid,
GM. Any grids contained in a GNi list will be excluded from the GN search and any grids contained
in a GMj list will be excluded from the GM search. After GN and GM have been determined (with
or without use of the exclusion lists for GNi and GMj) and if TYPE=‘NMFLIP’, then GN and GM NMFLIP The independent and dependent DOF’s are interchanged.

will be reversed. The GS grid will remain on the GEOM1 table for post-processing viewing purposes,
but will not be part of the Nastran solution g-set. If TYPE=‘IIRBE2’, the two grids chosen for the
RBE2 will be the independent GN’s of existing RBE2 elements whose independent grids lie within
the search radius. If TYPE=‘NMIIRB2’, then GN and GM will be reversed. If no existing RBE2
elements have independent grids within the search radius or if only one existing RBE2 has an
independent grid within the search radius, then a fatal message will be issued. POINT and GRID
entries must be unique with respect to all other POINT and GRID entries. If TYPE=‘IIRB2’, it is
recommended that PARAM,AUTOMSET,YES be used in the analysis run.
3.If , the two located grids GN and GM will be made coincident to the GS (or XYZ) location.
4.If CM is 123456 and GM is touching only solid elements, CM will be internally changed to 123. For
solid elements, the grids GN and GM should always be coincident.
5.When Module GP4 is run, checks are made to insure that the selected grids, GN and GM, do not
violate existing constraint sets. If a violation occurs a fatal message will be issued for the offending
grids. These grids can be excluded from further search inclusion by specifying them on the GNi or
GMj list. PARAM,AUTOMSET,YES will often prevent any violation.
6.If GS=0 or blank and XS, YX, ZS is not specified or if both GS and XS, YS, ZS are specified a fatal
error will occur.
7.The end of a grid exclusion lists is indicated by the existence of “ “ in the field following the last
entry in the list. In the “thru” option, not all grids in the range need exist.
8.For superelement or part superelement connection the independent grid assigned to GN will be
exterior to the superelement. The dependent grid GM will be an interior grid to the superelement. If
the resulting RBE2 element, connects two different superelements, the element will be assigned to the
superelement with the lower ID and the grid attached to the superelement with the higher ID will be
moved to the superelement with the lower ID.
9.If the RBE2GS is listed on a SEELT entry, it will be placed as the SEELT directs. If say grid G1 lies
in another superelement and G2 lies in the SEELT superelement, G1 will be moved to the SEELT
defined superelement.
10. “THRU” should not be the first nonblank field of a continuation line. Blank fields are allowed in the
exclusion lists for readability.
11. Use PARAM,SEP1XOVR,16 to print the grids found by each RBE2GS entry.
12. RBE2GS is not supported in the presence of part (BEGIN SUPER) superelements .
13. For the Lagrange method, the thermal expansion effect will be computed, if user supplies the thermal
expansion coefficient ALPHA, and the thermal load is requested by the TEMPERATURE(INITIAL)
and TEMPERATURE(LOAD) Case Control commands. The average temperature of the connected
grid points is used as the temperature of the rigid body element. In this case, for the Lagrange method,
PARAM, BAILOUT, -1 is activated within the solver.
14. Fluid Grids (Identified by a -1 in the CD field of the GRID entry) do not support the use of Rigid
elements, use MPC entries.R0

Interpolation Constraint Element2672
Main Index
Remarks:
1.Two methods are available to process rigid elements: equation elimination or Lagrange multipliers.
The Case Control command, RIGID, selects the method.
2.For the Lagrange method, the REFC must be “123”, “456”, or “123456”. No other combination is
allowed.
3.For the Lagrange method, Nastran will create internally the Lagrange multiplier degrees-of-freedom
in addition to the displacement degrees-of-freedom given by connected grid points. The number of
Lagrange multiplier degrees-of-freedom is equal to the number of degrees-of-freedom given by
REFC.
4.For the linear method, the dependent degrees-of-freedom indicated by REFC will be made members
of the m-set. For Lagrange rigid element, they may or may not be members of the m-set, depending
on the method selected on the RIGID Case Control command. However, the rules regarding the m-
set described below apply to both types of methods.
5.We recommend that for most applications only the translation components 123 be used for Ci. An
exception is the case where the Gi,j are collinear . A rotation component may then be added to one
grid point to stabilize its associated rigid body mode for the element.
6.Blank spaces may be left at the end of a Gi,j sequence.
7.For the Lagrange method, the default for “UM” must be used. For the linear method, the default for
“UM” should be used except in cases where the user wishes to include some or all REFC components
in displacement sets exclusive from the m -set. If the default is not used for “UM”:
•The total number of components in the m -set (i.e., the total number of dependent degrees-of-
freedom defined by the element) must be equal to the number of components in REFC (four
components in the example).
•The components specified after “UM” must be a subset of the components specified under REFC
and (Gi,j, Ci).
•The m-rows by m-columns partition [Rm,m] of the global stiffness containing the dependent
degrees-of-freedom of multipoint constraints and rigid elements must be nonsingular.
PARAM,CHECKOUT in SOLs 101 through 200 may be used to check for this condition. For
some complex constraints, forming a well-conditioned [Rm,m] is difficult for a user to perform
manually and PARAM,AUTOMSET,YES will automatically determine a well-conditioned
partition by employing a rectangular decomposition of the [Rm,g] matrix.
8.Dependent degrees-of-freedom assigned by one rigid element may not also be assigned dependent by
another rigid element or by a multipoint constraint.CMi Component numbers of GMi to be assigned to the m -set. (Any of the Integers 1

&lt;p&gt;2673 RBE3
Interpolation Constraint Element
Main Index
9.RBE3, among other eligible rigid element types, can be selected via MPC and SET3.
10. Forces of multipoint constraint may be recovered in all solution sequences, except SOL 129, with the
MPCFORCE Case Control command.
11. Rigid elements are ignored in heat transfer problems. If used in a multi-physics coupled problem
using SUBSTEP, they participate in the mechanical substep but are ignored in the heat transfer
subsstep through automatic deactivation. For more information on deactivation, see the DEACTEL
keyword under the NLMOPTS Bulk Data entry and the associated Remark 10. for that entry.
12. The m -set coordinates specified on this entry may not be specified on other entries that define
mutually exclusive sets. See Degree-of-Freedom Sets  for a list of these entries.
13. The formulation for the RBE3 element was changed in Version 70.7. This change allowed the
element to give consistent answers that are not dependent upon the units of the model. Only models
that connected rotation degrees-of-freedom for Ci were affected. Note that these models are ignoring
the recommendation in Remark 5. The formulation prior to Version 70.7 may be obtained by setting
SYSTEM(310)=1.
14. For the Lagrange method, the thermal expansion effect will be computed, if user supplies the thermal
expansion coefficient ALPHA, and the thermal load is requested by the TEMPERATURE(INITIAL)
and TEMPERATURE(LOAD) Case Control commands. The average temperature of the connected
grid points is used as the temperature of the rigid body element. In this case, for the Lagrange method,
PARAM, BAILOUT, -1 is activated within the solver .
15. Fluid Grids (Identified by a -1 in the CD field of the GRID entry) do not support the use of Rigid
elements, use MPC entries.
16. When using the Case Control comment RIGID=LGELIM or RIGID=LAGRAN in appropriate
linear solution sequences or for the default RIGID=LAGRAN in SOL400, if the number of weighted
grids Gi,j gets large and/or some of the weighted grids Gi,j are at a large distance from the reference
GRID, the RBE3 constraint may not be fully enforced  because some of the weighted grids listed on
the RBE3 entry may not actually contribute to the constraint.
This occurs, because terms in the displacement gradient matrix have fallen below a threshold value.
If this occurs, it is recommended that the Bulk Data entry MDLPRM, LRGDHFLT,
(default=1.0E-10) be set to a smaller tolerance of say, 1.0E-14 or 1.0E-15.
A large number of Gi,j is, say Gi,j &amp;gt; 3700 grids.
If Lmodel  is a significant characteristic length of the model and Lc is a significant characteristic distance
of Gi,j from the reference grid, then Lc / Lmodel  &amp;gt; .29 might be considered a large distance from the
reference grid.&lt;/p&gt;

TYPE=REVOLUTE, Both nodal pairs (1,2) and (3,4) are constrained to remain
coincident. Consequently, the relative motion of these rigid bodies is restricted to
rotations about the line segment formed by the two pairs of coincident nodes. This
segment is labeled the &amp;ldquo;centerline&amp;rdquo;.
TYPE=CYLIND (cylindrical), This joint is derived from the rotational joint by
relaxing the constraints along the centerline. This joint admits relative rotation and
translation along the centerline.

constraints normal to the centerline. Relatively displacements along the direction of
the centerline are excluded. Describer Meaning

TYPE=UNIVERS (universal joint), In contrast with the preceding joints, nodal pairs
(1,2) and (3,4) are not initially coincident. Rather, the segments formed by (1,3) and
(2,4) must be orthogonal; and they serve as axes about which the two bodies may
undergo relative rotation. The universal joint excludes all other relative motion and the
axes remain orthogonal at all time.

centerline nodes which restrict rotation. Aside from translation along the centerline the
two rigid bodies are stuck together.

Rigid Connection2678
Main Index
Remarks
1.The RCONN entry can be used to define three types of connection :
a.Two Surfaces Tied Together.
b.Define secondary a nd primary s egments representing the two surfaces to be tied together. There
should not be a gap between the two sets of segments. The two surfaces are tied together during
the analysis.
c.Grid Points Tied to a Surface.
d.If STYPE is set to GRID and OPTION is set to NORMAL, the secondary e ntities comprise
discrete grid points that are tied to the primary s urface during the analysis. The grid points must
lie on the surface.
e.Shell Edge Tied to a Shell Surface.
f.If STYPE is set to GRID and OPTION is set to SHELL, the edges of shell or beams elements can
be tied to the faces of other shells. The grid points attached to the edge of the shells/beams must
be selected as the secondary g rid points. The shell surface to which they are tied must be selected
as the primary s urface. The two sets will then be tied together throughout the analysis. All degrees
of freedom will be coupled.
2.The CLSGAP entry enables you to define two different meshes that are not coincident over the
primary/secondary i nterface. If the option is set to YES, the secondary s urface becomes coincident
(according to projections) with the primary s urface.
3.The search method of the contact algorithm is used to find the closest primary f ace. The tolerance
defined with the GAPDIS/GAPDISV fields is similar to the monitoring distance defined on the
CONTACT entry with the MONDIS/ MONDISV fields.
4.The use of the gap closing CLSGAP can cause an element to collapse. This may happen if the
GAPDISV tolerance is set to a value greater than the length of the side of an element.
5.When a solid and a shell mesh are tied together, the rotational degrees of freedom of the shell grid
points are not coupled.
6.When OPTION=SHELL and CLSGAP=NO, the time step scale factor will be set to 0.4. This can
be overwritten by:
PARAM*, STEPFCTRCONN, xxxGAPDIS Defines the tolerance used in the search for a primary f ace. If the distance between a
secondary p oint and a primary f ace falls within this tolerance, the primary f ace is

If anyone of RTYPE1 or RTYPE2 is blank, then the default is the one same as the other field.
3.For elements, the item code COMPi represents a component of the element stress, strain, and force
and is described in Tables Element Stress-Strain Item Codes  and Element Force Item Codes Part 1 . For an item
having both a real and imaginary part, the code of the real part must be selected. This is required for
computing both the cross-power spectral density function and cross-correlation function.
For grid point, the item code is one of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, which represent the mnemonics T1, T2,
T3, R1, R2, and R3, respectively. For scalar point, always use 1.

Remarks:
1.The forces that are created with the RFORCE entry act on the structure as follows: the forces that are
defined with the RFORCE entry for a constant angular velocity (A), act in the positive radial
direction. These forces represent the inertia forces on the structure due to a constant angular velocity.
The forces that are defined with the RFORCE entry for a constant angular acceleration (RACC), act
in the same direction as the angular acceleration. These forces would be opposite to the inertia forces
on the structure due to a constant angular acceleration. In Figure 9-134, the force vector at grid point

2.In the static solution sequences, SID must be selected by the LOAD Case Control command.
In the dynamic solution sequences, if there is a LOADSET Case Control command, then SID must
be referenced in the LID field of a selected LSEQ entry.  If there is no LOADSET Case Control
command, then SID must be referenced in the EXCITEID field of an RLOADi or TLOADi entry.
3.G = 0 signifies that the rotation vector acts through the origin of the basic coordinate system.
4.CID = 0 (Default) signifies that the rotation vector is defined in the basic coordinate system.

6.METHOD =1 yields correct results only when there is no coupling in the mass matrix.  This occurs
when the lumped mass option is used with or without the ZOFFS option (see the CQUAD4 entry
for a description of ZOFFS).  METHOD =2 yields correct results for lumped or consistent mass
matrix only if the ZOFFS option is not used.  The acceleration terms due to the mass offset (X1, X2,
X3) on the CONM2 entry are not computed with METHOD =2.  All the possible combinations of
mass matrices and offset and the correct method to be used are shown below.
7.In cyclic symmetry analyses, the T3 axis of the basic coordinate system must be coincident with the
axis of symmetry. In the DIH type of cyclic symmetry, the T1 axis also must be parallel to side 1 of
segment 1R of the model.
8.For superelement analysis, G should reference a residual structure point that is exterior to all
superelements when loading Superelement 0 and a separate G must be interior to each superelement
when loading an upstream superelement else centrifugal loads will not be generated for that
superelement. However, in cyclic analysis, User Fatal Message 4347 will be issued.
9.In a geometric nonlinear static analysis (SOL 106 and 400 when PARAM LDGISP is set to +1), this
type of loading is a follower force type of loading. However, the orientation of coordinate system CID
is not updated.
10. In nonlinear static solutions when there is more than one increment (INC) specified on the
NLPARM entry for a given subcase, the load vector resulting from the RFORCE input (and not the
angular velocity vector) is scaled linearly.  This means that loading by increments in the angular
velocity can only be achieved by having subcases where the RFORCE loading is applied in a single
increment.
11. The continuation entry is optional.
12. Forces due to angular acceleration (RACC) are computed with METHOD =2 even if
METHOD =1 is specified.
13. Loads derived from this entry do not include effects due to mass specified for scalar points.
14. The follower force effects due to loads from this entry are included in the stiffness in all linear solution
sequences that calculate a differential stiffness. The solution sequences are SOLs 103, 105, 107 to
112, 115 and 116 (see also the parameter FOLLOWK  (Ch. 6)). In addition, follower force effects are
included in the force balance in the nonlinear solution sequences, SOLs 106, 129, 153, 159 and 400,
if geometric nonlinear effects are turned on with PARAM,LGDISP,1. The follower force stiffness is
included in the nonlinear static solution sequences (SOLs 106, 153 and 400) and general nonlinear
solution sequence (SOL 400) for both ANALYSIS=NLSTAT and NLTRAN but not in the nonlinear
transient dynamic solution sequences (SOLs 129 and 159). No Offset Offset

15. The coordinate systems in the main Bulk Data Section are defined relative to the assembly basic
coordinate system which is fixed.  This feature is useful when a superelement defined by a partitioned
Bulk Data Section is rotated or mirrored and the gravity load is more conveniently defined in terms
of coordinates which are fixed.
16. If CID is not a rectangular coordinate system, RFORCE will treat it as if it were and unexpected
answers may result.
17. Follower force stiffness (param,followk,yes) is supported for method 2 only.
18. Multiple RFORCE entries with different SID’s may be  used in S OL 400 in the same loadcase (STEP
and/or SUBCASE). They should be combined using the LOAD entry similar to the way FORCE or
PLOAD4 with different ID’s are combined.
19. Fields CID, METHOD, RACC, MB and IDRF will be ignored for SOL 700.
20. For Axisymmetric Harmonic elements, (elements selected with PAXSYMH entry), METHOD=2 is
required. A selection of METHOD=1 will automatically be overridden and be replaced by
METHOD=2 for all elements of the model.
21. Note that the LOAD entry scaling for RFORCE uses the square root of the absolute S×Si in rotor
dynamics. Thus it is recommended that the LOAD entry not be used with RFORCE in rotor
dynamics with a value other than S=1.0 and Si=1.0 value. See Remark 6. of the LOAD entry.
22. If Modules are present then this entry may only be specified in the main Bulk Data section.&lt;/p&gt;

Rotordynamic Analysis Parameters2692
Main Index
Remarks:
1.Multiple RGYRO entries with the same RID value are allowed. All RGYROs with same RID will be
analyzed for either SYNC (or) ASYNC option only.
2.For multiple RGYRO with same RID entries, reference rotors ID specified in REFROTR (4th) field
are treated as individual rotors. Non-reference rotors (rotor ID not defined in RGYRO) will need
REFROT (or) REFRTSE bulk data card to identify its reference rotor.
3.If single RGYRO entry with RID is used, then all rotors in the models will reference the rotor id
specified in REFROTR (4th) field.
4.The required information on the RGYRO entries varies for different analyses. Values for the RID and
SPDUNIT fields are always required. Values for SPDLOW, SPDHIGH and SPEED are analysis
dependent as shown in the table below:
a.The relative rotor speeds will be treated as linearly dependent on the reference rotor speed
( = A0 + A1 reference ). The scale factors A0 and A1 will be determined by a least-mean-square
fit of the relative rotor speeds input on the RSPINR entries between SPDLOW and SPDHIGH
of the reference rot or. If SPDLOW or SPDHIGH are outside the range specified on the RSPINR
entry, the values will be extrapolated from the RSPINR entry values.
b.Parameters (WR3, WR4 and WRH), RSPINR/RSPINT (WR3R, WR4R and WRHR), and
RGYRO (WR3WRL, WR4WRL and WRHWRL) are required for rotor damping under
different conditions.
5.For static analysis, the SYNCFLG field must be left blank or must have the ASYNC option specified
in it. Otherwi se, the program terminates the execution with an appropriate fatal message.
6.When there is a Case Control request for Campbell diagram, the selected RGYRO Bulk Data entry
must have the ASYNC option specified in its SYNCFLG field. Otherwise, the program terminates
the execution with an appropriate fatal message.
7.In the presence of GR field, the rotor damping matrix (BR) in complex eigenvalue analysis is given by:
BR= KR .GR/|Ω(Ω_ref)–WR3WRL|
where  KR is the rotor stiffness matrix.Solution

9.WR3WRL/ WR3WRL/ WRHWRL affect both the rotor damping terms and the circulation terms.
For the fixed reference frame, the circulation terms are generated from the rotating structure. For the
rotating reference frame, the circulation terms are generated from the stator.
10. The units of WR3WRL, WR4WRL, and WRHWRL are radians per unit time.

2.For the Lagrange method, Nastran will create internally the Lagrange multiplier degrees-of-freedom
in addition to the 12 displacement degrees-of-freedom given by grid points GA and GB. The number
of Lagrange multiplier degrees-of-freedom is equal to the number of dependent degrees-of-freedom
given by CB.
3.The length between grid points GA and GB must be zero.
4.When CB = “123456” or blank, the grid point GB is constrained to move with GA and the two grid
points moves as a single point. For default CB = “123456”.
5.If any degree-of-freedom is released on CB, RJOINT becomes a mechanical joint element. For
example, CB = “12345”, then RJOINT becomes a hinge. CB = “1234”, then RJOINT becomes a
universal joint. And CB = “123”, RJOINT becomes a spherical joint.
6.For the Lagrange method, the theory for the RJOINT is formulated such that a consistent mechanical
joint is created even if the user requests different global coordinate systems at grid points GA and GB.
7.Thermal expansion effect is not applicable for the RJOINT element, since the distance between grid
points GA and GB is zero.
8.Element identification numbers should be unique with respect to all other element identification
numbers.RJOINT Rigid Joint

&lt;p&gt;2705 ROTBENT
Define kinks and offsets to be applied on a rotor, pull the rotor on to its bearing and then carry out rotordynamic analysis (SOL 400 only).
Main Index
5.In a ROTBENT bulk data card, the keywords (Kink, Offset, or Brgdpr) can only be defined once.
Multiple rows for each keyword are allowed, except for Unbcord.
6.ROTBENT can take only one set of &amp;lsquo;Unbcord&amp;rsquo; input, with three REAL values. The first 2 grids in
AXIS option of ROTOR entry determine the X-axis of the Rotor system, with origin of this system
to be at the first grid entry in AXIS option. Unbcord entries will form the vector used to determine
the X-Y plane of Rotor system, defined using the CD of the first grid on AXIS option of ROTOR
entry linked to the Rotor ID.
7.A rectangular coordinate (rotor system) formed in remark  6., is used to determine the phase angle,
which starts from the X-Y plane based on UNBCORD, and the kink angle, which rotates about Z-
axis. In the following figures in the Rotor system, the rotor axis is X, and X-Y plane is determined by
the Unbcord vector.
8.Kink is calculated in the rotor system X-Y plane, where the phase is zero (See Remark 7.), by rotating
the shaft at the station point about Z-axis to the defined kink angle, then the Kink shaft is rotated
about the shaft axis (X) to the defined phase angle from the X-Y plane.
9.Offset is calculated in the rotor X-Y plane, where the phase is zero (See. Remark 7.) then the Offset
is rotated about the shaft axis (X) to the defined phase angle from the X-Y plane and applied to the
rotor.
10. Offsets and Kinks are calculated separately at the shaft axis or the shaft center line. All the Kinks and
Offsets are then accumulated to generate the initial unconstrained rotor geometry. Grid coordinate
of unconstrained rotor will be printed out in f06 file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ROTBENT
Define kinks and offsets to be applied on a rotor, pull the rotor on to its bearing and then carry out rotordynamic analysis (SOL 400 only).2706
Main Index
11. Brgdpr entry needs at least one pair of existing GRID IDs. First id of the pair of entries of Brgdpr
keyword should be part of referenced rotor and second id should be part of bearing (stator) connected
to the rotor. All the first grid ids of each pair of entry should be added to AXIS option of reference
ROTOR. It is recommended that both grid ids should not be part of any MPC, RBEs definition.
12. The initial step (NLSTATIC) updates the rotor geometry, writes the bulk data (program internally
created MPC, SPOINTs, SPC1 and SPCD) entries to pull the rotor into the bearings and runs the
static solution. This static solution step will result in the deformed shape of the model with the rotor
pulled into the bearings. At this point, the rotor and bearing GRIDs of Brgdpr entry are coincident.
13. It is advised to have both grid entries of Brgdpr keyword to be at the same axial location. A small Kink
angle is assumed (&amp;lt;1 deg) and the deformation in axial direction (axial and angular displacement) of
the rotor grids is ignored.
14. The following figures are the brief description of the Kinks and Offsets in a rotor, where B1 and B2
are support locations and are paired with rotor grids in Brgdpr keyword.&lt;/p&gt;

3.Current limitation for analysis in fixed reference frame:
a.If shell elements are defined perpendicular to the rotor axis for a 3D rotor defined using ROTOR
entry, then gyroscopic matrix is not available for those elements. For example, a flat disk like CD
spinning about the center. If the shell elements are replaced by SOLID elements, then correct
gyroscopic effects can be obtained.
b.Bar elements (default version) do not have polar moment of inertia. Thus, if CBAR elements are
defined along the axis of rotation (for both ROTOR and ROTORG entries), then they do not
provide any contribution to gyroscopic matrix. The CABR elements can be replaced by CBEAM
elements in case gyroscopic terms are needed for those elements.
4.THRU option is supported in ROTOR entry. Note that the order is important for LTYPE. In case
both ELEM and PROP are specified, ELEM should be specified first.
5.Analysis can be performed using coupled mass or diagonal mass for all the elements.
6.ROTORAX, ROTORG and ROTORSE should not be used along with ROTOR in ROT frame.
They can only be used with ROTOR in FIX frame. (since ROTORAX, ROTORG and ROTORSE
assume fixed reference frame.)
7.At least 2 grid points need to be defined on AXIS to complete ROTOR definition, these points may
or may n ot be a part of rotor.
8.For unbalance loads , the grid point  at which UNBALNC is defined, should be part of ROTOR AXIS
list.
9.In order to include CONM1/2 elements as part of a rotor, its element ID should be listed using
ELEM in ROTOR definition.&lt;br&gt;
10. Stator portion of the model should only be defined in residual for external superelement runs in

defined along the axis of rotation (for both ROTOR and ROTORG entries), then they do not
provide any contribution to gyroscopic matrix. The CABR elements can be replaced by CBEAM
elements in case gyroscopic terms are needed for those elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ROTORSE
Rotor Superelement Identification2714
Main Index
Specifies grids that compose the rotor line model. An alternate to the ROTORG entry when superelements
are used.
Format:
Example:
Remarks:
1.ROTORIDs of ROTORSE entries may not be the same as the ROTORIDs of ROTORAX entries
or ROTORG entries.
2.A ROTORSE entry can be used when the rotor is placed in a superelement.
3.The rotor line model may be the boundary of a 3D rotor superelement or the rotor line model may
be a superelement itself. SEOPT is chosen to distinguish between these cases. The options are:
1- If the user has a 3D model of the rotor and places it in a superelement with SEID, the boundary
(a-set) of this superelement must consist of no more and no less than the collinear rotor line model.
This will be checked. Specify SEOPT as 1 to identify this configuration. When this option is used,
the A-set matrices of the superelement are used to calculate the gyroscopic terms. This option should
be used for external superelements.
2- If the user has a line model of the rotor and places it in a superelement with SEID, this
superelement (g-set) may be partially or completely reduced in the SE reduction process. This
superelement must consist of no more and no less than the rotor line model. Specify SEOPT as 2 to
identify this configuration. When this option is used, the G-set matrices of the superelement are used
to calculate the gyroscopic terms.
4.Rotors specified using the ROTORSE entry can be connected directly to the support structure. In
contrast, rotors specified using the ROTORG entry must employ rigid elements to keep the rotor
disconnected from the support in the G-set of the residual structure.
5.Static and component mode reduction of the rotor line model are supported when using ROTORSE
entries.ROTORSE Rotor Superelement Identification

Rigid Pin -Ended Element Connection
Main Index
Defines a pin-ended element that is rigid in translation.
Format:
Example:
Remarks:
1.Two methods are available to process rigid elements: equation elimination or Lagrange multipliers.
The Case Control command, RIGID, selects the method.
2.For the Lagrange method, Nastran will create internally one Lagrange multiplier degree-of-freedom
in addition to the displacement degrees-of-freedom given by connected grid points.
3.For the Lagrange method, if both CMA and CMB are blanks, Nastran will compute the best degree-
of-freedom for the dependent degree-of-freedom.
4.The m -set coordinates specified on this entry may not be specified on other entries that define
mutually exclusive sets.  See Degree-of-Freedom Sets  for a list of these entries.
5.Element identification numbers should be unique with respect to all other element identification
numbers.
6.RROD, among other eligible rigid element types, can be selected via MPC and SET3.
7.Forces of multipoint constraint may be recovered in all solution sequences, except SOL 129, with the
MPCFORCE Case Control command.RROD Rigid Pin -Ended Element Connection

8.Rigid elements are ignored in heat transfer problems. If used in a multi-physics coupled problem
using SUBSTEP, they participate in the mechanical substep but are ignored in the heat transfer
subsstep through automatic deactivation. For more information on deactivation, see the DEACTEL
keyword under the NLMOPTS Bulk Data entry and the associated Remark 10. for that entry.
9.The degree-of-freedom selected to be dependent must have a nonzero component along the axis of
the element. This implies that the element must have finite length.
10. Fluid Grids (Identified by a -1 in the CD field of the GRID entry) do not support the use of Rigid
elements, use MPC entries. S ee Rigid Elements and Multipoint Constraints (R -type, MPC)  in the MSC Nastran
Reference Guide for a discussion of rigid elements.
11. For the Lagrange method, the thermal expansion effect will be computed, if user supplies the thermal
expansion coefficient, ALPHA, and the thermal load is requested by the
TEMPERATURE(INITIAL) and TEMPERATURE(LOAD) Case Control commands. The
temperature of the element is taken as the average temperature of the two connected grid points GA
and G B.&lt;/p&gt;

Relative Spin Rates Between Rotors2718
Main Index
Remarks:
1.The ROTORID-ROTRSEID pair must be unique across all RSPINR entries, but the ROTORID
and ROTRSEID fields individually need not be unique.
2.Depending upon the type of analysis being performed, a RSPINR/RSPINT entry should be present
for each rotor defined by a ROTORG or ROTORAX entry whose gyroscopic effects are to be
included in the analysis.   If missing for a rotor, then that rotor is assumed to be stationary and the
analysis proceeds accordingly. The absence of a RSPINR/RSPINT entry for a rotor is noted in the
.f06 file via an appropriate user information message.
3.RSPINR/RSPINT entries are honored and processed only in residual or assembly jobs and are
ignored in external superelement creation jobs. For rotor defined in external SE, the GRIDA and
GRIDB specified in RSPINR must be part of the SEs ASET during creation run. This requirement
is relaxed for rotors defined in PART SE.
4.The rotor spin axis is determined from the ROTORG or ROTORAX entries. The positive rotation
vector is from GRIDA to GRIDB. GRIDA and GRIDB must be specified on the ROTORG or
ROTORAX entry.
If ROTRSEID refers to a secondary external superelement, then GRIDA and GRIDB must be points
associated with the ROTORID  of the primary external superelement since the secondary external
superelement derives all of its properties from the primary external superelement.
5.If SPTID is a real number, the value is considered constant. For a reference rotor identified using a
RGYRO entry, the speed of the rotor is equal to that defined in RGYRO entry itself.
6.For a rotor which is not a reference rotor, the speed is calculated based on the ratio of SPDIT entry
of its RSPINR entry to SPDIT field of its reference rotor RSPINR entry, times reference rotor speed
from the RGYRO entry.

7.If SPTID is an integer number, the value references a DDVAL entry that specifies the relative rotor
spin rates. The number of spin rates for each rotor must be the same. Relative spin rates are
determined by correlation of table entries. The ith entry for each rotor specifies the relative spin rates
between rotors at RPMi/FREQi. Spin rates for the reference rotor must be in ascending or descending
order.
8.Rotor structural damping specified by the GR entry will be added as equivalent viscous damping or
structural damping depending on the solution. That is,
where  is a user parameter, or
depending on the solution sequence, SYNC/ASYNC and value of PARAM,GYROAVG. See Remark
10. for all the damping and circulation terms added to the equation in the different cases .
9.Rayleigh damping for the rotor will be calculated as
10. The various rotor damping and circulation matrices applicable to frequency response and complex
eigenvalue solutions are shown in the following table. For the fixed reference frame, the circulation
terms are generated from the rotating structure. For the rotating reference frame, the circulation terms
are generated from the stator. BrotorstructuralGR

Remarks:
1.The ROTORID-ROTRSEID pair must be unique across all RSPINT entries, but the ROTORID
and ROTRSEID fields individually need not be unique.
2.Depending upon the type of analysis being performed, a RSPINR/RSPINT entry should be present
for each rotor defined by a ROTORG or ROTORAX entry whose gyroscopic effects are to be
included in the analysis.   If missing for a rotor, then that rotor is assumed to be stationary and the
analysis proceeds accordingly. The absence of a RSPINR/RSPINT entry for a rotor is noted in the
.f06 file via an appropriate user information message.
3.RSPINR/RSPINT entries are honored and processed only in residual or assembly jobs and are
ignored in external superelement creation jobs. For rotor defined in external SE, the GRIDA and
GRIDB specified in RSPINT must be part of the SEs ASET during creation. This requirement is
relaxed for rotors defined in PART SE.
4.The rotor spin axis is determined from the ROTORG or ROTORAX entries. The positive rotation
vector is from GRIDA to GRIDB. GRIDA and GRIDB must be specified on the ROTORG or
ROTORAX entry.
If ROTRSEID refers to a secondary external superelement, then GRIDA and GRIDB must be points
associated with the ROTORID  of the primary external superelement since the secondary external
superelement derives all of its properties from the primary external superelement.
5.SPTID references a TABLED1 entry that specifies the rotor spin rate history.
6.Rotor structural damping specified by the GR entry will be added as equivalent viscous damping. The
equivalent damping will be calculated using:
where WR3 is a user parameter.
In case WR3R is specified in RSPINT, then WR3R is used for determining equivalent viscous
damping for this particular rotor instead of WR3.
7.Rayleigh damping for the rotor will be calculated asWR4R Specifies “average” excitation frequency , in radians per unit time,  for calculation of
rotor damping and circulation terms for rotor structural damping specified through
material entries. (Real, Default = 0.)
WRHR Specifies “average” excitation frequency , in radians per unit time,  for calculation of
rotor damping and circulation terms for rotor structural hybrid damping specified
through ROTHYBD card. (Real, Default = 0.)Describer Meaning

&lt;p&gt;2729 RSPLINE
Interpolation Constraint Element
Main Index
Defines multipoint constraints for the interpolation of displacements at grid points.
Note that RSPLINE is not supported in NLPERF SOL 400.
Format:
Example:
Remarks:
1.Displacements are interpolated from the equations of an elastic beam passing through the grid points.
This is a linear method only element, and not controlled with the Case Control command RIGID.
2.A blank field for Ci indicates that all six degrees-of-freedom at Gi are independent.  Since G1 must
be independent, no field is provided for C1.  Since the last grid point must also be independent, the
last field must be a Gi, not a Ci.  For the example shown G1, G3, and G6 are independent.  G2 has
six constrained degrees-of-freedom while G4 and G5 each have three.
3.Dependent (i.e., constrained) degrees-of-freedom assigned by one rigid element may not also be
assigned dependent by another rigid element or by a multipoint constraint.
4.Degrees-of-freedom declared to be independent by one rigid body element can be made dependent
by another rigid body element or by a multipoint constraint.
5.EIDs must be unique.
6.RSPLINE, among other eligible rigid element types, can be selected via MPC and SET3.
7.Forces of multipoint constraint may be recovered in all solution sequences, except SOL 129, with the
MPCFORCE Case Control command.RSPLINE Interpolation Constraint Element

8.Rigid  elements are ignored in heat transfer problems. If used in a multi-physics coupled problem
using SUBSTEP, they participate in the mechanical substep but are ignored in the heat transfer
subsstep through automatic deactivation. For more information on deactivation, see the DEACTEL
keyword under the NLMOPTS Bulk Data entry and the associated Remark 10. for that entry.
9.See Rigid Elements and Multipoint Constraints (R -type, MPC)  in the MSC Nastran Reference Guide for a
discussion of rigid elements.
10. The m -set coordinates specified on this entry may not be specified on other entries that define
mutually exclusive sets.  See Degree-of-Freedom Sets  for a list of these entries.
11. The constraint coefficient matrix is affected by the order of the Gi Ci pairs on the RSPLINE entry.&lt;br&gt;
The order of the pairs should be specified in the same order that they appear along the line that joins
the two regions.  If this order is not followed then the RSPLINE will have folds in it that may yield
some unexpected interpolation results.
12. The independent degrees-of-freedom that are the rotation components most nearly parallel to the line
joining the regions should not normally be constrained.
13. The RSPLINE has a limit of 100 grid points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2731 RSSCON
Shell-to-Solid Element Connector

Note that RSSCON is not supported in NLPERF SOL 400.
Format:
Examples:
Remarks:
1.RSSCON generates a multipoint constraint that models a clamped connection between a shell and a
solid element. The shell degrees-of-freedom are put in the dependent set (m -set).  The translational
degrees-of-freedom of the shell edge are connected to the translational degrees-of-freedom of the
upper and lower solid edge.  The two rotational degrees-of-freedom of the shell are connected to the
translational degrees-of-freedom of the lower and upper edges of the solid element face. Poisson’s
ratio effects are considered in the translational degrees-of-freedom.RSSCON Shell -to-Solid Element Connector

2.The shell grid point must lie on the line connecting the two solid grid points. It can have an offset
from this line, which can not be more than 5% of the distance between the two solid grid points. The
shell grid points that are out of the tolerance will not be constrained, and a fatal message will be issued.&lt;br&gt;
This tolerance is adjustable.  Please see PARAM,TOLRSC and PARAM,SEPIXOVR.
3.When using the TYPE = “ELEM” option
•The solid e lements are CHEXA, CPENTA, and CTETRA with and without midside nodes. The
shell elements are CQUAD4, CTRIA3, CQUADR, CTRIAR, CQUAD8, or CTRIA6. If the
solid element has mid-side nodes, then the shell element needs mid-side nodes on the common
edge.
•Both the shell and solid elements have to belong to the same superelement. This restriction can
be bypassed using SEELT entry to reassign the downstream boundary element to an upstream
superelement.&lt;br&gt;
•It is not recommended to connect more than one shell element to the same solid using the ELEM
option.  If attempted, conflicts in the multipoint constraint relations may lead to UFM 6692.
4.When using  TYPE = “GRID” option
•The GRID option does not verify that the grids used are valid shell and/or solid grids .
•The grids in the GRID option can be in different superelements.  The shell grid must be in the
upstream superelement.
5.It is recommended that the height of the solid element’s face is approximately equal to the shell
element’s thickness of the shell.  The shell edge should then be placed in the middle of the solid face.
6.The shell edge may coincide with the upper or lower edge of the solid face.
7.RSSCON, among other eligible rigid element types, can be selected via MPC and SET3.
8.Forces of multipoint constraints may be recovered with the MPCFORCE Case Control command.
9.The RSSCON is ignored in heat -transfer problems. If used in a multi-physics coupled problem using
SUBSTEP, they participate in the mechanical substep but are ignored in the heat transfer subsstep
through automatic deactivation. For more information on deactivation, see the DEACTEL keyword

Remarks:
1.Two methods are available to process rigid elements: equation elimination or Lagrange multipliers.
The Case Control command, RIGID, selects the method.
2.For the Lagrange method, Nastran will create internally the Lagrange multiplier degrees-of-freedom
in addition to the 18 displacement degrees-of-freedom given by grid points GA, GB, and GC. The
number of Lagrange multiplier degrees-of-freedom is equal to the number of dependent degrees-of-
freedom.
3.For the linear method, the total number of components in CNA, CNB, and CNC must equal six; for
example, CNA = 1236, CNB = 3, CNC = 3. Furthermore, they must jointly be capable of
representing any general rigid body motion of the element. For the Lagrange method, the total
number of components must also be six. However, only CNA= 123456 (Default) or CNB = 123456
or CNC = 123456 is allowed. For this type of element, RTRPLT1 gives a simpler input format.RTRPLT Rigid Triangular Plate

4.For the linear method, the dependent degrees-of-freedom will be made members of the m-set. For the
Lagrange method, they may or may not be members of the m-set, depending on the method selected
on the RIGID Case Control command. However, the rules regarding the m-set described below apply
to both types of methods.
5.Dependent degrees-of-freedom assigned by one rigid element may not also be assigned dependent by
another rigid element or by a multipoint constraint.
6.Element identification numbers should be unique with respect to all other element identification

12. For the Lagrange method, the thermal expansion effect will be computed, if user supplies the thermal
expansion coefficient, ALPHA, and the thermal load is requested by the
TEMPERATURE(INITIAL) and TEMPERATURE(LOAD) Case Control commands. The
temperature of the element is defined as the following. the bar GA-GB will have the average

boundary points are placed in the b -set.
2.Degrees-of-freedom listed on SEBSETi entries must be exterior degrees-of-freedom of the
superelement and may not be specified on SECSETi entries.
3.Degrees-of-freedom specified on this entry form members of the mutually exclusive b -set.  They may
not be specified on other entries that define mutually exclusive sets.  See Degree-of-Freedom Sets  for a
list of these entries.
4.If PARAM,AUTOSPC is YES, then singular b -set and c -set degrees-of-freedom will be reassigned as
follows:
•If there are no o -set (omitted) degrees-of-freedom, then singular b -set and c -set degrees-of-

Remarks:
1.This specification must be specified in the MAIN Bulk Data and is meaningful only if part
superelements (using BEGIN SUPER) or external superelements created by employing the
EXTSEOUT Case Control command exist in the data.
2.TYPE = PRIMARY indicates that the superelement is a part superelement (using BEGIN SUPER).
3.TYPE = “COLLCTR” indicates a collector superelement which does not contain any grids or scalar
points.
4.TYPE = “EXTERNAL”, “EXTOP2”, “EXTOP4” or “EXTPCH ” indicates an external superelement
created by employing the EXTSEOUT Case Control command in an earlier job. See discussion
under the description of the EXTSEOUT Case Control command. (For employing external
superelements using the old three-step procedure, see discussion under the description of parameter
EXTDROUT in Chapter 5.)
5.A superelement whose TYPE is “PRIMARY, “EXTERNAL”,  “EXTOP2” or “EXTPCH ” may itself
be re-positioned by the use of an SELOC or an SEMPLN entry or both.
If it references an SELOC entry, then the primary superelement will be positioned at the location
implied by the SELOC entry.
If it references an SEMPLN entry, then a mirror image of the primary superelement will be positioned
using the plane defined by the SEMPLN entry.
If it references both an SELOC entry and an SEMPLN entry, then a mirror image of the primary
superelement will first be created using the plane defined by the SEMPLN entry and then it will be
positioned at the location implied by the SELOC entry.
6.TYPE = “REPEAT” and TYPE = “MIRROR” have many common features, but they also have some
important differences. These are described below.
The following comments apply to both TYPE= “REPEAT” and TYPE = “MIRROR”:
a.An SEID whose TYPE is “REPEAT” or “MIRROR” is referred to as a secondary superelement.
The RSEID specified in this case is regarded as the primary superelement.
b.The primary superelement must be either a part superelement or an external superelement created
by employing the EXTSEOUT Case Control command in an earlier job. It must be defined via
its own SEBULK entry wherein TYPE must be either “PRIMARY, “EXTERNAL”, “ EXTOP2”&lt;br&gt;
or “EXTPCH” .LOC Coincident location check option for manual connection option. (Character:  “YES” or
“NO”; Default = “YES”). See Remark 10.
YES Connect the boundary grid points only if they are separated by no more
than TOL, or a UFM will be used. (Default).
NO Connect the boundary grid points regardless of separation distance.
UNITNO FORTRAN unit number for the OUTPUT2 or OUTPUT4 file (applicable and
meaningful only when TYPE =“EXTOP2” or “EXTOP4”). See Remarks 4. and 5.Describer Meaning&lt;/p&gt;

Partition Superelement Connection2746
Main Index
c.The primary superelement does not include superelements upstream of the primary superelement.
d.The primary superelement may be re-positioned as indicated in Remark 5.
e.If the primary superelement specified by RSEID is a part superelement, then the secondary
superelement is a &amp;ldquo;G-set&amp;rdquo; copy of the primary superelement.  In this case, the boundary, loads,
constraints and reduction procedure of the secondary superelement can be different from those of
its primary superelement.
f.If the primary superelement specified by RSEID is an external superelement resulting from the
use of the EXTSEOUT Case Control command in an earlier job, then the secondary
superelement is an &amp;ldquo;A-set&amp;rdquo; copy of the primary superelement.  In this case, the boundary, loads,
constraints and reduction procedure of the secondary superelement are set and are the same as
those of its primary superelement.
The following comments apply only to TYPE= &amp;ldquo;REPEAT&amp;rdquo;:
g.The secondary superelement in this case may reference an SELOC entry, an SEMPLN entry or
both or none.
If it references an SELOC entry, then an identical copy of its primary superelement will be
positioned at the location implied by the SELOC entry.
If it references an SEMPLN entry, then a mirror image copy of the primary superelement will be
positioned using the plane defined by the SEMPLN entry.
If it references both an SELOC entry and an SEMPLN entry, then a mirror image copy of the
primary superelement will first be created using the plane defined by the SEMPLN entry and then
it will be positioned at the location implied by the SELOC entry.
If it references neither an SELOC entry nor an SEMPLN entry, then the secondary superelement
will merely be a duplicate of the primary superelement positioned at the same location as the
primary superelement.  This usage is extremely uncommon.  Hence the program cautions the user
about this usage by issuing a user warning message.
The following comments apply only to TYPE= &amp;ldquo;MIRROR&amp;rdquo;:
h.The secondary superelement in this case must reference an SEMPLN entry.  (Otherwise, the
program will terminate the execution with an appropriate user fatal message.)  In addition, the
secondary superelement may also reference an SELOC entry.
If the secondary superelement references only an SEMPLN entry, then a mirror image copy of the
primary superelement will be positioned using the plane defined by the SEMPLN entry.
If it references both an SELOC entry and an SEMPLN entry, then a mirror image copy of the
primary superelement will first be created using the plane defined by the SEMPLN entry and then
it will be positioned at the location implied by the SELOC entry.
7.METHOD  = “MANUAL” requires SECONCT entries.  SEBNDRY and SEEXCLD, which
reference SEID, will produce a fatal message.
8.SECONCT, SEBNDRY, and SEEXCLD entries can be used to augment the search procedure
and/or override the global tolerance.
9.For combined automatic and manual boundary search, the METHOD =“AUTO” should be
specified and connections should be specified on a SECONCT entry.&lt;/p&gt;

10. TOL&amp;rsquo;s default of zero means that the default value will be taken from the user PARAMeter
CONFAC. CONFAC&amp;rsquo;s default is 1.0E-5. Furthermore, TOL on SEBULK is the default value for
TOL on all SECONCT entries referencing SEID. In other words, TOL and LOC are the default
values that can be modified between two superelements by providing the required tolerance on the
SECONCT entry.
11. A SEID=0 is valid for the residual part only if it is desired to set a TOL value for the residual.
12. TYPE = “EXTROM” indicates a smart superelement with FMU attached to FORTRAN unit
number specified in field=UNITNO.&lt;/p&gt;

and ‘unload’ the structure to determine the unstressed shape SUBCASE.
a.‘Linear’ perturbation analysis: The ANALYSIS Case Control command may be used to define a
‘linear’ perturbation analysis SUBCASE, separate from the subcases used to load the model.
Normal modes and frequency response subcases with ANALYSIS=MODES  or
ANALYSIS=DFREQ  will use the final displacement results and loads from the previous nonlinear
subcase to generate the stiffness, differential stiffness, and follower force matrices for use in the
‘linear’ response analyses. Data recovery will be based on the requests above and within the

In the previous example, subcases 2 and 3 will use the results from subcase 1, subcase 4 will
continue the loading application, and subcase 5 will use the results from subcase 4. For the ‘linear’
analyses, the mass matrix will be based on the undeformed geometry and the damping matrix will
be generated using the deformed geometry. This will allow analyses of ‘large’ displacement results
(PARAM, LGDISP, 1), in addition to material nonlinear analyses.
b.User input of the ‘stressed’ or deformed geometry: ANALYSIS=HOT2COLD  allows the user to
input the ‘stressed’ or deformed geometry (normal bulk data input) and ‘unload’ the structure to
determine the unstressed shape. This uses an iterative technique with each iteration a nonlinear
analysis. This feature will also ‘reset’ the geometry to the ‘unstressed’ position for additional
subcases. Related PARAMETERS are HTOCTOL, HTOCITS, and HTOCPRT.

Constrains Stiffness Singularities via m-sets or s-sets
Main Index
Remarks:
1.AUTOSPC specifies the action to take when singularities exist in the stiffness matrix.
AUTOSPC=YES means that singularities will be constrained automatically. AUTOSPC=NO means
that singularities will not be constrained. If AUTOSPC=NO, then the user should take extra caution
analyzing the results of the grid point singularity table and the computed epsilons. See Constraint and
Mechanism Problem Identification in SubDMAP SEKR in the MSC Nastran Reference Guide  for details of
singularity and mechanism identification and constraint.
2.Singularity ratios smaller than EPSSING are listed as potentially singular. If AUTOSPC=YES, then
the identified singularities with a ratio smaller than EPS will be automatically constrained. If
EPSSING has the same value as EPS, then all singularities are listed. If EPSSING is larger than EPS,
the printout of singularity ratios equal to exactly zero is suppressed. EPSSING must be greater than
or equal to EPS. If not, the program will set EPSSING equal to EPS.
3.If the PUNCH keyword is specified, then automatically generated SPCs or MPCs are placed in SPCi
or MPCi Bulk Data entry format on the PUNCH file.
4.By default, in all solution sequences except 106, 129 and 400, the auto-SPC operation is performed
for both superelements and the residual structure. (Auto-SPC processing is disabled in heat transfer
analysis). In SOLs 106, 129 and 400, the default is to perform the operation only on superelements.&lt;br&gt;
If it is desired to perform auto-SPC on the residual structure in:
a.SOLs 106, then specify PARAM,AUTOSPCR,YES and is only applied to the omitted degrees-
of-freedom. The AUTOSPC command is ignored for the residual structure.
b.SOLs 129, then specify PARAM,AUTOSPCR,YES. The AUTOSPC command is ignored for
the residual structure.
c.For SOL 400, see Remarks 6. and 7.
5.The MPC option may be somewhat more expensive than the SPC option. However, it provides more
realistic structural modeling than the SPC. When the MPC option is selected, the multipoint
constraint may be applied on some degree of freedom for which the stiffness matrix is identified as
singular. If the MPC is inapplicable to some degree of freedom, the SPC is used instead.SPC Applies single-point constraints on degrees of freedom identified as singular.
(Default)
MPC Applies multipoint constraints on degrees of freedom identified as singular.
ZERO Requests the printout of singularities with zero stiffness ratios in the singularity
summary table (Default).
NOZERO Disables the printout of those singularities with zero stiffness ratios in the
singularity summary table.Describer Meaning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide
Constrains Stiffness Singularities via m-sets or s-sets234
Main Index
6.For SOL 400, if RESIDUAL option is requested, the AUTOSPC operation is applied to both the
residual structure and the superelements. Without RESIDUAL option, the AUTOSPC operation is
applied to the superelements only. For default (no AUTOSPCE command), AUTOSPC operation
is not applied to the residual structure, but it is applied to the superelements. Both parameters
PARAM,AUTOSPC and PARAM,AUTOSPCR have no effect in SOL 400. Please note that the
AUTOSPC (RESIDUAL) command should not be used in the geometrical nonlinear analysis,
because it may over constrain the structural model.
7.For SOL 400, the AUTOSPC (RESIDUAL) command can be placed above the subcase level,
between subcase and step, and below the step level. The AUTOSPC operation is performed each step
of a subcase if it is required. In the following example, step 10 uses SPC option, step 20 uses MPC
option, and no AUTOSPC operation is performed for step 30.
SUBCASE 1
STEP 10
AUTOSPC(RESIDUAL,SPC) = YES
LOAD = 10
STEP 20
AUTOSPC(RESIDUAL,MPC) = YES
LOAD = 20
STEP 30
LOAD = 30
For superelements, only one AUTOSPC command can be specified. If there are multiple AUTOSPC
commands in the Case Control packet, the one for the first step of the first subcase will be used. In
the previous example, the AUTOSPC under step 10 is used.
8.For SOL 400, AUTOSPC equals YES for linear perturbation if DOMAINSOLVER ACMS is
defined in the executive system.
9.For SOL 101 with contact, user can turn on AUTOSPC by using RESIDUAL option. i.e., when
AUTOSPC(RESIDUAL)=YES, AUTOSPC will be turned on for analysis with contact .&lt;/p&gt;

Remarks:
1.It is highly recommended that the user should run MSC Nastran for Step-1 with maximum smp
setting. Calculation of higher order mass invariants are very computation intensive; to make their
calculation faster MSC Nastran leverages efficient shared memory parallelization (SMP).
2.To minimize the data storage and enable efficient data recovery in MSC Nastran, the use of MSC
Nastran-AVL EXCITETM Interface requires the use of EXTSEOUT feature. The use of this feature
would be in its standard MSC Nastran capacity in SOL 103 or 400, e.g.:
ASSIGN OUTPUT2=&amp;lsquo;crankextse.op2&amp;rsquo;,UNIT=80,DELETE
&amp;hellip;
EXTSEOUT(ASMBULK,EXTBULK,EXTID=20 ,DMIGOP2=80 )
&amp;hellip;
During step-1 (EXB file export), to limit the size of external superelement (SE) .op2 the user should
only request outputs for sets of physical quantities that are of interest. For, e.g., displacement and
stress on surface nodes: NOD6 If model is pure bar/beam elements with concentrated masses, this option can
output the element dictionary table as well as element stiffness matrix (Default =
No):
1.YES: Output KDICT &amp;amp; KELM
2.NO: Do not output KDICT &amp;amp; KELM
If NOD6 = YES these parameters are automatically set MASINVAR = NONE,
RECOVRYM = NO, MFFEXP = NO, EXBOSET = YES
AVLPOST Requests data recovery using the INP4 file generated by AVL EXCITETM (Default
= No):
1.YES: Request data recovery
2.NO: data recovery
AVLPOST = YES requires EXBBODY = NO as the MSC Nastran AVL
EXCITETM interface cannot generate the EXB file and conduct data recovery in
the same run.
POSTUNT Unit number of the assigned INP4 file generated by AVL EXCITETM which will
be used for data recovery.
EXBONLY Requests standard DMAP solution and data recovery following
MSC Nastran-AVL EXCITETM interface (Default = NO):
1.NO: Proceed with standard DMAP solution and data recovery after
generating EXB file.
2.YES: Executes only MSC Nastran-AVL EXCITETM interface.Describer Meaning&lt;/p&gt;

DISP(PLOT) = 101
&amp;hellip;
STRESS(PLOT) = 102
above, the displacement and velocity can only be recovered on set 101 and stresses on set 102 during
step-2 (data recovery).
DISP=ALL, STRESS=ALL, STRAIN=ALL, etc., should be used carefully for large models during
step-1 as it could lead to significant performance degradation and large external SE .op2 file size.
3.AVL EXCITETM supports the following flexbody types which will be set automatically based on the
user inputs of AVLEXB case controls:
a.CON6: Is General large motion flexbody which is selected when the user enters “NOD6=NO”
and “MASINVAR=FULL/FIRST”.
b.SMOT: Is Small motion flexbody which is selected when the user enters “NOD6=NO” and
“MASINVAR=NONE”.
c.NOD6: Is a special flexbody model consisting of pure bar/beam (1-D) elements with
concentrated masses. It is selected when the user enters “NOD6=YES”. Here the dictionary table
for bar/beam elements for each bear/beam element shall be outputted into the EXB file. NOD6
automatically means that the following are not calculated and output into the EXB file: (1) Mass
invarients, (2) Recovery Matrix, (3) A-set Orthonormalization and associated
Eigenvalue/Eigenvector and (4) Component modes.
4.MSC Nastran does not export KELM to EXB file for NOD6 body. AVL EXCITETM v2019 provides
a utility to calculate and write KELM to existing EXB file.
5.Degree of freedom (dof) table (DOFTtable) is written to EXB file for the following dof sets:
a.A-set : Dof table for a-set are always written out to the EXB file.
b.O+M-set : Dof table for o+m-set are only written out to the EXB file if the recovery matrix is
requested by the user. In case the user selects partial recovery by specifying the EXBOSET only a
subset of o+m-set would be output in the dof Table.
6.GEOM table contains the coordinates of nodes in MSC Nastran basic coordinate system. Two table
of coordinates are always written to the EXB file: (1) A-set and (2) F+M-set.
7.OUTGSTRS or OUTGSTRN entries require the use of the standard MSC Nastran STRESS= or
STRAIN= Case Control commands used in conjunction with GPSTRESS= or GPSTRAIN= Case
Control commands to produce modal grid point stress or strain. They also require the use of
PARAM,POST,-1 or PARAM,POST,1. GSTRESS(PLOT)= or GPSTRAIN(PLOT)= will suppress
grid stress or strain output to the MSC Nastran .f06 file. The modal grid point stress or strain are not
output to the EXB file but to standard MSC Nastran .op2 file.
8.The default value of “MASINVAR = FULL” calculates all the mass invariants. In case of large models
the calculations of higher order mass invariants can be time consuming; hence, it is recommended
that the user first run with either “MASINVAR = FIRST” or “MASINVAR =NONE” to validate the
model.
9.MFFEXP = YES requests output of Mass matrix of F+M set and requires the user to request full
recovery (RECOVRYM=YES and EXBOSET = ALL).&lt;/p&gt;

10. Typically SOL 400 is used to produce a preloaded AVL EXCITETM EXB file.
a.Standard SOL 400 nonlinear analysis prohibits the existence of an o-set; hence the EXTSEOUT
case control must be used (see above Remark 2.).
b.In the preload run the structure should be statically supported and follower loading must be
applied as a self equilibrating load set (not with SPC relationships!). In the ANALYSIS=MODES
step, usually, the structure should be a free-free structure to preserve its six rigid body modes. In
order to produce modal amplitudes and mode shapes and to ensure residual vector calculations,
SPOINTs and Q-sets are required.
The example below is a typical SOL400 problem setup:
ASSIGN OUTPUT2=&amp;lsquo;seplt3rbe.out2&amp;rsquo;,UNIT=80,DELETE

METHOD = 210
$ Turn residual vectors on
RESVEC = COMPONENT
STRESS(PLOT) = ALL
STRAIN(PLOT) = ALL
GPSTRESS(PLOT) = ALL
GPSTRAIN(PLOT) = ALL
c.In the above example, the SPC set in the ANALYSIS=NLSTAT must be a static (nonredundant)
constraint condition. Note that in the ANALYSIS=MODES STEP, the SPC constraint set has
been removed. The definition of the attachment a-set for identifying attachment points and for
q-set for specifying the desired number of modal amplitudes for orthonormalization should be
done in the main bulk data section, e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;

d.If CONTACT is required as part of the preloading, it is highly recommended that the friction
option be turned on by using an appropriate BCPARA bulk data entry setting, e.g.,
$ Select bilinear Coulomb friction for all subcases
BCPARA, 0, FTYPE, 6
If contact friction is not turned on, the tangential motion between the two parts coming into
contact will most likely not be constrained and incorrect or fatal results will occur.
11. The AVL EXCITETM solver expects singularities, other than the rigid body modes, of the model to
be constrained; hence, it is recommended that the user constrain singularities automatically using the
PARAM,AUTOSPC in SOL 103 and AUTOSPC (RESIDUAL) command in SOL 400.
12. After conducting the AVL EXCITETM simulation the data recovery is conducted in SOL 111, SOL
112 and SOL 400 using the EXTSEOUT feature. Using External SE to conduct data recovery would
make the data recovery faster and minimize the database size by storing only the information required
for recovery. The user interface for data recovery is straightforward requiring the attachment of the
SE databases, stored on the .op2 file, generated in the SE generation step during EXB file export
together with the ASM and PCH files.
13. During the data recovery it should be noted that PARAM,POST setting for the External SE are not
picked up from the main bulk. If physical quantities inside External SE (stresses,etc) are to be output
to op2 the user can add PARAM,POST in the case control if they want it applied globally or add
PARAM,POST manually to the External SE pch file.
14. Virtual mass is supported in MSC Nastran-AVL EXCITETM Interface by setting  MASINVAR=NONE&lt;br&gt;
and through t he use of standard VMOPT parameter entry.
15. For STRUCTURE and FLUID coupled system, METHOD(COUPLED) can be used for EXB
generation. However, all nodes on fluid face needs to be coupled with structure for AVLEXB
otherwise, mass and inertia of moment will be incorrect in EXB.&lt;/p&gt;

Example:
Alternate Format and Example:
Remarks:
1.Elements connected entirely to the exterior points of an upstream superelement are called boundary
elements and are assigned to the downstream superelement.  The SEELT entry provides the means
of reassigning the element to the upstream superelement.  This entry may be applied to boundary
elements only.
2.Open sets are allowed with the “THRU” option.
3.Elements processed with primary superelements will also be contained in any referencing secondary
superelement.
4.EIDi may refer to plot elements, general elements, and structural elements.
5.This entry does not change the exterior grid point set of the superelement.
6.SEELT can only be specified in the main Bulk Data Section and is ignored after the BEGIN
SUPER =n command.
7.If the model contains a BEGIN SUPER, the SEELT entry will assign the specified elements to the
SEID (not just the boundary elements). This is an alternative to using SESET. In this case, SEID =0
is a valid entry. For further information, refer to the MSC Nastran Reference Guide .SEELT Superelement Boundary Element Reassignment

Defines the generalized degrees-of-freedom of the superelement to be used in generalized dynamic reduction
or component mode synthesis.
Format:
Example:
Remarks:
1.Degrees-of-freedom specified on this entry may not be specified for another superelement.
2.Generalized degrees-of-freedom are interior to the residual structure.
3.Connectivity to the superelement is provided by this entry.  There is no need to use a CSUPEXT
entry for this  purpose.
4.Degrees-of-freedom specified on this  entry form members of the mutually exclusive q -set.  They may
not be specified on other entries that define mutually exclusive sets.  See Degree-of-Freedom Sets  for a
list of these entries.
5.This entry describes the set used for generalized degrees-of-freedom only for the SEID  listed.&lt;br&gt;
Degrees-of-freedom listed on this entry must also be members of a downstream superelement.  The
set used for these variables in downstream superelements must be prescribed by user action using
other entries.  If they are scalar points, they are automatically in the residual structure, which is the
recommended procedure.  If they are grid points, it is the user’s responsibility to place them in a
downstream superelement.
Generalized degrees-of-freedom of superelements that are also members of the residual structure are
included as dynamic variables by placing them in the a -set.  It is also necessary to place some or all
residual structure physical degrees-of-freedom in the a -set to allow the boundary points to participate
in the system mode shapes.SEQSET Superelement Generalized Degree-of-Freedom

Remarks:
1.Interior grid points may also be defined via field 9 of the GRID and GRIDG Bulk Data entries.  The
SESET entry takes precedence over the SEID field on the GRID on GRIDG entries. SESET defines
grid and scalar points to be included as interior to a superelement. SESET may be used as the primary
means of defining superelements or it may be used in combination with SEELT entries which define
elements interior to a superelement.
2.Gi may appear on an SESET entry only once.
3.Scalar points are ignored unless a BEGIN SUPER is in the file.
4.Open sets are allowed with the “THRU” option.  Missing grid points (whether in “THRU” range or
mentioned explicitly) are not identified.
5.All degrees-of-freedom for Gi are placed in the o -set of the superelement. See Degree-of-Freedom Sets .

Superelement Tree Definition (Alternate Form of DTI,SETREE)2786
Main Index
6.If a superelement is not referenced on the DTI,SETREE or SETREE entry, then the manner in which
it is handled depends on the type of that superelement. If it is a PART superelement, then the residual
will be regarded as its downstream superelement and the undefined superelement will therefore be
placed immediately above the residual in the tree. If it is a Main Bulk Data superelement, then it will
also be handled like an undefined PART superelement as above if all of its exterior points belong to the
residual . However, if one or more of its exterior points do not belong to the residual, then the program
will terminate with a user fatal error complaining that one of more of the superelements are not in the
same path.
7.The SETREE entry will only work if PART (BEGIN SUPER) superelements exist in the model. If
there are no PARTs in the model, the SETREE entries will be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

Enforced Motion Value2806
Main Index
Defines an enforced displacement value for static analysis and an enforced motion value (displacement,
velocity or acceleration) in dynamic analysis.
Format:
Example:
Remarks:
1.In the static solution sequences, the set ID of the SPCD entry (SID) is selected by the LOAD Case
Control command.
2.In dynamic analysis, the selection of SID is determined by the presence of the LOADSET request in
Case Control as follows:
•There is no LOADSET request in Case Control
SID is selected by the EXCITEID field of an RLOAD1, RLOAD2, TLOAD1 or TLOAD2 Bulk
Data entry that has enforced motion specified in its TYPE field
•There is a LOADSET request in Case Control
SID is selected by LID in the selected LSEQ entries that correspond to the EXCITEID entry of
an RLOAD1, RLOAD2, TLOAD1 or TLOAD2 Bulk Data entry that has enforced motion
specified in its TYPE field.
3.Enforced Motion is not supported  with ANALYSIS=MTRAN in SOL200 and SOL400.

Enforced Motion Value
Main Index
5.Enforced motion may be specified on both SPCD and SPC Bulk Data entries. The SPCD entry is
selected according to Remark 2. and the SPC entry is selected by the SPC Case Control command.
The Di values from both of the selected SPCD and SPC entries will be combined to form a static (or
spatial) loading condition. But if a degree-of-freedom is duplicated on both SPCD and SPC then the
value of Di on the selected SPCD entry will override the value of Dion the selected SPC entry. In
addition, any degrees-of-freedom from the selected SPC entries and not duplicated will still be
included in the loading condition. This is illustrated in the examples below.
•Static analysis: In the example below in SUBCASE 11, D=1.0 at GRID 101 overrides D=1.2 on
the SPC entry. But GRID 201 is not specified on the selected SPCD and therefore D=1.2 from
the SPC entry is also enforced. Similary, in subcase 12, D=1.0 is enforced at GRID 201 and
D=1.2 at GRID 101.

created in the static analysis example above.

6.The LOAD Bulk Data entry will not combine an SPCD load entry .
7.In static analysis, this method of applying  enforced displacements is more efficient than the SPC entry
when more than one enforced displacement condition is applied.  It provides equivalent answers.&lt;/p&gt;

Enforced Motion Value2808
Main Index
8.In dynamic analysis, this direct method of specifying enforced motion is more accurate, efficient and
elegant than the large mass and Lagrange multiplier techniques.
9.For SOL 400, the SPCD entry requests enforced total displacement for a STEP while the SPCR entry
requests enforced relative displacements. SPCD is the position at the end of the applied STEP for
ANALYSIS=NLSTAT.
10. For SOL 400 using heat shell element with linear or quadratic nodal distribution, see option TEMPP
for NLMOPTS entry 1=TOP, 2=BOT or 3=MID).
11. In thermal analysis, this entry is used with SPC1 to specify a temperature boundary condition applied
on the selected grid or scalar point. To define time-varying boundary conditions, the user should
specify SPC1 and SPCD Bulk Data entries for SOL 400 while using TEMPBC Bulk Data entries
with TYPE=“TRAN” for SOL 159 .
12. If it is desired to enforce motion on the boundary point (a-set) of a superelement then define a high
stiffness element attached to the boundary point and apply the SPCD to the opposite point of the
high stiffness element. High  stiffness elements may be easily defined with CBUSH or CBAR.
13. SOL129 transient analysis does not support Di option for enforced motion. Use SOL400.
14. In SOL108, SOL111, SOL200/SOL400 ANALYSIS=MFREQ or DFREQ when frequency
dependency is present, the SPCFORCES are currently computed using the base materials. Thus their
values will be incorrect.Enforced Relative Displacement

In SOL 400, when a GRID has an applied load associated with it in the previous STEP and

may apply instead an SPC1 to the GRID to lock in the position of the grid from the previous

Example:
Remarks:
1.SPCR requests relative motion for a load step with respect to the previous step in SOL 400 . SPCR is
the companion entry to SPCD. SPCD requests total motion while SPCR requests relative motion.
SPCR is the position at activation of the boundary condition.SPCR Enforced Relative Motion Value

Gi Grid or scalar point identification number.  (Integer &amp;gt; 0)
Ci Component number.  (0 &amp;lt; Integer &amp;lt;  6; up to six unique Integers may be placed in the

Enforced Relative Displacement
SPCR associated with SPC1 or GRID/PS
Enforced Total Displacement

SPCD associated with SPC1 or GRID/PS
SPC No association required
In SOL 400, when a GRID has an applied load associated with it in the previous STEP and
the user wishes to pick up the resulting displacement as an enforced displacement in the
current STEP , then the recommended procedure is to use the SPCR. Alternatively, the user
may apply instead an SPC1 to the GRID to lock in the position of the grid from the previous
STEP .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SPCR
Enforced Relative Motion Value2812
Main Index
2.The enforced motion for a step, for SOL 400 , can be either total value or relative value. For SOL 400,
SPC and SPCD request total enforced motion. SPC1 and SPCR request the relative value. For
example, if a DOF is specified on a SPCR with 0.0 for step 2, the relative displacement of this DOF
for step 2 with respective to step 1 is 0.0. The total displacement of step 2 is 0.2 if the solution of step
1 for this DOF is 0.2.
3.The SCPD and SPCR entries can have the same SID, but they cannot be specified on the same DOF.
A user fatal error will be issued if SPCD and SPCR are specified on the same DOF.
4.In the static solution sequences, the SID of the SPCR entry (SID), same as SPCD, is selected by the
LOAD Case Control command.
5.For SOL 400, a global coordinate (Gi and CI) referenced on this entry must also be referenced on a
SPC1 Bulk Data entry and selected by the SPC Case Control command. Please note that, for this
purpose, SPC cannot be used together with SPCR. If SPC is used, a user fatal error will be issued.
6.For SOL 400, the LOAD Bulk Data entry will not combine an SPCR load entry .&lt;/p&gt;

3.The attachment flexibility (units of area) is used for smoothing the interpolation.  If DZ = 0.0, the
spline will pass through all deflected grid points.  If DZ is much greater than the spline area, a least
squares plane fit will be applied.  Intermediate values will provide smoothing.
4.When using the Mach Box method, BOX1 and BOX2 refer to the ID number of the first and last
aerodynamic grids (x,y pairs on the AEFACT entry) which will be used for interpolation to structural
grids.  BOX1 and BOX2 do not refer to Mach Boxes.
5.The USAGE field allows you to specify that the particular spline interpolant defined in this entry is
to be used for just the force transformation (FORCE) or just the displacement transformation (DISP)
or for both (BOTH).
(FORCE/BOTH splines are in the transform)
(DISP/BOTH splines are in the transform)
In general, the two transforms are done with distinct matrices.  Only when ALL splines are of type
BOTH is the familiar transpose relationship  satisfied. The default behavior
(BOTH for all splines) is compatible with versions of MSC  Nastran prior to Version 70.5.
In general, the USAGE field can be used to apply aerodynamic forces to the structure from
aerodynamic panels that are intended NOT to move (USAGE=FORCE) or to apply structural
displacements to aerodynamic grids whose forces are not to be applied to the structure
(USAGE=DISP). The DISP option is somewhat esoteric in that you are then suggesting that the
aeroelastic effect of the surface is important while its forces are not.  (In other words, only the forces
arising from its effects on other surfaces is important.) While there may be circumstances where this
is true, it is unlikely.  Take care that you included all the FORCEs from aerodynamic panels that are
important by including them in either FORCE or BOTH spline(s). MSC Nastran will NOT issue a
warning unless ALL forces are omitted.  All displacements may be omitted without warning (and is a
means to perform “rigid aerodynamic” analyses).

3.The flexibilities DZ, DTHX, and DTHY are used for smoothing.  (Zero attachment flexibility values
will imply rigid attachment (i.e., no smoothing, whereas negative values of DTHX or DTHY will

discussion of special cases.

6.When using the Mach Box method, ID1 and ID2 refer to the ID number of the first and last

7.DTOR is the ratio of rotational to linear deflection and, in lieu of a more accurate estimate, a value
of 1.0 is recommended.  A different value may be used; e.g., if DTOR is much greater than 1.0,
primarily rotational deflection will occur; if DTOR is much less than 1.0, primarily linear deflection
will occur.

Remarks:
1.The flexibilities DZ and DZR are used for smoothing. (Zero attachment flexibility values will imply
rigid attachment (i.e., no smoothing). The DZ and DZR values are used to derive stiffness of the
translational and rotational (respectively) bushing stiffnesses. Bushing elements are placed between
the interpolating surface and the connections to the dependent and independent grids.
2.If an aerodynamic mesh is entered using AEGRID/AETRIA3/AEQUAD4 entries, the CAERO ID
is not required and the AELIST refers to the element ID’s of the aero mesh. In this scenario, if
VSTYPE=AERO, VSLIST must point to an AELIST that defines the virtual surface mesh by
identifying the aerodynamic elements that make up the surface. For the Mach Box method, the
AELIST refers to the aerodynamic grids (x,y pairs on the AEFACT entry). For all other aero methods,
the AELIST items are box id’s.
3.The USAGE field allows you to specify that the particular spline interpolant defined in this entry is
to be used for just the force transformation (FORCE) or just the displacement transformation (DISP)
or for both (BOTH). See Remark 5. of the SPLINE1 Bulk Data entry.
4.CAERO2 entries are not supported. The CAERO entry may be blank unless points from a CAERO4
or a CAERO5 are specified. The list of splined points may span multiple aerodynamic components.
If the spline defines points from multiple CAERO4 or CAERO5 entries, then any one of the
referenced CAERO IDs is valid input.
5.The METHOD option provides a choice in using all 6 degrees of freedom (FPS6) on the
independent points or only the translational degrees of freedom (FPS3) in connecting between the
virtual surface and the independent points. Similarly, there is a choice in connecting the virtual
surface to the dependent points (METHVS).METHVS Similar to METHOD, this field chooses whether or not to include the rotational
degrees-of-freedom of virtual surface. Either VS6 or VS3. See Remark 5. (Character,

6.The connection between the independent points (structural) and the dependent points (aero) is made
through a virtual surface whose mesh is defined by elements listed in the VSLIST (these are either
AERO box id’s or STRUCtural shell elements (CQUAD4, CQUADR, CTRIA3 ,CTRIAR).
7.To bind the points to the virtual surface, a connection is made between the points and the surface
using automatically generated virtual RBE3 elements. Two methods exist to choose which
independent mesh points are connected to each dependent mesh point: nodal-proximity
(NODEPROX) and circular bias (CIRCBIAS).
8.The nodal proximity method selects the closest independent mesh points to each dependent mesh
point. The actual number of points will depend on the user inputs I2VNUM and D2VNUM as well
as collinearity checks. Larger values will spread the connectivity (smearing). Smaller values allow for
more concentration (with additional points added as necessary for collinearity).
9.The circular bias method uses elements of the virtual mesh in an attempt to select independent mesh
points that encircle each dependent mesh point. This method will be restricted to the case where the
virtual mesh is the target mesh.
This method will do the following:
•For each splined dependent mesh node, find the closest NGRID  splined independent mesh
node(s).
•Assemble the list of virtual mesh elements that use the closest node(s).
•Check each of these elements to see if the dependent node projects onto the element in the
element&amp;rsquo;s mean plane normal direction. Note that this check may be computationally expensive,
so it is performed only to the &amp;ldquo;possible&amp;rdquo; elements, not the entire virtual mesh. The projection
check will contain a user-defined tolerance, ELTOL, to expand the area of the element that is
acceptable for a match.
•If the dependent node does not project onto any element, use the candidate element&amp;rsquo;s nodes to
expand the list of elements to check. Repeat the projection check (the original elements will not
be rechecked). Repeat this process up to NCYCLE times.
•All elements that are found to encompass the dependent node (and there may be more than one
due to curvature) will be selected to move forward.
•Assemble the list of all splined nodes that connect the selected elements.
•Generate RBE3 elements based on this node list. An optional user-defined input parameter,
AUGWEI, will be used to augment the RBE3 weighting factors with the following formula:
where NE is the number of elements that are connected with the RBE3 node.weight NE1– = AUGWEI  1+&lt;/p&gt;
