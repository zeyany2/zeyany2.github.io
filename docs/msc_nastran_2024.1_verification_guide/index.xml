About this Guide
The last update of the Verification Manual for MSC Nastran was in 1985. In the years since then, many
features have been added to the program, but the manual has not been updated. This version is an initial
update to bring the manual more up to date. The intent is for this to be a &amp;rsquo;living document&amp;rsquo;, with additional
problems added with each new release of MSC Nastran.
This manual not only contains the original problems from the Verification Manual, but it also contains many
additional problems.
The requirement for a problem to be included in this manual is that there must exist either a theoretical
solution, a solution accepted in published literature, or a published set of test results. MSC tests over 29,000
problems in MSC Nastran daily during the development process and this manual contains a small subset of
those problems.
A section named “MacNeal-Harder Problems” is added. This section contains the set of test problems
proposed by Dr. Richard MacNeal and Bob Harder in 1985. These are problems intended to test how well
the elements perform in varying situations which are known to be difficult for finite elements to handle
properly.
Three sections on newer features in MSC Nastran are added. These are Rotordynamics, SOL 200
Optimization, and SOL 700 Explicit Dynamics. It turns out that it is difficult to find documented examples
in literature with theoretical results or experimental results and a complete description of the structure/model
used, so these sections each have a small set of problems. Many more examples can be found in the associated
User Guides.
The final new section is called NAFEMS. This section contains many of the benchmark problems defined
by NAFEMS ( &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.na&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://www.na&lt;/a&gt; fems.org /).
A standard format is followed for all problems:
Problem Description : a short description of the problem being solved.
Solution Number : the solution used in MSC Nastran to run the problem
Features Used : a short list of features used in solving the problem
Reference : the reference used as a baseline for the problem
Modeling Techniques Used : a short description of the problem and properties/features used
Illustrations of the Model : one or more illustrations of the structure and/or finite element model
Model File Name and Location: the files are delivered with the documentation in a directory called
&amp;rsquo;tpl&amp;rsquo; (test problem library). This provides the name(s) of the file(s) used and the directory where they
can be found.
Results : a short presentation (usually in tabular form) of the results
Conclusion : a summary of the findings&lt;/p&gt;

NAS120 - Linear Static Analysis using MSC Nastran and Patran
This seminar introduces basic finite element analysis techniques for linear static, normal modes, and buckling
analysis of structures using MSC Nastran and Patran. MSC Nastran data structure, the element library,
modeling practices, model validation, and guidelines for efficient solutions are discussed and illustrated with
examples and workshops. Patran will be an integral part of the examples and workshops and will be used to
generate and verify illustrative MSC Nastran models, manage analysis submission requests, and visualize
results. This seminar provides the foundation required for intermediate and advanced MSC Nastran
applications.Superelements and Modules

Theoretical Solution
The net radiation exchange between two “gray” surfaces is given by,
(2.45 -1)
Solving this equation yields,
Note: This is the exact answer obtained when above values are used in the above equation. Text example
contains some round-off error.
MSC Nastran Solution
Total radiation exchange is calculated to be
q =3772.347 Btu/hr
Since the model plates are one square foot each, the flux per square foot is
q =3772.347 Btu/hr-ft2

The simple model can be constructed using bulk data entries directly, or from within any
preprocessor such as PATRAN. Patran can also create the design task as outlined in Chapter 8 of the
MSC Nastran Design Sensitivity and Optimization User&amp;rsquo;s Guide  (DSOUG). Figure 4.1-1 shows the
finite element model which is made up of three rod elements loaded statically with two load cases.
The design task is to minimize the weight of the structure while limiting the displacement in the y
direction at node 4 to be between -0.2 ≤ ≤ 0.2 inches and the stress in the bars to be
-15000 ≤≤20000 psi. The loading for example of this manual differ from that of the DSOUG in
that the 20000 lb loads are applied at a 45° angle.4.1Optimization of a Three Bar

Conclusion
Slight differences are observed between the MSC Nastran result and the Referenced Results, which is typical
for the nonlinear programming tasks involved with optimization. MSC Nastran employs sensitivities to
make the optimization search process more efficient so that a converged result is achieved in 4 design cycles
(5 function evaluations) while the reference uses gradients computed using finite differences, and therefore,
many more function evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;

The simple model can be constructed using bulk data entries directly, or from within any
preprocessor such as PATRAN. Patran can also create the design task as outlined in Chapter 8 of the
MSC Nastran Design Sensitivity and Optimization User&amp;rsquo;s Guide  (DSOUG). The finite element model&lt;br&gt;
is made up of three shear webs with rod elements acting as spar caps on the top and bottom of the
webs. Six CONM2 elements provide nonstructural mass and act to make the design task meaningful
(without these masses, the structural mass and stiffness would be proportional and the design task
would lead to design variables reaching their lower bounds). The design task is to minimize the
weight of the structure while ensuring that the first natural frequency is greater than 20 Hz.

•Caps are modeled by ROD elements

The referenced analysis is from 1967 and used innovative techniques of the time to attack the design task.
The webs of the structure were taken to be piecewise linear with the design variables the thickness at four
spanwise stations. MSC Nastran considered all the elements to be constant thickness so there are three design
variables for the web and another three for the caps (top and bottom caps are taken to be equal). The table

Modeling Techniques Used
The 2-d culvert model is meshed using 27 CQUAD4 elements. A pressure load is applied to the
“road” surface.
The simple model can be constructed using bulk data entries directly, or from within any
preprocessor such as PATRAN. Figure 4.3-1 shows the finite element model. The design task is to
find the shape that minimizes the volume of the structure while modifying the shape of the initially
circular hole. Grid points on the plane of symmetry can move in the y-direction while those at the
base can move in the x-direction. A constraint is placed on the maximum allowable von Mises stress
≤31000 psi. A separate “auxiliary” model is used to create the candidate shape vectors that deforms
the structure while separately applying a radial load to each of the seven grids on the cutout of the
culvert. Stiff beams are added to cutout of this auxiliary model to create smooth deformation due to
the applied point loads.4.3 Shape Design of a Culvert&lt;/p&gt;

Modeling Techniques Used
This MBB example is widely used by academic and industrial researchers for Topology
Optimization validation. A mesh of 4800 CQUAD4 elements represents the structure while a point
load is applied vertically at the top left side of the model. The literature contains numerous
representations of this model with differing dimensions and loading. However, they all have the
same aspect ratio for the beam and apply the load at the same location and direction so that the
topology results can be compared qualitatively regardless of the dimensions/loading/materials.&lt;br&gt;

Problem Description
An aluminum strip clamped at its left and right edges is subjected to an impulsive initial velocity (vz = -132
m/sec) over its central portion (one-fourth of the length).
The purpose is to investigate the sensitivity of the response to Poisson&amp;rsquo;s ratio (  =0.01,  = 0.3) and to check
results against data available from experiments performed at the Air Freight Flight Dynamics Laboratory.
This problem is also presented in the Demonstration Problem Manual- Explicit Nonlinear (SOL 700) .

Modeling Techniques Used
Due to the symmetry of the problem, only half of the strip needs to be modeled (see Figure 5.1-1). The left
hand half strip is discretized by a regular mesh of (30x3) quadrilateral elements.
The MAT1 and MATEP entries are used to input the aluminum elastic-plastic material data.
Since plastic deformations occur, the PSHELL1 entry is used to specify five integration points across the
thickness. The PSHELL1 entry defaults to three integration points.
The SPC entry is used to impose the zero displacement/rotations of the damped left-hand edge and zero out
of-plane displacement/rotations of the right-hand edge (symmetry plane).5.1 Impulsively Loaded Strip&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Verification Guide 222
Main Index
To better represent the actual experimental conditions, the initial velocity distribution is slightly modified so
as to have a smooth transition to the remainder of the strip. The TIC1 entry is used to input initial velocities.
Using the PARAM, INISTEP entry, the initial time step is set to 0.1e-6 sec according to the COURANT
criterion.
The ENDTIME Case Control entry is used to follow the dynamic behavior in the range up to 0.001 seconds.
The Case Control entries TYPE, SAVE, GPOUT, GRIDS, and TIMES are used to build the z displacement
time history of Grid Point 31 (in the plane of symmetry) by saving results every 0.01 msec. The experimental
results are available for every 0.1 msec.

Problem Description
The effect of a detonation on the environment can be simulated by assuming that the detonated material can
be idealized by a sphere of hot gas with a homogeneous density and specific internal energy. This approach
is suited for problems in which the processes inside of the explosive material are not to be investigated.
In this problem, the propagation of a blast wave will be simulated starting from the initial shock front radius
R0=0.05 m at the time t = 0 sec until it reaches a radius of R = 10 R0. Both, the gas in the sphere and the
surrounding environment behave as an ideal gas (Gas Constant = 1.4).

Reference
1.Baker, W. E., Explosions in Air, University of Texas Press, 1973, Austin and London.
Modeling Techniques Used
The motion of the gas is radial. Therefore, only a part of the area of interest need to be analyzed. Here, a mesh
of 20 x 20 x 20 hexahedral Eulerian elements has been used for investigating the volume (0 &amp;lt; x &amp;lt; 0.3 m, 0 &amp;lt;
y &amp;lt; 0.5 m, 0 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 0.5 m). The center of the blast wave is located at the origin of the global coordinate system.
A higher level has to be used to indicate the higher priority of the spherical condition. The value for the
parameter INISTEP has to be below the minimal time step that follows from the Courant Criterion:

Figure 5.2-3 shows pressure profiles in the elements 1 to 20, which are located along the edge y = z = 0 m of
the control volume. The theoretical value of the shock front pressure is also included in this plot. Though
this mesh is very coarse, the analysis results is a fairly good approximation of the theoretical values. Note that
at t = 0, element 2 is not completely inside of the sphere of high energy gas. Therefore, its pressure is below
that of element 1 at t = 0 sec.
Conclusion
Figure 5.2-3  Pressure Contour Plot for Step 50
The contour plot of the pressure in Figure 5.2-3 shows an almost spherical shape of the shock front. Deviations
are due to the fact that mass transport takes place along element faces only. Thus, the relief of pressure is
hampered for the elements on the diagonal.Model File Name Description Location

Due to symmetry, the reaction zone (detonation front) is a plane traveling along the length of the slab.
Therefore, it is sufficient to model only a portion of the slab with all boundary faces closed to transport.
A mesh of 200 elements along the 50 cm of slab length is used (element thickness of 0.25 cm).

Problem Description
The Taylor “bar test” is an important laboratory test in the science of ballistics. It enables to determine an
average value of the dynamic yield stress of a material. It consists of accelerating a cylindrical bar (the velocity
being parallel to the axis of symmetry), and then let the bar hit a rigid target. As a result, the bar shortens and
the impact side expands radially acquiring a mushroom like shape.
Much research work has been done on these impact tests. In this example, the experimental work done by
Johnson/Cook is validated with a number of simulations in SOL 700 with different element types. On top
of this work, the results are compared against the theoretical solution developed by Taylor.
Johnson and Cook developed a material model that represents a constitutive model for materials subjected
to large strains, high strain rates and high temperatures. The SOL 700 implementation is validated for a set
of constitutive constants presented in Reference 1 .

Taylor Test (a rod impacted against a rigid wall)
Main Index
Theoretical Approach - Taylor
Taylor developed a simple expression for the final length of the bar, Lf, as function of the initial length L0,
the impact velocity V, the yield strength y and the density 
The assumptions made in this expression are:
There is a stationary yield front near the wall.
A quasi-steady process is assumed.
Theoretical - Taylor
In Figure 5.4-9, Figure 5.4-10, and Figure 5.4-11 the theoretical reduction in length according to Taylor is
plotted:
Lf /L0 = 0.78
This theoretical reduction is based on an assumption of constant yield of 700 MPa.
Figure 5.4-1  Schematic Overview of the Taylor Impact Test
In this T aylor test, the process stops when all the kinetic energy has converted to plastic work. It is interesting
to note that the governing parameters of the process give a non-dimensional quantity, therefore, the result
depends on this combination and not on the specific value of each parameter.

Conclusion
Although not specifically mentioned, the NAFEMS values are obviously based on Euler beam theory and
ignore the shear flexibility. If Euler beams are used, the results compare well with the NAFEMS expected
values. If shear flexibility is included, then the natural frequencies are slightly lower.Model File Name Description Location

Modeling Techniques Used
A simple flat plate model created using QUAD8 elements (NAFEMS lists 8-noded semi-loof
elements, which do not exist in MSC Nastran). Four different versions are created, using different
mesh refinement and distortion. The first 6 out-of-plane modes are calculated.
Illustrations of the Model
The numbering and locations shown for Test2 are not consistent with the axes and diagrams in the reference.
As such, the locations have been applied to the closest GRID points to the offsets. Also, although it is not
mentioned in the reference, straight lines are drawn between the offset GRID points, so the mid-side nodes
will also be offset to maintain straight edges.6.20FV16- Cantilevered Thin

Conclusion
Considering the number of elements in the models, the program gave excellent results. With square elements,
the results show excellent correlation, considering the mesh and the results for distorted elements are
acceptable, considering the mesh and element distortions. Using the recommendation of 5 GRID points per
half sine-wave of the deformed shape, Test 1 and 2 might be expected to predict mode 1 and possibly mode
2 well and T est 3 and 4 might be expected to predict the first mode well.ModeNAFEMS Expected

While the results using lumped mass are not bad, the results using coupled mass on the 4-noded elements
matches the baseline values within a fraction of a percent. The 8-noded elements match the first 3 modes
almost exactly, but fall off on the last two modes, indicating a need for a more refined mesh.&lt;/p&gt;

Conclusion
The normal recommendation is to have 8 elements per sine wave of the deformed shape. With only 5
elements in the model, the first mode is the only mode which can be expected to be accurate. Modes 1
through 4 are the first bending, axial, and torsional modes and are predicted well using this model. The other
modes are not predicted as well, but mesh refinement would improve the accuracy of these modes.Model Name Description Location

C.Selected Benchmarks for Natural Frequency Analysis, Test No. 5H. Glasgow: NAFEMS, Nov.,

Modeling Techniques Used
A simply supported beam model is solved for a harmonic loading. In the direct method, Rayleigh damping
is used with a0=5.35 and a1=7.46 ×10-5. In the modal approach, modal damping of 2% of critical is used on
the first 16 modes.
A uniform load of 106N/m is applied in the Y-direction over the frequency range from 0.0 to 60.0Hz.
As the NAFEMS baseline does not use residual vectors, they are turned off in the modal solution. In a normal
run, they would be enabled to improve the accuracy of the solution.

Modeling Techniques Used
1.The BAR elements are given section properties for A, I1 and J, as well as I2, the section property in
the loaded direction, so that the model is fully defined in three dimensions.
2.The offsets of the masses provide moments of inertia of the total structure for all directions except
R1. A nominal I1 is therefore added to again give full three-dimensional capability to the model.
3.The enforced acceleration is input on the DMIG cards named UACCEL. The column numbers start
with 1, 0, and would be incremented to 2, 0; 3, 0;&amp;hellip; if there were more loading conditions.
4.The loading condition is applied to the same grid point used as a reference point on the DMIG,
SUPORT, and PARAM, GRDPNT cards.

Theoretical Solution
From symmetry arguments, the loading condition is equivalent to a point load on a cantilevered beam of half
the total length of this beam. The reference gives the load-deflection equation:
Where P3 is the applied load equal to the unit tip mass times the unit acceleration, or unity.
Therefore,
The reaction force is twice the applied load for one side, therefore,Model NameReference Deck

Normal Modes Analysis with Reduction Techniques
Main Index
Results
Theoretical Solution
The reference gives the natural frequency equation as
(2.18 -1)
where 1 is the mass per unit length, n is the mode index and . Approximate equations for thin
walled circular cylinder section properties are:
I = r2t = 0.15708  (2.18 -2)
A = 2rt =0.31416  (2.18 -3)
1 = A =  2.439  x 10-4 (2.18 -4)
Substituting the terms
= 21.8335n2 cycles/second  (2.18 -5)
Conclusion
The model was run using three methods. The inverse power method and Lanczos method involve no
approximation and are used to give a measure of the discretization error caused by using 20 elements with
lumped masses. The error in natural frequency is less than one tenth of one percent, even for worst case.
For Guyan reduction, the error for the first and second mode is well below one percent, the criteria used for
picking the number of A-set points. However, the error rapidly climbs to 60 percent for the sixth mode.Mode

DDAM Method of Response Spectra
Main Index
Problem Description
The purpose of this Verification Problem is to show how to calculate peak structural response estimates in
compliance with the U.S. Navy shock design modal summation convention (knowns as the NRL method).
The NRL convention calls for a choice among modal contributions to peak response
of the maximum, uaM, and summation according to the rule
It is noted that the maximum contributing mode for a particular response is not necessarily the same for all
physical responses.
This problem demonstrates input of a shock spectrum to a frame structure, to calculate internal loads and
accelerations at points on the structure.

Response Spectra of a Single Oscillator
Main Index
Problem Description
A large mass, M1, is subjected to a force doublet. A very small mass, M2, is attached to it with a spring and
damper, tuned to an undamped natural frequency of one Hz. A response spectrum is computed for the large
mass at this same frequency. A variable, v3, is connected by a multipoint constraint and is a model of the
relative displacement between the large and small mass. As the small mass-spring combination has the same
physical model as the response spectrum calculation, it should produce the same results as the inertial motion
component (variable 2) and the relative motion component (variable 3).

Given the same unsymmetric matrix [A] used in problem v10701, find its eigen solution in two steps.
1.Add enough terms to [A] to produce a symmetric matrix. Find the real eigensolution of this matrix
to use as modal coordinates.
2.Add in the terms to reconstruct [A], and compute its eigensolution.
Use the so-called &amp;lsquo;particular&amp;rsquo; matrix [AB] of reference 2 as the symmetric matrix, as it has a closed-form
solution for its eigenvalues. Use the negative of this matrix, as this is more typical of the values encountered

Reference
1.J. P. Den Hartog, Mechanical Vibrations, 4th ed. (New York: McGraw-Hill Book Company, Inc.,
1956) pp. 429-431.
Modeling Techniques Used
1.The model of V10302 is cut through the center grid point, with the plane of symmetry being normal
to the bar centerline. Only the right-hand half is modeled.
2.The only elements entirely in the plane of symmetry are the mass elements. Their values are halved,
because the mirrored component also has these values implicitly. The dihedral symmetry option is
selected.
3.All loads are applied on the plane of symmetry. Full loads are placed on the right hand side, and none
on the left side.
4.Structural damping that provides critical damping at resonance is used. This required a value of twice
the fraction of critical damping, as is input on the card PARAM, G, 2.0.
5.The loads on each degree of freedom are proportional to the stiffness in that direction, to
nondimensionalize the problem (see DAREA cards)2.41Frequency Response of a
Beam-Mass Structure using

6.The default format for frequency response analysis output is the Cartesian form of the complex
number (“RE_IMAG”). By requesting (“PHASE”) on the DISP case control card a polar form
(“MAG_PHASE”) is output instead. The SORT2 option on the DISP card produces a more compact
output.

MSC Nastran Solution
MSC Nastran uses a different sign convention for the phase angle than does the reference. For example, in
the reference, the phase angle for a single degree of freedom system starts at a small positive angle at low
frequency, passes through 900 at resonance, and approaches 1800 at high frequency. In MSC Nastran the
Phase angle traverses the range 3600 through 2700, approaching 1800.
As shown in Problem v10302, each degree of freedom of these single degree of freedom problems has a
different stiffness. A load proportional to stiffness is used to nondimensionalize the solution. (see the
definition of the static deflection Xs on page 49 of the reference and the nondimensional quantity X/Xs.)
The expected solutions should all have the magnitude of one-half and a phase of 2700.
Conclusion
The results from MSC Nastran are comparable to the theoretical results.&lt;/p&gt;

Theoretical Solution
T ransient responses at two points of interest, the free end and the fixed end points are analyzed.
Due to constant force F , applied at the free end, the stress at the free end  is constant at all times.
Before the wave front first reaches the fixed end, the stress at the fixed end is zero. As soon as the wave reaches
the fixed end, it is reflected and produces a stress of  at the fixed end. The stress remains unchanged until
the wave front returns to this point. The compressive wave leaves the fixed end and upon reaching the free
end it is reflected as a tensile stress wave. When this tensile wave arrives at the fixed end and is reflected there,
the stress at this point becomes zero. The zero stress is again unchanged for a complete cycle of the stress wave
motion.
The displacement-time history at the free end can be expressed, in general, as:

Using twenty CONROD elements, the rod is loaded axially at its free end with a step forcing function. The
upper bound stability limit for the time increment is given by
Where,  is the highest natural frequency in cycles/sec of all the interested modes of the corresponding
model. Introduction of small damping in the rod elements is recommended to reduce the high frequency
oscillations in the time history plots.
Comparison of Results
The stress time history plots given in Figure 2.42-1 and Figure 2.42-2 for the free end and fixed end, respectively
show that the MSC Nastran results are consistent with the theoretical ones in their global trends and
characters. The oscillation about the exact solution may be attributed to higher natural frequency modes.

MSC Nastran Solution
The rod is modeled with twenty CONRODs and a GAP element. One end of the rod is constrained
completely and the other is left free axially. One CONM2 is used to represent the mass body, and the mass
value is varied for various ratios of M to m. A gap element connects the CONM2 and the free end of the rod
with a zero initial opening. An initial velocity of v0 = -0.1 m/sec is specified for both the CONM2 and the
free end grid point using TIC cards. A time step is chosen so that twenty vibration modes of the rod model
can be adequately represented. A small damping (0.4% at resonance) is introduced in the rod elements to
smooth out the high frequency oscillations. The consistent mass matrix option (PARAM, COUPMASS) is
recommended for more stable responses.
Comparison of Results
The instant when the stress at the free end (or force in the gap element) vanishes signifies the end of the
impact. The durations of the impact for four distinct values of M/m are determined from MSC Nastran
analyses and compared with the calculations of Saint-Venant in the following table.
