NAS120 - Linear Static Analysis using MSC Nastran and Patran
This seminar introduces basic finite element analysis techniques for linear static, normal modes, and
buckling analysis of structures using MSC Nastran and Patran. MSC Nastran data structure, the element
library, modeling practices, model validation, and guidelines for efficient solutions are discussed and
illustrated with examples and workshops. Patran will be an integral part of the examples and workshops and
will be used to generate and verify illustrative MSC Nastran models, manage analysis submission requests,
and visualize results. This seminar provides the foundation required for intermediate and advanced MSC
Nastran applications.&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction
The Thermal Analysis User’s Guide  describes the heat transfer-specific material within MSC Nastran required for
performing thermal analyses. This book emphasizes fundamental capabilities, describing them in basic
engineering format, and then detailing the interface to MSC Nastran through the Bulk Data entry
descriptions. A series of examples demonstrates a wide cross section of available features and their application
with complete MSC Nastran input listings.
This user’s guide is not intended to provide an exhaustive treatment of heat transfer or finite element theory.
Rather, it is designed to assist in building, analyzing, and designing basic thermal system models and to
numerically study their thermal performance. Some advanced material is included in the appendices to direct
the most efficient use of the more complicated features.
The information contained here can be augmented with material available in the MSC Nastran Getting Started
Guide , MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide , and the MSC Nastran Reference Guide  as well as the MSC Nastran
Handbook for Nonlinear Analysis . These manuals can provide greater depth of coverage regarding finite
element basics, modeling, input file structure, and nonlinear solution techniques.
A complementary product, MSC Patran, is available for performing pre- and post-processing functions for
MSC Nastran Heat T ransfer. This engineering graphics package automates the reading of CAD geometry,
automeshing of the finite element mesh, creation and application of the material properties, loads, boundary
conditions, nonlinear solution control, analysis job submittal, results access, and results visualization. This
product and its application are described in MSC Nastran Preference Guide, Volume II - Thermal Analysis .
Starting with Version 68 there have been substantial modifications made to the MSC Nastran heat transfer
capability. Along with many new and flexible features, a break with the past has occurred in terms of non-
upward compatible Bulk Data entries. The primary areas where non-upward compatibilities arise include the
specification of CHBDY surface elements, boundary and initial conditions, available solution sequences, and
temperature boundary conditions.

Discussion
A simple geometry composed of four plate elements is used to demonstrate radiant exchange in an enclosure.
Every surface to participate in the exchange is identified with an CHBDYi Bulk Data entry surface element,
in this case providing five surface elements. Only one RADCAV Bulk Data entry is defined in this example
indicating that a single enclosure cavity has been defined. For this configuration, shadowing must be
considered when calculating the view factors.
The statements essential to the radiation solution process are described as follows:
RADSET Requests which cavities are to be included as radiation enclosures for the thermal analysis.
RADLST / RADMTX Provides the view factors required for generation of the radiation matrix. Since they are not
provided by the user in this example, they are determined by use of the view module in the
course of the analysis.
RADCAV Provides various global controls used for the calculation of view factors within the identified
cavity.
VIEW Provides the connection between a surface element and its assigned cavity and requests that
view factors be calculated among those surface elements assigned to the same cavity.
VIEW3D Requests that the view factors be calculated using the adaptive gaussian integration  view
factor routine as opposed to the default finite difference calculation.
CHBDYi Describes the surface elements used in the enclosure, and associates them with the VIEW  and
RADM  Bulk Data entries.
RADM Provides the radiative surface properties (emissivity ), in this case a constant value of 1.0.&lt;/p&gt;

Results
The abbreviated EX5a.f06 output file is shown in Listing 5-31. Included in this output is a tabulation of the
view factor calculation. The details of this output are discussed in View Factor Calculation Methods, 481 . Because
the view factor summations are less than 1.0, there is considerable energy lost to space. The punch file of
radiation view factors is shown in Listing 5-32.Note:   The CQUAD4  element with an EID = 2 has two surface  elements associated with it.
The direction of the CHBDYG surface normals are important for any radiation exchange.

Example 5b - Single Cavity Enclosure Radiation with an
Ambient Element Specification
Demonstrated Principles
Enclosure Radiation Exchange
Radiation Ambient Element
Discussion
Example 5a involves four plates in radiative equilibrium which exhibit considerable energy loss to space since
there is no defined exchange mechanism between them and their environment. This undefined environment
behaves mathematically the same as blackbody space at a temperature of absolute zero. A convenient method
for introducing an ambient environment into the problem capitalizes on the use of the ambient element as
selected on the RADCAV  Bulk Data entry. For any group of surface elements we wish to consider as a partial
enclosure, we can define a single unique ambient element which will mathematically complete the enclosure.
This surface element must have a specified temperature boundary condition. H E A T   F L O W   I N T O   H B D Y   E L E M E N T S   (CHBDY)&lt;/p&gt;

Main Index
The ambient element  concept relies on our knowledge that the individual elemental view factors  must add
up to a value of 1.0 for a complete enclosure. Any elemental surfaces which have a view factor sum of less
than 1.0 as determined by the view module will automatically have the remainder assigned to the ambient
element. This environmental view factor is not listed in the view module output, but is identified in the
generated RADLST/RADMTX  punch files. If the ambient element is to model space, it should be made
appropriately large relative to the other elements in the enclosure. As discussed in View Factor Calculation
Methods, 481 , whenever an ambient element is requested for a cavity, a symmetric conservative radiation
matrix is generated.
The MSC Nastran input file is shown in Listing 5-33.&lt;/p&gt;

separation exists between regions. If defined as a single enclosure, this problem would involve third body
shadowing  calculations, the most laborious and expensive part of any view factor calculation. As a three cavity
problem, these calculations are eliminated.
RADSET  selects three cavities and the RADCAV  entry for SHADOW is denoted as NO indicating that no
third body shadowing calculations are to be performed within the individual cavities. The fields on the
VIEW  Bulk Data entry concerning SHADE are ignored when SHADOW is set to NO on the RADCAV&lt;br&gt;
Bulk Data entry. When hundreds or thousands of surfaces are involved, the savings may be crucial to the
economics of the total analysis.

Demonstrated Principles
Forced Convection  Fluid Elements
Control Node  for Mass Flow Rate
Relationships for Tube Flows
Film Nodes  for Forced Convection
Constant Heat Transfer Coefficient
Discussion
A forced convection element (CONVM ) is available for the simulation of 1-D fluid flow networks. The
formulation takes into account conduction and convection in the streamwise direction as well as the
convection resistance between the fluid and the adjoining structure or environment. The mass flow rate is
specified by the value of the control node (CNTMDOT). Fluid properties which vary with temperature are
available through the MAT4/MATT4  entries for conductivity , specific heat , and dynamic viscosity . In this
example, the forced convection heat transfer coefficient has been input at a constant value of 200. W/m2 C.
For tube flow, the heat transfer coefficient could easily have been calculated internally based on the
relationships available through the CONVM/PCONVM.
It may be desirable to consider a fluid flow problem in an evolutionary sense. This allows for a much broader
interpretation of load incrementing through time stepping, as well introducing the stabilizing effects
associated with heat capacitance  and implicit time integration. The steady state solution may then be likened
to the long time solution from a transient analysis.

Transient Plots
Discussion
This example demonstrates the simplest of transient thermal responses. A single CHEXA  element at an initial
temperature of 1000. C is exposed to a free convection environment maintained at 0.0 C. T ransient analysis
involves the time-dependent storage as well as transport of thermal energy. Therefore, relative to steady state
analysis, the heat capacitance (storage) must be accounted for as well as any time dependencies on loads and
boundary conditions. A starting point or initial condition is required and a solution duration is specified.
There are various techniques available for specifying temperature boundary conditions or ambient node
temperatures for transient analyses. If the temperature is to remain constant throughout the analysis, an SPC&lt;br&gt;
should be used to set the boundary condition just as in steady state analysis.
Fundamental MSC Nastran X-Y plotting is demonstrated here for simple transient plots. Interface and File
Communication , 37 discusses this capability in more detail.
The MSC Nastran input file is shown in Listing 5-41.&lt;/p&gt;

An MSC Nastran X-Y plot of temperature versus time is shown in Figure 5-21. These plots were examined by
typing NASPLT EX7A.plt subsequent to the analysis. The EX7A.f06 file has large lists of temperature vs.
time for each grid point, and have been omitted here for the sake of brevity.Note:   TSTEPNL  is identified in the Case Control Section, as are the NASPLT plot requests.
TSTEPNL  provides the solution timing information in the Bulk Data Section.
MAT4  must have density and specific heat field data for transient analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

temperature. In this case, the nonconstant temperature disallows the use of an SPC  for this specification. The
transient form of the TEMPBC  Bulk Data entry is demonstrated. The TEMPBC  is treated with the same
methodology as a thermal load for transient analysis (see Figure 5-22 for input schematic). Note the Case
Control  request for DLOAD  = SID.

Discussion
As discussed in regard to steady state analysis (see Thermal Loads , 14), internal heat generation  is considered to
be a thermal load and as such is Case Control  selectable. In a transient analysis, this allows for using the time
loading scheme illustrated in the previous example (see Figure 5-24). This methodology can be applied to any
SID selectable load.

Demonstrated Principles
Specification of Multiple Loads.
Discussion
There are a number of boundary conditions which are not defined as loads ( Thermal Capabilities , 9) and as a
result cannot be made time varying in the same fashion as described in Example 7c - Time Varying Loads , 218. In
most cases, transient behavior can be introduced into the boundary condition (convection or radiation)
through specification of a control node. The control node can be a simple free grid point, an SPOINT , or an
active degree of freedom in the system. In this example we drive the value of the control node explicitly via
TEMPBC  and related TLOAD1  and TABLED1  statements to produce a free convection heat transfer
coefficient which varies with time. We also demonstrate the use of the DLOAD  statement in the Bulk Data
for applying more than one TLOADi  in the same analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

Temperature Dependent Heat Transfer Coefficient
Discussion
The extension of the temperature dependent free convection heat transfer coefficient is demonstrated for
transient analysis.  The user specification of this capability is treated the same as in the steady state case, but
due to the evolutionary nature of the transient problem, the heat transfer coefficient becomes an implicit
function of time.&lt;/p&gt;

Example 7f - Phase Change
Demonstrated Principles
Capturing Latent Heat  Effects
Appropriate Convergence Criteria
Numerical Damping
Consistent Units
Enthalpy
Discussion
Latent heat effects can be captured by specifying phase change material properties on the MAT4 Bulk Data
entry.  The information required includes the latent heat and a finite temperature range over which the phase
change is to occur.  For pure materials, this range can physically be quite small whereas for solutions or alloys
the range can be quite large.  Numerically, the wider the range the better.  It is not recommended to make
this range less than a few degrees.
Phase change involves the release of considerable amounts of heat while the temperature remains nearly
constant.  In this case, it is beneficial to consider the change in enthalpy as illustrated in Figure 5-37.  The
calculated enthalpies are available with the use of DIAG 50 , 51, or by the Case Control  command
ENTHALPY  = ALL.  The solution sequence for the phase change specific algorithm is discussed in Method
of Solution , 61.
In the cases that follow, the first variation illustrates freezing.  Variation 2 demonstrates melting.&lt;/p&gt;

Transient Analyses
Demonstrated Principles
SPC for Transient Analysis
TEMPBC  for Transient Analysis
SLOAD  and CELASi  for Transient Analysis
Nodal Lumped Heat Capacitance
POINT type CHBDYi
Discussion
A radiative equilibrium analysis is used to demonstrate different methods of temperature specification for
transient analyses.  As discussed in Thermal Capabilities , 9, an SPC is used when the temperature is to remain
constant for the duration of the analysis (Variation 1).  When the temperature is to vary during the analysis,
two methods are available.  A TEMPBC of type TRAN, or a CELASi with applied SLOAD can be used.
When a TEMPBC is implemented (Variation 2), a thermal conductivity matrix element of magnitude of
1.0E+10 is imposed internally in the form of a penalty method.  For many problems this will be adequate for
maintaining the grid point temperature while facilitating convergence.  In some cases, however, the size of
this conductance can be overwhelming with respect to those of the rest of the model.  In such a case, it may
be difficult to satisfy the convergence criteria due to the dominance of one matrix conductance value.
The alternative approach to this problem is to use a CELASi  element and specify a consistent conductance
or stiffness value for the model in question (Variation 3).  The QHBDY  power level can be adjusted to
maintain the desired temperature.

Demonstrated Principles
Diurnal Heat Loads
Multiple Loads  / Multiple CHBDYi’s
Discussion
A diurnal heat transfer analysis is performed over a two day cycle.  The TLOAD2 Bulk Data entry is used to
specify the load function (QVECT ) in convenient sinusoidal format.  A radiation boundary condition&lt;br&gt;
provides the heat loss mechanism to an ambient environment at 300 degrees.  In Example 9a, the absorptivity
and emissivity are constant and the loading is a function of time based on the load magnitude which reflects
a projected area without treating the QVECT as a vector load.
In Example 9b - Diurnal Thermal Cycles , 269, the variation of absorptivity with respect to time is added to the
problem.

Figure 5-45  Example 9a
Sun heating aluminum plate over two days.
Solar flux  = 750 W /m2 at noon.  Plate is one square meter and 0.005 meters thick.  Ambient
temperature is 300 K.
Solar flux magnitude varies sinusoidally with an amplitude of 750.0 W/m2, and a period of one day.
CHBDYG 10 absorbs heat for the first day.
CHBDYG 20 absorbs heat for the second day.
CHBDYG 30 radiates heat both days.
Example 9b only:
Grid 50 is the control node on the QVECT entry.  It is forced to vary with time as absorptivity ( a)
varies with the “attack” angle of the sun, i.e.,
So the value of  UCNTRLND  equals  a t any given time (or any given angle:  18012 hr =

Absorptivity is set to 1.0 on the RADM card so that UCNTRLND  will act as absorptivity:Day 1 Day 2

Multiple Loads / Multiple CHBDYi’s
Control Node  for Directionally Dependent Radiation Surface Properties
Discussion
The loading pattern is substantially unchanged from the previous example; however, the effect of variation
of surface absorptivity  with angle of incident solar radiation is taken into account implicitly via the control
node.  As in the previous example, we provide independent CHBDY  surface elements for each load and
boundary condition specification resulting in a total of three surface elements attached to the conduction
element.  This can sometimes be convenient for postprocessing if we wish to isolate applied load segments
of the same type.

NOLINs  and MPCs
Thermostat Control
Discussion
A thermostat is modeled using the nonlinear transient forcing function (NOLIN3 ) as a heating element and
the multi-point constraint (MPC) relationship to provide the thermostat connections.  One end of the rod
element structure has the thermocouple attached to it and is subject to convective losses to the ambient
environment at 0.0 C.  When this local temperature drops below 100.0 C, heating occurs at the opposite
end of the structure at a constant rate.  Conversely, when the thermocouple temperature exceeds 100.0 C,
the heat load is removed.  There is an inherent delay in this system associated with the distance between the
thermocouple and the point of application of the heat load as well as the delay generated as a result of the
thermal diffusivity of the material.

Example 11 - Transient Forced Convection
Demonstrated Principle
Evolving Fluid Transients
Discussion
It may be desirable to consider fluid flow problems from a transient view point.  In particular, fluid loops
when used in conjunction with the thermostat control described in Example 10 - Thermostat Control , 276 are most
useful in transient analysis.  Accurate temporal response requires some user control be exerted over the
Courant Number  as discussed in Thermal Capabilities , 9.
In some cases, where steady state convergence is difficult or impossible to achieve, it may prove beneficial to
let the transient system evolve toward its long time solution, thereby achieving the steady state equivalent.&lt;br&gt;
The transient analysis has inherent damping associated with the heat capacitance and can also utilize
numerical damping  through the NDAMP  parameter.  Additionally, loading patterns can be applied gradually
with respect to time in an ad hoc load incrementing scheme which may prove more flexible than the load
incrementing which is available in the steady state solution sequence.

Discussion
Thermal loads (QVOL, QVECT , QBDY3) can be thermostatically controlled by including a CONTRLT
Bulk Data entry in the model.  A schematic of the process is given in Figure 5-58.
Figure 5-58&lt;br&gt;
This capability provides thermal control for heating elements with these features:
1.Sensor temperature can be measured from any GRID or scalar point in the model.
2.Numerous switch formats are available with user-defined deadbands.
3.The sensor (thermacouple) can be continuously monitored or it can be evaluated at a user-defined
sampling rate starting from TIME = 0.0 When the sensor is sampled, the control logic is evaluated
and any necessary control action is enforced.
4.The control device can account for physical actuator time delay and rise and decay time constants.Switch Status = Off
Switch Status = OnPL

Example 13 - Cryogenic Heat Shielding
Demonstrated Principles
Axisymmetric View Factors
Multiple Cavities
Radiation Matrix Control
Discussion
A study is performed to examine the effects of multiple radiation shields for maintaining a cryogenic
environment. The number of cylindrical layers of material as well as the surface emissivities are varied and
the total heat flow for each variation is recovered.
The radiation exchange can be modeled in several ways. If each radiation gap is treated as an individual cavity,
then the minimum number of view factor calculations will be performed. In this case, the surface exchange
elements should be designated as can shade for the element on the inner radius and can be shaded for the
element on the outer radius. These designations are made on the shade field on the VIEW Bulk Data entry.
For axisymmetric view factor calculations, it will often be difficult to set the shadowing flags correctly. The
user may find it easier to make shade = both in these instances and pay a penalty in CPUs.
If a multiple cavity approach is used, then there will be a RADLST and RADMTX for each cavity. Using a
single cavity approach, all the radiation surface elements are entered on a single RADLST , and the VIEW3D
routine automatically sorts out those that can see each other and determines the magnitude of the
axisymmetric view factors between each active pair. The accuracy of the axisymmetric view factors can be
controlled in several ways. The process used in MSC Nastran relies on internally creating a semi-circle of
computational elements and applying symmetry arguments in forming the view factor between REV type
surface elements. This is described in greater detail in Appendix . Since the core or component view factors
are computed using the generalized 3D methods (Gaussian/contour integrations with error corrections),
similar modeling principles apply. A good model will select NCOMP (field 9 on RADCAV) to generate
elements that are approximately square.
The model represents az-slice of a container configuration, however, nothing special has been included in the
model to prevent the exchange surfaces from communicating with the external environment. This can be
controlled by setting the MTXTYP = 4 on the RADLST Bulk Data entry. The flow of heat is then purely
radial with no exchange with space.

Format:
Examples:
TEMPERATURE(LOAD)=15
TEMPERATURE(MATERIAL)=7
TEMPERATURE=7
Remarks:
1.In linear analysis, only one temperature-dependent material request should be made in any problem
and should be specified above the subcase level.  If multiple requests are made, then only the last
request will be processed.  See also Remarks 6. and 7.
2.The total load applied will be the sum of external (LOAD command), thermal (TEMP(LOAD)
command), element deformation (DEFORM command) and constrained displacement (SPC
command) loads.
3.Static, thermal, and element deformation loads should have unique set identification numbers.TEMPERATURE Temperature Set Selection
Describer Meaning
MATERIAL The selected temperature set will be used to determine temperature-dependent
material properties indicated on the MATTi Bulk Data entries.  See Remarks 6., 7. and
8.
LOAD The selected temperature set will be used to determine an equivalent static load and
to update material properties in a nonlinear analysis.  See Remarks 2., 5., 6. and 7.
BOTH Both MATERIAL and LOAD will use the same temperature set.
n Set identification number of TEMP , TEMPD, TEMPP1, TEMPRB, TEMPF , or

4.INITIAL is used in steady state heat transfer analysis for conduction material properties and provides
starting values for iteration.
5.In superelement data recovery restarts, TEMPERATURE(LOAD) requests must be respecified in the
Case Control Section.
6.In linear static analysis, temperature strains are calculated with:
where A(T0) is the thermal expansion coefficient defined on the MATi Bulk Data entries, T is the load
temperature defined with TEMPERATURE(LOAD) and T0 is the initial temperature defined with
TEMPERATURE(INITIAL). The following rules apply for TEMPERATURE(INITIAL),
TEMPERATURE(MATERIAL), and TREF on the MATi entries:
•If TEMPERATURE(INITIAL) and TREF are specified, then the TEMPERATURE(INITIAL)
set will be used as the initial temperature to calculate both the loads and the material properties.
•If TEMPERATURE(MATERIAL) and TREF are specified, then TREF will be used as the initial
temperature in calculating the load and the TEMPERATURE(MATERIAL) set will be used for
the calculation of material properties.
•If no TEMPERATURE(INITIAL) or TEMPERATURE(MATERIAL) is present, TREF will be
used to calculate both the load and the material properties.
7.In nonlinear static analysis, temperature strains are calculated with
where  A(T) is the thermal expansion coefficient defined on the MATi Bulk Data entries.  T is the load
temperature defined with TEMPERATURE(LOAD) and  T0 is the initial temperature defined with
TEMPERATURE(INITIAL). The following rules apply
•The specification of TEMPERATURE(INITIAL) is required above the subcase level.  The
specification of TEMPERATURE(MATERIAL) or TEMPERATURE(BOTH) will cause a fatal
error.
•If a subcase does not contain a TEMPERATURE(LOAD) request, then the thermal load set will
default to the TEMPERATURE(INITIAL) set.
•TEMPERATURE(LOAD) will also cause the update of temperature-dependent material
properties due to the temperatures selected in the thermal load set.  Temperature-dependent
material properties are specified with MATi, MATTi, MATS1, and/or TABLEST Bulk Data
entries.
•If TREF and TEMPERATURE(INITIAL) are specified, then the TEMPERATURE(INITIAL)
set will be used as the initial temperature to calculate both the loads and the material properties.&lt;br&gt;
Both are used in the definition of thermal strain.
8.TEMPERATURE(MATERIAL) and TEMPERATURE(INITIAL) cannot be specified
simultaneously in the same run.
9.TEMP(INIT) is not used with TEMPAX.TATo = TTo–

Area Type Sides –The first side is that given by the right -hand rule on the shell elements grid points.
Line Type Sides –The second side (first line) proceeds from grid point 1 to grid point 2 of the shell
element, and the remaining lines are numbered consecutively.  The thickness of the line is that of the
shell element, and the normal to the line is outward from the shell element in the plane of the shell.&lt;br&gt;
Note that any midside nodes are ignored in this specification.
8.Side conventions for line elements.
LINE elements have one linear side (side 1) with geometry that is the same as that of the element and
two POINT -type sides corresponding to the two points bounding the linear element (first grid point-
side 2; second grid point-side 3).
The TUBE -type element has two linear sides of type TUBE.  The first side represents the outside with
diameters equal to that of the outside of the tube.  The second side represents the inside with
diameters equal to that of the inside of the tube.
Point Sides – Point sides may be used with any linear element.  The direction of the outward normals
of these points is in line with the element axis, but pointing away from the element.  The area assigned
to these POINT -type sides is consistent with the element geometry.
Rev Sides –The CTRIAX6 element has associated with it three REV sides.  The first side is associated
with Grid Points G1, G2, and G3.  The positive face identification normals point away from the
element.
9.Application of boundary conditions to CHBDYE is referenced through the EID.  Boundary
conditions can reference either the front or back face of the CHBDYE by specifying +EID or -EID
respectively.  Correspondingly, the back face is minus the normal vector of the front face.  Similarly,
IVIEWF and RADMIDF are associated with +EID and IVIEWB and RADMIDB with -EID.  For
radiation problems, if the RADMIDF or RADMIDB is zero, default radiant properties assume
perfect black body behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction to Thermal Capabilities
This chapter covers the following topics:
Element types and uses.
Material properties and consistent units.
Thermal loads and application.
Convection and radiation boundary conditions.
Enclosure radiation.
Temperature boundary conditions and constraints.
Initial conditions.
Elements
MSC Nastran is an analysis code based on the finite element method. Fundamental to the method is an
element library, available for building discretized numerical models that approximate the structure or system
of interest. Several categories of elements exist to facilitate model generation: conduction elements, surface
elements, and specialty elements.
Conduction Elements
Conduction elements are defined by the configuration generated when geometric grid points are connected
in specific orientations and, for heat transfer, obey Fourier’s Law. These elements can be characterized
geometrically as being either one, two, or three dimensional, or axisymmetric. Besides being associated with
geometry, these elements have the material properties for thermal conductivity, density, and specific heat
associated with them. A typical element definition Bulk Data entry is given below for a 2-D element:

Surface Elements
Wherever a boundary condition is applied to the surface of a conduction element, it must be interfaced with
a surface element. Surface elements provide the geometric connection between the structural conduction
elements and the applied convection, radiation, or heat flux loads. In particular, surfaces that participate in
radiation enclosures derive their cavity identity and their radiation material property pointers from the
surface element Bulk Data description. Similarly, free- and forced-convection Bulk Data entries are identified
through their mating surface element identification numbers.
Surface Elements Available for Defining Heat Transfer Boundaries
The following table presents the surface elements available for convection and radiation boundary conditions
and certain applied heat flux loads.
Surface element geometries are associated with surface types. Of the three forms of surface elements, the
CHBDYG and the CHBDYP have their TYPE explicitly defined on their Bulk Data entries. The CHBDYE
deals with the geometry type implicitly by reference to the underlying conduction element. The surface
element Bulk Data entries are given below:CONROD CTRIA6

Special Elements
Several types of special elements are available for added modeling flexibility. Simple resistive components are
represented by CELASi  (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) elements. More complicated elements can be introduced into the
system through generalized matrix input in the form of DMI, DMIG, and TF .
Lumped thermal capacitance  can be defined with the use of CDAMPi  (i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) entries.
Key Points Regarding Elements
All element Bulk Data connection inputs signify that an element connection is performed among
grid points.
Every element must have a unique element identification number (EID) with respect to all other
elements in the problem. This requirement applies to conduction elements, surface elements, and
specialty elements.
Element definitions reference Bulk Data property entries that supply supplemental information
about geometry and governing relationships, and subsequently refer to material property entries.
Material Properties
Material properties for heat transfer analysis are supplied on MAT4 , MAT5, MATT4, MATT5, RADM , and
RADMT  entries. The MAT4, MAT5, and RADM entries provide constant valued material properties, while
their companion entries MATT4, MATT5, and RADMT supply information about temperature-dependent
properties through reference to material tables (TABLEMi  (i = 1, 2, 3, 4)). The fields available on the material
entries are described below.

Key Points Regarding Material Properties
It is the user’s responsibility to enforce consistent and rational units for material properties as well as
for applied loads, boundary conditions, geometry, and various physical constants.
Although the surface characteristics for free convection (heat transfer coefficient) and radiation
(emissivity and absorptivity) are not normally considered to be material properties, they are
included in the above entries.
Temperature dependence of the quantity of interest is ultimately defined on a TABLEMi  entry. The
table is connected to the MAT4  through the MATT4  entry. Most material properties are directed
toward a structural element and are referenced by the property entry for the element of interest.(T) Dynamic Viscosity * N sec/m2

Thermal Loads
MSC Nastran makes a clear distinction between loads and boundary conditions. This distinction refers more
to solution sequence methods than with the physical phenomena involved. In general, the specification of
surface flux and internal heat generation are defined as loads. Loads are readily identified from their Bulk
Data entries because they possess a load set identification (SID) . This identifier has ramifications regarding
the application of the load via Case Control. Case Control is discussed briefly in Interface and File
Communication, 37 , but is introduced here for clarity.
The Case Control Section :
Selects loads and constraints (temperature boundary condition).
Requests printing, plotting, and/or punching of input and output data (plot commands are
discussed in the MSC Nastran Reference Guide  and Interface and File Communication  of this guide). Punch
files are generally intermediate files of data saved for use in a subsequent computation. Two
common examples for heat transfer are the punch files of view factors that result from an execution
of the VIEW MODULE, and a punch file of temperatures from a thermal solution to be used in a
subsequent thermal-stress analysis.
Defines the subcase structure for the analysis.
For the current discussion, consider the selection of loads. In order to activate any of the loads stipulated in
the Bulk Data Section, a load request must be made from the Case Control Section.
Key Points in Requesting Loads from Case Control
LOAD  = SID; where SID is an integer used in steady state analysis (SOL 153) to request application
of the load Bulk Data labeled with the given SID. Only one LOAD command per subcase may be
specified in the Case Control Section.
DLOAD  = SID; used in transient analysis (SOL 159) to request the application of the dynamic load
Bulk Data with the given SID. Only one DLOAD command per subcase may be specified in the
Case Control Section.
For steady state analysis , any number of loads defined in the Bulk Data may be referenced from a
single Case Control request by specifying all loads of interest to have the same SID.
For transient analysis , the static load entries are not selected by the Case Control SID; rather, they
reference a TLOADi  entry (DAREA field). The SID required for Case Control selection is given on
the TLOADi  entry (SID field). The schematic for this process is illustrated below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 CHAPTER 2
Thermal Capabilities
Main Index
Unlike the steady state case where many loads may utilize the same SID, every TLOADi entry must
have a unique SID. To apply multiple loads in a transient analysis, the multiple TLOADi first must
be combined using a DLOAD Bulk Data entry. The SID on the DLOAD Bulk Data entry then
becomes the reference SID on the DLOAD Case Control command.
Nonlinear transient forcing functions (NOLINi) are requested in Case Control with the
NONLINEAR  = SID command. They are only available for transient analysis and cannot be
referenced on the DLOAD  Bulk Data entry.

Convection and Radiation Boundary Conditions
The specification of boundary conditions was introduced in Elements . MSC Nastran treats the application of
radiation and convection as boundary conditions. Unlike flux loads, convection and radiation are therefore
not Case Control selectable. The implications of this are twofold. In transient analysis, the transient load
methodology (see Thermal Loads ) is unavailable, and in steady state analysis, the solution sequence mechanism
for load incrementing does not apply. T o mitigate these shortcomings, transient control is introduced into
the boundary conditions through the use of the control node. In addition, although the ability to do load
incrementing is lost for these boundary conditions, their inclusion in a comprehensive tangent matrix
significantly enhances both the overall stability and convergence rate.
Available Boundary Conditions
Free Convection Application
Free convection heat transfer is available through the CONV Bulk Data entry. In MSC Nastran, free
convection is governed by relationships of the following forms:
 q = H   (T-TAMB )expf (T-TAMB )
 q = H uCNTRLND  (T-TAMB )expf (T-TAMB )
 q = H (T expf -TAMB expf )
 q = H  uCNTRLND  (T expf -TAMBexpf )

Free convection allows thermal communication between a surface and an ambient environment
through a heat transfer coefficient (H) and a surface element (CHBDYi).
Free convection heat transfer coefficients are supplied on MAT4  Bulk Data entries. The coefficient
can be made temperature dependent by using the MATT4  entry.
The access temperature for the temperature-dependent coefficient can be varied by specifying the
film node  field (FLMND on CONV ).
Time dependence can be introduced into the heat transfer coefficient through the control node&lt;br&gt;
entry (CNTRLND on CONV).

Forced Convection Application
Streamwise-upwind Petrov-Galerkin Element (SUPG )
Forced convection is available through the CONVM  Bulk Data entry. Forced convection in MSC Nastran
is limited to one-dimensional fluid flows. An SUPG element  formulation allows for energy transport due to
streamwise advection and diffusion and displays good spatial and temporal accuracy. Heat transfer between
the fluid stream and the surroundings is accounted for through a forced convection heat transfer coefficient
based on locally computed Reynolds  and Prandtl  numbers. The pertinent heat transfer behavior is listed as
follows:
1.Streamwise energy transport due to advection plus streamwise diffusion
a.FLAG = 0 , no convective flow
b.FLAG = 1 , diffusion and convection transport
2.Heat transfer coefficient to fluid tube wall
a.
b.
Key Points - Forced Convection
Controlling Mass Flow Rate.  The actual mass flow rate is specified by using a control node  for
mass flow, the CNTMDOT field on the CONVM Bulk Data entry. For forced convection, the
control node can supply active or passive/local or remote system mass flow rate control. It is the
user’s responsibility to ensure continuity of mass flow rate from element to element.
The material properties of interest for determining energy transport and forced convection heat
transfer coefficients are given on the MAT4  Bulk Data entries. Temperature-dependent material
properties are given through the MATT4  statement, and a film node is available for the look-up
temperature. The heat transfer coefficient (H) given on the MAT4 statement is for free convection
ONLY.
As with all boundary conditions, CONVM can only communicate to the structure through a
surface element. The CHBDYP  specification is identified on the CONVM entry as the EID field.whereIf FORM = 0then h = coefReEXPRPrEXPP   

Courant Number  for Forced Convection . Time dependence can be introduced into the flow
field mass flow rate through the control node (CNTMDOT on CONVM). Accurate resolution of
the evolving flow field (transient analysis) requires some user control over the Courant number&lt;br&gt;
(CN).
where :
For good resolution of transient flow fields, it is recommended that CN .10. Since the element
length and mass flow rate are specified, this implies that the user must control the time step size. This
may eliminate the use of the automatic time step selection scheme.
Radiation to Space
A radiation boundary condition can be specified with a RADBC  Bulk Data entry. This form of radiant
exchange is solely between the surface element and a blackbody space node. The following relationships
apply:
1.If CNTRLND  = 0,&lt;br&gt;
2.If CNTRLND  &amp;gt; 0,
Key Points - Radiation Boundary Conditions
Two PARAMETERS  are required for any radiation calculation to be performed:
TABS  - Defines the absolute temperature  scale.
SIGMA  - The Stefan-Boltzmann constant .
PARAMETERS are discussed in Parameters  in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide . For these
Bulk Data Section PARAMETERS, the statement would look like:
PARAM,SIGMA,5.67E-08
PARAM,TABS,273.16
The emissivity and absorptivity material surface properties are specified on the RADM  Bulk Data
entry. They may be constant, temperature-dependent (RADM/RADMT ), and/or wavelength band-
dependent (RADM/RADBND ).V=Velocity of fluid

Wavelength dependence is specified in a piecewise linear curve fashion with discrete break points
defined on a RADBND Bulk Data entry. There can only be one set of break points in any given
analysis, and any RADM definition must have break points that are coincident with those on the
solitary RADBND. The theoretical treatment within MSC Nastran of spectral radiation effects are
discussed in some detail in Radiation Exchange – Real Surface Approximation .
As with all boundary conditions, RADBC may only be used when it is applied to a surface element
(CHBDYi ).
Time dependence can be introduced into the RADBC in two ways. The Control Node Multiplier
(CNTRLND) can be made to follow a specified time function, and the temperature of the ambient
node (NODAMB) can be a function of time. Each has a unique effect on the overall heat transfer.
RADBC is the only Bulk Data entry besides QVECT  that uses the material’s absorptivity property
in its calculations. For all enclosure radiation calculations, absorptivity is assumed to be equal to
emissivity.
Enclosure Radiation Exchange
Thermal radiation exchange among a group of surface elements is treated as a radiation enclosure. Defining
radiation enclosures and accounting for the subsequent radiation heat transfer can be the most complicated
and computationally expensive thermal calculation. As with the radiation boundary condition, the material
surface properties can be constant, temperature dependent, and/or wavelength dependent. One of the more
troublesome aspects of enclosure exchange is the geometric concept of view factors that relate the relative
levels of radiant exchange between any and all individual surfaces in the enclosure set. A number of options
are available for the calculation of view factors for black or gray diffuse surface character. View Factor Calculation
Methods  describes the basis for enclosure exchange and the view factor calculation methods.
1.Enclosure options:
MSC Nastran is used to calculate the diffuse view factors using one of its two view factor modules.
Once generated, the RADLST/RADMTX  punch files can be retained for use in subsequent thermal
runs that utilize the same geometry. Since view factor calculations tend to be lengthy, calculating
them once and then reusing them is the preferable procedure. The INCLUDE  Bulk Data entry is
used to identify the view factor files to be used in the subsequent thermal analyses.
View factors or exchange factors can be determined independently outside of MSC Nastran and used
in MSC Nastran Thermal Analysis if the formats are consistent with the RADLST/RADMTX files
that MSC Nastran generates. The RADLST  Bulk Data entry defines the type of matrix being used.
2.Calculation process - Radiant enclosure exchange where the view factors exist
a.All conduction element surfaces involved in a radiation enclosure must be identified with
surface elements (CHBDYi ). The CHBDYi description of the surface element identifies the
surface material entry (RADM ). Multiple (and mutually exclusive) cavities may be defined
within MSC Nastran for modeling convenience, and to minimize the computation time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Thermal Analysis User’s Guide
Convection and Radiation Boundary Conditions28
Main Index
b.When the RADLST/RADMTX entries are available for the analysis, view factors need not
be calculated. This is true as long as the existing RADLST/RADMTX entries are either
already in the Bulk Data Section or are included in the input file through the Bulk Data
INCLUDE entry. A punch file of view factors may have been generated in a prior run.
c.Including radiant enclosure exchange in an analysis is requested using the RADSET  entry.
RADSET identifies those cavities to be considered for enclosure radiation exchange.
d.For an analysis where the view factors exist then, the following Bulk Data entries constitute
the minimum required subset:
CHBDYi
RADLST
RADMTX
RADSET
RADM / RADMT / RADBND
In addition to these entries, include the parameters SIGMA  and TABS.
The above process is illustrated in the following schematic.&lt;/p&gt;

Remarks:
1.In order to use the DMI feature, the user must write a DMAP, or make alterations to a solution
sequence that includes the DMIIN module.  See the MSC Nastran DMAP Programmer’s Guide .  All
of the rules governing the use of data blocks in DMAP sequences apply.
2.The total number of DMIs and DTIs may not exceed 1000.
3.Field 3 of the header entry must contain an integer of zero (0).
4.For symmetric matrices, the entire matrix must be input.
5.Only nonzero terms need be entered.
6.Leading and trailing zeros in a column do not have to be entered.  However, a blank field between
nonzero fields on this entry is not equivalent to a zero.  If a zero input is required, the appropriate
type zero must be entered (i.e., 0.0 or 0.0D0).
7.Complex input must have both the real and imaginary parts entered if either part is nonzero; i.e., the
zero component must be input explicitly.
8.If A(Ix,J) is followed by &amp;ldquo;THRU&amp;rdquo; in the next field and an integer row number &amp;ldquo;IX&amp;rdquo; after the THRU,
then A(lx,J) will be repeated in each row through IX.  The &amp;ldquo;THRU&amp;rdquo; must follow an element value.&lt;br&gt;
For example, the entries for a real matrix RRR would appear as follows:
These entries will cause the first column of the matrix RRR to have a zero in  row 1, the values 1.0
in rows 2 through 10, a zero in row 11, and 2.0 in row 12.TOUT Type of matrix being output, as follows:  (Integer)

Remarks:
1.Matrices defined on this entry may be used in dynamics by selection in the Case Control with
K2PP =NAME, B2PP =NAME, M2PP =NAME for [ Kpp], [Bpp], or [ Mpp], respectively.  Matrices
may also be selected for all solution sequences by K2GG =NAME, B2GG =NAME, and
M2GG =NAME.  The g -set matrices are added to the structural matrices before constraints are
applied, while p -set matrices are added in dynamics after constraints are applied.  Load matrices may
be selected by P2G =NAME for dynamic and superelement analyses.
2.The header entry containing IFO, TIN and TOUT is required.  Each nonnull column is started with
a GJ, CJ pair.  The entries for each row of that column follows.  Only nonzero terms need be entered.&lt;br&gt;
The terms may be input in arbitrary order.  A GJ, CJ pair may be entered more than once, but input
of an element of the matrix more than once will produce a fatal message.
3.Field 3 of the header entry must contain an integer 0.
4.For symmetric matrices (IFO =6), a given off -diagonal element may be input either below or above
the diagonal.  While upper and lower triangle terms may be mixed, a fatal message will be issued if an
element is input both below and above the diagonal.
5.The recommended format for rectangular matrices requires the use of NCOL and IFO =9.  The
number of columns in the matrix is NCOL.  (The number of rows in all DMIG matrices is always
either p -set or g -set size, depending on the context.)  The GJ term is used for the column index.  The
CJ term is ignored.
6.If NCOL is not used for rectangular matrices, two different conventions are available:
•If IFO =9, GJ and CJ will determine the sorted sequence, but will otherwise be ignored; a
rectangular matrix will be generated with the columns submitted being in the 1 to N positions,
where N is the number of logical entries submitted (not counting the header entry).POLAR Input format of Ai, Bi.  (Integer=blank or 0 indicates real, imaginary format; Integer &amp;gt;0
indicates amplitude, phase format.)
NCOL Number of columns in a rectangular matrix.  Used only for IFO =9. See Remarks 5. and 6.

GJ Grid, scalar or extra point identification number for column index.  (Integer &amp;gt;0)
CJ Component number for grid point GJ.  (0 &amp;lt;Integer &amp;lt;6; blank or zero if GJ is a scalar or
extra point.)
Gi Grid, scalar, or extra point  identification number for row index.  (Integer &amp;gt;0)
Ci Component number for Gi for a grid point.  ( ; blank or zero if Gi is a scalar or
extra point.)

Main Index
•If IFO =2, the number of columns of the rectangular matrix will be equal to the index of the
highest numbered non -null column (in internal sort).  Trailing null columns of the g - or p -size
matrix will be truncated.
7.The matrix names must be unique among all DMIGs.
8.TIN should be set consistent with the number of decimal digits required to read the input data
adequately.  For a single -precision specification on a short -word machine, the input will be truncated
after about eight decimal digits, even when more digits are present in a double -field format.  If more
digits are needed, a double precision specification should be used instead.  However, note that a
double precision specification requires a “D” type exponent even for terms that do not need an
exponent.  For example, unity may be input as 1.0 in single precision, but the longer form 1.0D0 is
required for double precision.
9.On long -word machines, almost all matrix calculations are performed in single precision and on
short -word machines, in double precision.  It is recommended that DMIG matrices also follow these
conventions for a balance of efficiency and reliability.  The recommended value for TOUT is 0,
which instructs the program to inspect the system cell that measures the machine precision at run
time and sets the precision of the matrix to the same value.  TOUT =0 allows the same DMIG input
to be used on any machine.  If TOUT is contrary to the machine type specified (for example, a
TOUT of 1 on a short -word machine), unreliable results may occur.
10. If any DMIG entry is changed or added on restart then a complete re -analysis is performed.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore, DMIG entry changes or additions are not recommended on restart.&lt;/p&gt;

Remarks:
1.The NLPARM entry  is selected by the Case Control command NLPARM =ID.  Each solution
subcase requires an NLPARM command.
2.In cases of static analysis (DT =0.0) using Newton methods, NINC is the number of equal
subdivisions of the load change defined for the subcase.  Applied loads, gravity loads, temperature
sets, enforced displacements, etc., define the new loading conditions.  The differences from the
previous case are divided by NINC to define the incremental values.  In cases of static analysis
(DT =0.0) using arc -length methods, NINC is used to  determine the initial arc -length for the
subcase, and the number of load subdivisions will not be equal to NINC.  In cases of creep analysis
(DT &amp;gt;0.0), NINC is the number of time step increments.
3.The unit of DT must be consistent with the unit used on the CREEP entry that defines the creep
characteristics.  Total creep time for the subcase is DT multiplied by the value in the field NINC;
i.e., DT*NINC.
4.The stiffness update strategy is selected in the KMETHOD field.
•If the AUTO option is selected, the program automatically selects the most efficient strategy
based on convergence rates.  At each step the number of iterations required to converge is
estimated.  Stiffness is updated, if (i) estimated number of iterations to converge exceeds
MAXITER, (ii) estimated time required for convergence with current stiffness exceeds the
estimated time required for convergence with updated stiffness, and (iii) solution diverges.  See
Remarks 9. and 13. for diverging solutions.
•If the SEMI option is selected, the program for each load increment (i) performs a single iteration
based upon the new load, (ii) updates the stiffness matrix, and (iii) resumes the normal AUTO
option.MAXLS Maximum number of line searches allowed for each iteration.  See Remark 11. (Integer &amp;gt;0;
Default =4)
FSTRESSFraction of effective stress  used to limit the subincrement size in the material routines.&lt;br&gt;
See Remark 12. (0.0 &amp;lt;Real &amp;lt;1.0; Default =0.2)
LSTOL Line search tolerance.  See Remark 11. (0.01 &amp;lt;Real &amp;lt;0.9; Default =0.5)
MAXBIS Maximum number of bisections allowed for each load increment.  See Remark 13. (-
10&amp;lt;MAXBIS &amp;lt;10; Default =5)
MAXR Maximum ratio for the adjusted arc -length increment relative to the initial value.  See
Remark 14. (1.0 &amp;lt;MAXR &amp;lt;40.0; Default =20.0)
RTOLB Maximum value of incremental rotation (in degrees) allowed per iteration to activate
bisection.  See Remark 15. (Real &amp;gt;2.0; Default =20.0)Field Contents

•If the ITER option is selected, the program updates the stiffness matrix at every KSTEP iterations
and on convergence if KSTEP &amp;lt;MAXITER.  However, if KSTEP &amp;gt;MAXITER, stiffness matrix
is never updated.  Note that the Newton -Raphson iteration strategy is obtained by selecting the
ITER option and KSTEP =1, while the Modified Newton -Raphson iteration strategy is obtained
by selecting the ITER option and KSTEP =MAXITER.
5.For AUTO and SEMI options, the stiffness matrix is updated on convergence if KSTEP is less than
the number of iterations that were required for convergence with the current stiffness.
6.The number of iterations for a load increment is limited to MAXITER.  If the solution does not
converge in MAXITER iterations, the load increment is bisected and the analysis is repeated.  If the
load increment cannot be bisected (i.e., MAXBIS is attained or MAXBIS =0) and MAXDIV is
positive, the best attainable solution is computed and the analysis is  continued to the next load
increment.  If MAXDIV is negative, the analysis is terminated.
7.The test flags (U =displacement error, P =load equilibrium error, and W =work error) and the
tolerances (EPSU, EPSP, and EPSW) define the convergence criteria.  All the requested criteria
(combination of U, P, and/or W) are satisfied upon convergence.  See the MSC Nastran Handbook
for Nonlinear Analysis for more details on convergence criteria.
8.INTOUT controls the output requests for displacements, element forces and stresses, etc.  YES or
ALL must be specified in order to be able to perform a subsequent restart from the middle of a
subcase.
•For the Newton family of iteration methods (i.e., when no NLPCI command is specified), the
option ALL is equivalent to option YES since the computed load increment is always equal to the
user-specified load increment.
•For arc -length methods (i.e., when the NLPCI command is specified) the computed load
increment in general is not going to be equal to the user -specified load increment, and is  not
known in advance.  The option ALL allows the user to obtain solutions at the desired intermediate
load increments.
9.The ratio of energy errors before and after the iteration is defined as divergence rate , i.e.,
Depending on the divergence rate, the number of diverging iteration (NDIV) is incremented as
follows:INTOUT Output Processed
YES For every computed load increment.
NO For the last load of the subcase.
ALL For every computed and user -specified load increment.

If  or , then NDIV = NDIV + 2
If , then NDIV = NDIV + 1
The solution is assumed to diverge when NDIV &amp;gt;|MAXDIV|.  If the solution diverges and the load
increment cannot be further bisected (i.e., MAXBIS is attained or MAXBIS is zero), the stiffness is
updated based on the previous iteration and the analysis is continued.  If the solution diverges again
in the same load increment while MAXDIV is positive, the best solution is computed and the analysis
is continued to the next load increment.  If MAXDIV is negative, the analysis is terminated on the
second divergence.
10. The BFGS update is  performed if MAXQN &amp;gt;0.  As many as MAXQN quasi -Newton vectors can be
accumulated.  The BFGS update with these QN vectors provides a secant modulus in the search
direction.  If MAXQN is reached, no additional ON vectors will be accumulated.  Accumulated QN
vectors are purged when the stiffness is updated and the accumulation is resumed.
11. The line search is performed as required, if MAXLS &amp;gt;0.  In the line search, the displacement
increment is scaled to minimize the energy error.  The line search is  not performed if the absolute
value of the relative energy error is less than the value specified in LSTOL.
12. The number of subincrements in the material routines (elastoplastic and creep) is determined so that
the subincrement size is approximately  (equivalent stress).  FSTRESS is also used
to establish a tolerance for error correction in the elastoplastic material; i.e.,
error in yield function &amp;lt;
If the limit is exceeded at the converging state, the program will exit with a fatal message.  Otherwise,
the stress state is  adjusted to the current yield surface.
13. The number of bisections for a load increment/arc -length is limited to the absolute value of
MAXBIS.  Different actions are taken when the solution diverges depending on the sign of MAXBIS.&lt;br&gt;
If MAXBIS is positive, the stiffness is updated on the first divergence, and the load is bisected on the
second divergence.  If MAXBIS is negative, the load is bisected every time the solution diverges until
the limit on bisection is reached.  If the solution does not converge after |MAXBIS| bisections, the
analysis is continued or terminated depending on the sign of MAXDIV.  See Remark 9.
14. MAXR is used in the adaptive load increment/arc -length method to define the overall upper and
lower bounds on the load increment/arc -length in the subcase; i.e.,
where  is the arc -length at step n and  is the original arc -length.  The arc -length method for
load increments is selected by an NLPCI Bulk Data entry.  This entry must have the same ID as the
NLPARM Bulk Data entry.Ei1 Ei1012–

15. The bisection is activated if the incremental rotation for any degree-of-freedom
exceeds the value specified by RTOLB.  This bisection strategy is based on the
incremental rotation and controlled by MAXBIS.
16. Default tolerance sets are determined based on model type and desired accuracy. Accuracy is under
user control and can be specified on the PARAM, NLTOL entry. NLTOL’s value is used only if the
CONV, EPSU, EPSP and EPSW fields are blank, and if NINC is set to a value of 10 or larger.

Remarks:
1.For the surfaces of an incomplete enclosure (view factors add up to less than 1.0), a complete
enclosure may be achieved (SUM = 1.0) by specifying an ambient element, ELEAMB.  When
multiple cavities are defined, each cavity must have a unique ambient element if ambient elements
are desired.  No elements can be shared between cavities.
2.Third -body shadowing is ignored in the cavity if SHADOW = “NO”.  In particular, if it is known a
priori that there is no third -body shadowing, SHADOW = NO overrides KSHD and KBSHD fields
on the VIEW Bulk Data entry as well as reduces the calculation time immensely.
3.The view factors for a complete enclosure may add up to slightly more than 1.0 due to calculation

summation equal to the value specified for SCALE.  If SCALE is left blank or set to 0.0, no scaling
is performed.
4.If the VIEW3D Bulk Data entry is not specified, the view factors are calculated using finite difference
and contour integration methods.  If NFECI =“FD”, then all view factors are calculated using the
finite difference technique.  NFECI = “CONT” invokes contour integration for all view factor
calculations.  If NFECI is blank, the program selects a method to use between any two particular
elements based on RMAX.
5.The comparison value for RMAX is equal to  where  is the area of a subelement and&lt;br&gt;
is the distance between two subelements r and s for which view factors are being computed.  When
NFECI is blank, the program selects the contour integral method only if .
6.When a number of elements are grouped together and considered as a conglomerate surface, view
factors can be calculated between these groups.  These are referred to as global view factors.  The
SET1 Bulk Data entry is used to define the conglomerate.  When using this feature, negative EIDs
are not allowed.
7.If a RADLST and RADMTX entry exists for this cavity ID, new view factors are not computed and
the existing RADLST and RADMTX are used in the thermal analysis.
8.The VIEW3D Bulk Data entry must be specified for the calculation of axisymmetric view factors.
The process relies on the internal construction of a semi-circle of computational elements. NREV
specifies the number of such elements desired.Asdrs2 Asdrs

Remarks:
1.A radiation EIDi list isolates those CHBDYi surface element faces that are to communicate in a
radiation enclosure.  View -factor calculation and RADMTX formation for an enclosure is performed
only for (or among) those faces identified within the same RADCAV.
2.A radiation exchange matrix (RADMTX) can only reference one radiative face list (RADLST).  The
companion RADCAV, RADLST, and RADMTX must share a unique ICAVITY.
3.For each EIDi, the appropriate CHBDYi element is located, and the proper RADM entry ID field
found.
4.If the radiation exchange matrix or any radiation boundary conditions are available from an external

3.TYPE (field 5) also determines the manner in which EXCITEID (field 3) is used by the program as
described below
Excitation specified by TYPE is applied load
•There is no LOADSET request in Case Control
EXCITEID may also reference DAREA, static, and thermal load set entries
•There is a LOADSET request in Case Control
The program may also reference static and thermal load set entries specified by the LID or TID
field in the selected LSEQ entries corresponding to the EXCITEID.
Excitation specified by TYPE is enforced motion
•There is no LOADSET request in Case Control
EXCITEID will reference SPCD entries. If such entries indicate null enforced motion, the
program will then assume that the excitation is enforced motion using large mass and will
reference DAREA and static and thermal load set entries just as in the case of applied load
excitation.
•There is a LOADSET request in Case Control
The program will reference SPCD entries specified by the LID field in the selected LSEQ entries
corresponding to the EXCITEID. If such entries indicate null enforced motion, the program will
then assume that the excitation is enforced motion using large mass and will reference static and
thermal load set entries corresponding to the DAREA entry in the selected LSEQ entries, just as
in the case of applied load excitation.
4.EXCITEID may reference sets containing QHBDY, QBDYi, QVECT, QVOL and TEMPBC
entries when using the heat transfer option.
5.TLOAD1 loads may be combined with TLOAD2 loads only by specification on a DLOAD entry.&lt;br&gt;
That is, the SID on a TLOAD1 entry may not be the same as that on a TLOAD2 entry.
6.SID must be unique for all TLOAD1, TLOAD2, RLOAD1, RLOAD2, and ACSRCE entries.
7.If the heat transfer option is used, the referenced QVECT entry may also contain references to
functions of time, and therefore A may be a function of time.
8.If TLOADi entries are selected in SOL 111 or 146 then a Fourier analysis is used to transform the
time-dependent loads on the TLOADi entries to the frequency domain and then combine them with

Remarks:
1.Dynamic excitation sets must be selected with the Case Control command with DLOAD=SID.
2.The type of the dynamic excitation is specified by TYPE (field 5) according to the following table:
3.TYPE (field 5) also determines the manner in which EXCITEID (field 3) is used by the program as
described below
Excitation specified by TYPE is applied load
•There is no LOADSET request in Case Control
EXCITEID may also reference DAREA, static and thermal load set entries
•There is a LOADSET request in Case Control
The program may also reference static and thermal load set entries specified by the LID or TID
field in the selected LSEQ entries corresponding to the EXCITEID.

reference DAREA and static and thermal load set entries just as in the case of applied load
excitation.

Remarks:
1.The TSTEPNL Bulk Data entry is selected by the Case Control command TSTEP = ID.  Each
residual structure subcase requires a TSTEP entry and either applied loads via TLOADi data or initial
values from a previous subcase.  Multiple subcases are assumed to occur sequentially in time with the
initial values of time and displacement conditions of each subcase defined by the end conditions of
the previous subcase.
2.NDT is used to define the total duration for analysis, which is NDT * DT. Since DT is adjusted
during the analysis , the actual number of time steps, in general, will not be equal to NDT).  Also,
DT is used only as an initial value for the time increment.
3.For printing and plotting the solution, data recovery is performed at time steps 0, NO, 2 * NO, &amp;hellip;,
and the last converged step.  The Case Control command OTIME may also be used to control the
output times.
4.The number of iterations for a time step is limited to MAXITER.  If MAXITER is negative, the
analysis is terminated when the divergence condition is encountered twice during the same time step
or the solution diverges for five consecutive time steps.  If MAXITER is positive, the program
computes the best solution and continues the analysis until divergence occurs again.  If the solution
does not converge in MAXITER iterations, the process is treated as a divergent process.  See Remark
6.
5.The convergence test flags (U = displacement error test, P = load equilibrium error test, W = work
error test) and the error tolerances (EPSU, EPSP, and EPSW) define the convergence criteria.  All
requested criteria (combination of U, P, and/or W) are satisfied upon convergence.  Note that at least
two iterations are necessary to check the displacement convergence criterion.FSTRESSFraction of effective stress  used to limit the subincrement size in the material routines.&lt;br&gt;

6.MAXDIV provides control over diverging solutions.  Depending on the rate of divergence, the
number of diverging solutions (NDIV) is incremented by 1 or 2.  The solution is assumed to diverge
when NDIV reaches MAXDIV during the iteration.  If the bisection option is used (allowed
MAXBIS times) the time step is bisected upon divergence.  Otherwise, the solution for the time step
is repeated with a new stiffness based on the converged state at the beginning of the time step.  If
NDIV reaches MAXDIV again within the same time step, the analysis is terminated.
7.Nonzero values of MAXQN and MAXLS will activate the quasi -Newton update and the line search
process, respectively.
8.The number of subincrements in the material routines is determined such that the subincrement size
is approximately FSTRESS .  FSTRESS is also used to establish a tolerance for error correction
in elastoplastic material, i.e.,
error in yield function &amp;lt;FSTRESS  yield stress
If the limit is exceeded at the converging state, the program will terminate with a fatal error message.&lt;br&gt;
Otherwise, the stress state is adjusted to the current yield surface, resulting in = 0.
9.The bisection process is activated when divergence occurs and MAXBIS 0.  The number of
bisections for a time increment is limited to |MAXBIS|.  If MAXBIS is positive and the solution does
not converge after MAXBIS bisections, the best solution is computed and the analysis is continued to
the next time step.  If MAXBIS is negative and the solution does not converge in |MAXBIS| bisection,
the analysis is terminated.
10. ADJUST controls the automatic time stepping.  Since the automatic time step adjustment is based
on the mode of response and not on the loading pattern, it may be necessary to limit the adjustable
step size when the period of the forcing function is much shorter than the period of dominant
response frequency of the structure.  It is the user’s responsibility to ensure that the loading history is
properly traced with the ADJUST option.  The ADJUST option should be suppressed for the
duration of short pulse loading.  If unsure, start with a value for DT that is much smaller than the
pulse duration in order to properly represent the loading pattern.
•If ADJUST = 0, then the automatic adjustment is deactivated.  This is recommended when the
loading consists of short duration pulses.
•If ADJUST &amp;gt; 0, the time increment is continually adjusted for the first few steps until a good value
of t is obtained.  After this initial adjustment, the time increment is adjusted every ADJUST -th
time step only.
•If ADJUST is one order greater than NDT, then automatic adjustment is deactivated after the
initial adjustment.
11. MSTEP and RB are used to adjust the time increment during analysis.  The recommended value of
MSTEP for nearly linear problems is 20.  A larger value (e.g., 40) is required for highly nonlinear
problems.  By default, the program automatically computes the value of MSTEP based on the
changes in the stiffness.
The time increment adjustment is based on the number of time steps desired to capture the dominant
frequency response accurately.  The time increment is adjusted as follows:

Calculation of View Factors
MSC Nastran has two independent routines available for the calculation of view factors between gray diffuse
surface elements.  The default routine, the VIEW  module, relies on a user defined combination of area and
contour discretization to determine the geometric view factor.  The second module, VIEW3D , utilizes
Gaussian integration  and semi -analytic contour integration to evaluate view factors.  In the material that
follows, the two methods are compared and contrasted from a user standpoint in an effort to direct their most
efficient application.
Fundamentals of View Factor Calculation
1.View factors can only be determined between surfaces that have been identified with CHBDYi surface
elements.
2.Because of the geometric or visual nature of the view factor calculation, it is often necessary to identify
both sides of conduction elements with independent surface elements, particularly when third -body
shadowing is of concern.  Only active surface elements can participate, or be seen, in a view factor
calculation.
3.The active side of the surface element is defined relative to the grid point connections.  The right hand
rule specifies the outward surface normal as one proceeds from G1 to Gn thereby defining the active
surface element.
4.The overall quality of the view factor calculated is highly dependent on the surface element mesh
model.  When the distance between any two elements is reduced below a level on the order of an
element length or width, inaccuracies can develop. At the same time, a large number of small elements
can create a very computationally intensive problem.
5.There are two types of shadowing which can also reduce the quality of the overall view factor.&lt;br&gt;
Self-shadowing  reduces the total view factor between two surfaces due simply to their relative
orientations in space ( Figure 0-1).  Third -body shadowing ( Figure 0-2) takes into account the reduced
view between two surfaces due to other interelement interference surfaces. In this figure, note the
existence of both the K and L surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

All surface elements may be used for radiation enclosure analysis if the appropriate user supplied view
or exchange factors are available.
7.MSC Nastran allows for isolated surface element groupings when performing view factor calculations
– multiple radiation cavities .  This procedure can eliminate a great deal of needless calculation among
surfaces when one group of elements clearly cannot see another group of elements.  The surface
element groups therefore are arranged by unique cavity IDs. No surface element may reside in more
than on cavity.
8.The VIEW  entry invokes the calculation of the view factors for the overall thermal analysis.  It also
separates the CHBDYi surface elements into the desired cavities.  The IVIEW field identifies the
CHBDYi elements and the ICAVITY field assigns the elements to a cavity.

2.The VIEW  Module solves (0-1) by two methods.  The first method discretizes the surface elements
into a number of finite subelements and treats the integrals as dual summations over all the
subelements on surfaces I and J.  This method is often referred to as the finite difference method, but
is just an extension of view factor algebra. Consider the surfaces I and II below with subdivision

The second method transforms the area integrals into contour integrals and subdivides the perimeter

answer.  Several choices can be made by the user as a result.  The RADCAV entry has information

NFECI = blank or 0.  This is the default value signifying that the code will make an estimate based
on geometry and the field value of RMAX as to whether it will use finite differences or contour
integration. Figure 0-4 below illustrates the criteria enforced.

Contour integration is used on any element pair for which;
For example, if ,  enforces contour integration.
1.Since the VIEW  Module relies on element subdivision in its calculation method, a means of
requesting the level of subdivision is made available.  The number of element subdivisions are
specified on the NB and NG field of the VIEW entry.  The subdivision process is illustrated below
for the various surface element types.
Using the VIEW3D  Module - 3D Geometries
1.The VIEW3D Module relies on Gaussian integration techniques for the solution of (0-1).  This view
module is accessed by introducing the VIEW3D Bulk Data entry.  This view factor calculator is
semi-adaptive in that detection of excessive error or shadowing, will automatically invoke
semi-analytic contour integration techniques or higher Gaussian integration order to reduce the
error.  For a general 3D geometry, this procedure is superior in both accuracy and speed to that
available with the VIEW module.
2.The VIEW3D Module is designed for the calculation of view factors for general 3D and
axisymmetric geometries.  Planar view factors must be calculated with the VIEW routine.
3.There is no surface subdivision available with VIEW3D, therefore a responsible initial mesh is
required for good results.  Accuracy levels can be substantially controlled by requesting the use of
various integration orders.i jdij

4.This module is requested by including the Bulk Data entry VIEW3D.  The VIEW3D entry contains
specific fields for defining the various integration orders desired for unobstructed view factors, self and
third -body shadowing view factors, and improved view factors when excessive error is detected.
5.The view factor error is defined as:
In this equation,  is the initially calculated view factor (always an integration order of 2 by 2) and
RMAX and RMIN represent the largest and smallest integration point (surface I) to integration point
(surface J) vector lengths.  Surface proximity and orientation are reflected in this value.
6.When a large number of surfaces are involved in an enclosure (1000+), it may be advisable to reduce
the values of the field data for GITB, GIPS, and CIER to the value of (2).
7.Because view factors solely involve geometry, it is important to work in dimensions/units  that do not
lead to machine accuracy problems.  In particular, in transformed space, the view factor equation has
an integration point to integration point distance raised to the fourth power in the denominator.
Using the VIEW3D Module - Axisymmetric Geometries
1.Axisymmetric geometries have their radiative surfaces modeled with CHBDYG elements of
TYPE=REV. These are necessarily attached to CTRIAX6 conduction elements.NB = 3

2.The module is designed to build an internal geometry composed of a 3D representation of the
axisymmetric model. This computational model represents approximately one-half of a full 3D
geometry. The number of elements employed in the computational models is set by the user through
the value NREV in field 9 of the RADCAB Bulk Data entry. Every REV element in a given cavity
then must generate the same number of computation elements. It is recommended to set NREV to a
level which will result in approximately square computation elements being created. To guarantee this
for every element then, all REV elements would need to be about the same length. This may not be
practical for many problems.
3.Although there are considerable numbers of computational elements, the liberal use of symmetry
eliminates the need to calculate many of the individual view factors in the internal half-model
representation. In the absence of any third body shadowing, the axisymmetric calculation should be
much faster than the equivalent 3D calculation.
4.The general specification of shadowing conditions for axisymmetric geometry can be complicated.
For simple geometries, the user can save considerable calculation effort by setting the NONE, KSHD,
and KBSHD flags on the shade field of the VIEW Bulk Data entry. When in doubt, it is safest to use
the designation BOTH.
Miscellaneous View Factor  Capabilities (VIEW  or VIEW3D)
1.Shadowing calculations absorb considerable resources while calculating view factors.  If the geometry
is such that no shadowing can occur, it is recommended to turn off the calculation process by utilizing
the SHADOW field on the RADCAV entry.  A NO declaration will eliminate any shadowing
calculations.  The default value is YES.  If a limited subset of surfaces in a problem are involved in
shadowing, the most efficient calculation will result if the SHADE field of the VIEW  Bulk Data entry
is appropriately identified.
2.If a complete radiation enclosure is being analyzed, small inaccuracies in the individual view factors
may lead to view factor sums that exceed 1.0 by a small (1 or 2 percent) amount.  In this case, the
view factors can be scaled to provide a sum of exactly 1.0 by utilizing the SCALE field on the
RADCAV entry.
3.If an incomplete enclosure is being analyzed and it is desirable to complete the enclosure with a
dummy or space element, this can be facilitated by using the ELEAMB field of the RADCAV entry.&lt;br&gt;
The ambient element must be an existing surface element of the problem, however, it is not used
explicitly in the determination of the view factors.  Subsequent to the view factor calculations, the
view factor 1.0 – SUMMATION is assigned to the space element for each individual enclosure
surface element.
4.View factor output can be controlled through the PRTPCH field of the RADCAV entry.
5.We define a global view factor as the view factor that exists between one group of surface elements
and another group of surface elements.  If global view factors are of interest, perhaps for some system
level analysis, these can be determined while executing the VIEW module.  The  fields on the
RADCAV entry reference the desired surface element sets.SETij&lt;/p&gt;

Radiation Matrix  Formation Using MSC Nastran View Factors
As described in View Factor Calculation Methods , 481, MSC Nastran can calculate diffuse grey geometric view
factors (stored as ) to be used in radiation enclosure analysis.  Those view factors are used in (0-41) to
generate a total radiation exchange matrix.  This matrix is symmetric and generally non -conservative in the
sense that the column summations will not be equal to zero.  This would imply that in an isothermal
enclosure, there would exist net heat flow.  This could be the result of an incomplete enclosure with resultant
energy loss to space.  If a complete enclosure is desired, an ambient element can be requested.  The total view
factor summations can also be scaled to exactly equal 1.0 for any summations exceeding 1.0.  These options
are discussed beginning on View Factor Calculation Methods , 481.
Control over the form of the radiation matrix can be effected by specifying the matrix type (MTXTYP) on
the RADLST Bulk Data entry.  Once these entries are generated by the VIEW  or VIEW3D  module, the
matrix type can either remain as MTXTYP = 1, or it can be changed to a MTXTYP = 4.  In this case, the
radiation matrix will have its diagonal terms adjusted to provide a column sum of exactly zero.  This is
referred to as a conservative radiation matrix.
Radiation Matrix Formation Using User -Supplied Exchange Factors
It may be desirable to input the radiation exchange matrix directly.  In this case the user provides exchange
factors with the RADLST/RADMTX  Bulk Data entries.  Exchange factors can be used to account for
specular effects, transmissive surface character, and enclosure gas absorption.  When used in this fashion, the
input represents the following system:=Supplied on the PARAM,SIGMA  Bulk Data entry

Real Surface Approximation and Radiation Exchange
In the most general sense, radiative surface properties can vary with absorption and emission angle, surface
temperature, and spectral distribution of incident and emitted radiation. For an enclosure analysis, the many
reflections and re -reflections tend to smooth out directional behavior. Additionally, it may be difficult if not
impossible to acquire good directional, temperature, or wavelength dependent surface properties.  Based on
this, many radiation problems are approximated at the first level of analysis with surfaces which exhibit
diffuse gray absorption and emission radiative character.
MSC Nastran allows for a second level of analysis which presumes that radiation surface interaction is diffuse,
but admits emissivity and absorptivity to be functions of temperature and/or wavelength. The concept of a
diffuse view factor is still applicable for this type of analysis since it is a simple geometric construct. The basic
notion involved here is to consider the energy transport associated with separate wavelength intervals
(wavebands ). Numerically, this can be implemented with a method known as the band -energy
approximation .
Figure 0-1 illustrates the hemispherical spectral emissivity for tungsten. Figure 0-2 depicts a potential waveband&lt;br&gt;

1.Only one RADBND  (wavelength break point) entry can be specified with any input file.  This does
not mean that all surfaces of all cavities must display spectral surface behavior.  For any surfaces which
are to remain as grey or blackbody, each waveband  emissivity value associated with its RADM entry
can be given the same emissivity value resulting in a constant emissivity over all wavelengths.  Recall
that radiation material surface properties are associated with the CHBDYi surface element
description, so every element in every cavity can potentially exhibit its own radiative character.
2.Temperature and/or wavelength dependent radiative surface properties can be applied to radiation
enclosure analyses as well as the radiation boundary condition.
3.Within each waveband the emissivity must be a constant value.  Each discontinuity (vertical jump)
in the emissivity vs. wavelength piecewise linear curve must be input as a waveband of zero width.
4.The necessary inputs for spectral exchange in MSC Nastran are given in Thermal Capabilities , 9.

3.Calculation process - Radiant enclosure exchange where the view factors  must be calculated
a.All conduction element surfaces involved in a radiation enclosure must be identified with
surface elements (CHBDYi ). The CHBDYi description of the surface element identifies the
surface material entry (RADM ) as well as the cavity identification (VIEW ). Multiple
cavities may be defined within MSC Nastran for flexible modeling, user convenience, and
eliminating shadowing calculations in determining view factors when groups of elements
see only themselves to the exclusion of other groups of elements.
b.Since no RADLST/RADMTX  exists for this problem, they will be calculated. The
calculation of view factors is instigated by including the VIEW  Bulk Data entry which is
referenced from the CHBDYi  entries. VIEW  lumps together those surface elements of a
common cavity identification and provides some guidance regarding how the elements
interact relative to any required shadowing calculations.
c.Only one RADCAV  Bulk Data entry exists for each cavity. This entry has an array of
information available on it that is used to control the global aspects of the view factor
calculation for the cavity in question.
d.If the finite difference view factor  module (default which may be described as an area
subdivision method) is to be used for the view factor calculation, the entries discussed thus
far are adequate for this part of the calculation. The minimum subset of Bulk Data entries
for this method of view factor calculation is:

RADBND Provides Planck’s second constant  and the wavelength break points  used for spectral radiation exchange&lt;br&gt;
analysis. There can only be one RADBND statement in a given analysis, regardless of the number of
cavitities. While this forces every exchange surface to have identical waveband break points, there may be
different RADM/RADMT for potentially every surface.&lt;/p&gt;

Temperature Boundary Conditions and Constraints
A temperature boundary condition can be useful in defining independent GRID point or SPOINT
temperature in an analysis. This applies to grid points associated with conduction elements, surface elements,
ambient points, control nodes, or film nodes as well as to scalar points. The methods available for specifying
these temperatures are discussed below. Temperature boundary conditions are treated like loads because they
are selected from the Case Control Section.RADM RADMID ABSORP EMIS1 EMIS2 EMIS3 EMIS4 EMIS5 EMIS6

Available Temperature Boundary Conditions and Constraints
Key Points - Temperature Boundary Conditions
Key points for temperature boundary conditions are:
No Bulk Data file may utilize more than one method for temperature specification. For example, an
SPC entry and a TEMPBC entry of the type =STAT cannot exist in the same file.
Whenever a TEMPBC entry of type =TRAN temperature boundary condition is specified in an
analysis, the CONV field of the solution control entry (TSTEPNL) must be a U specification.
Temperature initialization (see Initial Conditions ) should always be set for all TEMPBC entries of
type =TRAN temperature boundary conditions. Additionally, all temperature initial conditions
must agree with the specified boundary conditions. For the MPC relationship then the initial
temperature specifications must satisfy the given identity.
In SOL 153, singularities in the stiffness matrix can be constrained automatically by Bulk Data
entry PARAM,AUTOSPC,YES. However, AUTOSPC does not provide the correct action for the
nonlinear stiffness matrix in SOL 159.SPC The single-point constraint is selected in the Case Control Section with SPC =SID. For heat transfer, an
SPC may be used to define a temperature for steady state analysis or transient analysis if the boundary
condition over all time is to remain at a constant value. This is the recommended approach to fixed
temperature specification for both steady state and transient analysis. In the constant value case, these degrees
of freedom are eliminated from the analysis set and therefore cannot influence the iterative convergence
criteria. In steady state analysis, SPCs are subcase selectable. In transient analysis, SPCs must be selected
above the subcase level. When used with SPCD, SPC1 can also be used to specify nonzero temperature
boundary conditions.
TEMPBC This form of boundary temperature specification is more flexible than the SPC definition since it can be used
to define a temperature that varies with time throughout a transient analysis. The basic procedure for
transient specification when the value varies with time is to use the dynamic load process as discussed in the
load section (see  Thermal Loads , 14). The SID on the TEMPBC is referenced by a TLOADi Bulk Data entry
(DAREA field). The TLOADi entry must be selected using the Case Control command (DLOAD = SID).
Field 3 for TYPE is specified either as STAT or TRAN as desired. For steady state (STAT type) analysis, the
Case Control command is SPC = SID where the SID is field 2 of the TEMPBC entry.
For transient (type =TRAN) analysis, this boundary specification cannot eliminate the degrees of freedom
from the analysis set. Rather, it internally implements a penalty method for maintaining the desired
temperature value. The fixed matrix conductance term has a set value of 1.0E+10. In some instances, this
magnitude may overwhelm the convergence criteria. In these cases, there is another approach to specified
temperatures that can circumvent the problem (see the following discussion of CELASi).
CELASi These 1-D elements provide a convenient resistive network element that can be used for thermal system
modeling as well as for driving temperature boundary conditions. They may automatically have one end set
to a zero or grounded value. A heat load (QHBDY) applied at the free end can be constant or time varying.
The load and matrix conductance values can be adjusted to minimize the influence over the iterative
convergence criteria.
MPC Otherwise known as a multipoint constraint. This constraint can be used to specify a grid point temperature
to be a weighted combination of any number of other grid point temperatures. An MPC is requested in the
Case Control Section with the MPC = SID command. For transient analysis, an MPC must be requested
above the subcase level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Thermal Analysis User’s Guide
Initial Conditions36
Main Index
Initial Conditions
Setting initial temperatures is required in several situations. In steady state analysis, temperatures are usually
required as a starting point for the nonlinear iteration process. In transient analysis, initial temperature
specifications define the state from which the solution evolves.
Steady State Analysis
Since most heat transfer problems are nonlinear due to material properties, variable boundary conditions, or
radiation exchange, iteration is employed in the solution of the system equations. An initial temperature guess
is required to initialize any temperature&amp;ndash;dependent properties or boundary conditions. A good initial
estimate can be helpful in achieving a converged solution.
Transient Analysis
T ransient analysis, whether linear or nonlinear, employs a starting temperature as the initial condition from
which the solution evolves. These starting temperatures are not, in general, arbitrary temperatures. Any
noninitialized temperatures are presumed to have a value of zero.Case Control  Required: TEMP(INIT)  = SID
Bulk Data  Entries: TEMP  - Defines starting temperature on specific grid points.
TEMPD  - Automatically defines starting temperature on any remaining grid points not
specified with a TEMP entry.
Case Control  Required: IC = SID.
Bulk Data  Entries: TEMP  - Defines initial temperature on specific grid points.
TEMPD  - Automatically defines initial temperature on any grid points not set with a TEMP
Bulk Data entry.&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction to Interface and File Communication
The formalities associated with MSC Nastran inputs and outputs are developed in this chapter. The input is
described in terms of an input data file that may be generated by hand or by a suitable preprocessor. Among
the five separate sections involved in the general input is a complete description of the model, including:
The type of analysis being performed.
The problem geometry as modeled.
The conduction elements that approximate the structure.
The surface elements that allow the structure to communicate with the boundary conditions.
The boundary conditions associated with convection and radiation.
The loads associated with applied fluxes for all load conditions of interest.
The specification of the known temperatures in the analysis.
Requests for the desired output quantities along with their format and form.
Execution of MSC Nastran
The MSC Nastran input file  is a text file that is given a filename and a .dat extension (e.g., EXAMPLE1.dat).
To execute MSC Nastran, the user types a system command followed by the name of the input file. The .dat
extension is automatically assumed by MSC Nastran if there is no file extension associated with the specified
filename. A typical execution is
Input Data
MSC Nastran input requires records that are 80 characters (or columns) in length. The input file is comprised
of five sections that must be assembled in the following sequence:NASTRAN EXAMPLE1

The records of the first four sections are input in free-field format, and only columns 1 through 72 are used
for data. Any information in columns 73 through 80 may appear in the printed echo, but is not used by the
program. If the last character in a record is a comma, then the record is continued to the next record.
The Bulk Data entries have special free-field rules, but may be specified as fixed field. Both options are
described in the MSC Nastran Reference Guide . The Bulk Data entries may also make limited use of columns 73
through 80 for the purpose of continuation.
NASTRAN Definition(s)  (Optional Statement)
The NASTRAN definition statement is optional and is used in special circumstances (see the Executing MSC
Nastran  (p.1) in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide  ).
File Management Statements  (Optional Section)
The File Management Section is optional and follows the NASTRAN definition(s). It ends with the
specification of an Executive Control statement. This section provides for database initialization and
management along with job identification and restart conditions. The File Management statements are

Executive Control Statements  (Required)
The Executive Control Section begins with the first Executive Control statement and ends with the CEND
delimiter. It identifies the job and the type of solution to be performed. It also declares the general conditions
under which the job is to be executed, such as maximum time allowed and the type of system diagnostics
desired. If the job is to be executed with a solution sequence, the actual solution sequence is declared along
with any alterations to the solution sequence that may be desired. If Direct Matrix Abstraction is used, the
complete DMAP sequence must appear in the Executive Control Section. The Executive Control statements
and examples of their use are described in the File Management Statements  (p.45) in the MSC Nastran Quick
Reference Guide .
Case Control Commands  (Required)
The Case Control Section follows CEND  and ends with the BEGIN BULK  delimiter. It defines the subcase
structure for the problem, defines sets of Bulk Data, and makes output requests for printing, punching, and
plotting. A general discussion of the functions of the Case Control Section and a detailed description of the
commands used in this section are given in the Case Control Commands  (p.175) in the MSC Nastran Quick
Reference Guide  . Those commands used most commonly in thermal analysis are complied in Thermal Analysis
Case Control Commands, 312 . Also, the Case Control highlights for heat transfer are given here.
Steady State Heat Transfer  - SOL 153
A separate subcase must be defined for each unique combination of thermal loads (LOAD Case
Control command), temperature constraints (SPC and MPC command), and nonlinear iteration
strategy (NLPARM command).
The LOAD  Case Control command references the static thermal load entries: QVOL , QVECT ,
QHBDY , and QBDYi . Each subcase defines a set of loads that can then be subdivided into a
number of increments for the nonlinear solution process (NLPARM  Bulk Data entry).
The load step is labeled by the cumulative load factor. The load factor varies from 0 to 1 in each
subcase. Specifically, the load step ends with 1, 2, 3, etc. for the first, the second, and the third
subcase, respectively. The data blocks containing solutions can be generated at each increment or at
the end of each subcase, depending on the intermediate output option specified on the INTOUT
field of the NLPARM  Bulk Data entry. Data blocks are stored in the database for the output process
and restarts.
The SPC  Case Control command references the temperature boundary conditions in the SPC Bulk
Data entry. The applied temperature boundary condition is also subdivided in the subcase in an
incremental fashion.
The MPC  Case Control command references the algebraic temperature constraints in the MPC
Bulk Data entry. In heat transfer we can think of MPCs as perfect conductor networks.
The TEMP(INIT)  Case Control command references the initial temperatures that are required for
all nonlinear analyses. An initialized temperature distribution must be defined using TEMP and/or
TEMPD Bulk Data entries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;41 CHAPTER 3
Interface and File Communication
Main Index
Output requests  for each subcase are processed independently. Requested output quantities for all
the subcases are appended after the computational process for actual output operation. Available
outputs are as follows:
MSC Nastran data may be output in either SORT1  or SORT2  formats. SORT1 output provides a
tabular listing of all grid points or elements for each loading condition. SORT2 output is tabular
listings of loading conditions for each grid point or element. SORT1 output is the steady state
default format. SORT2 is generated by requesting XYPLOTS. See Case Control Commands for Output  in
the MSC Nastran Reference Guide for a discussion of SORT1 and SORT2 formats and their
defaults.
Restarts are controlled by the PARAMeters SUBID  and LOOPID . The Case Control command
THERMAL(PUNCH) can be used to generate temperature punch files suitable for restart initial
conditions or thermal stress analysis loads.
Transient Heat Transfer  - SOL 159
Only one set of temperature constraints (via the MPC  and SPC  Case Control command) may be
requested and must be specified above the subcase level. Any DMIG  and/or TF  used must also be
selected above the subcase level.
A subcase must be defined for each unique combination of transient thermal load conditions
(DLOAD  command) and nonlinear iteration strategy (TSTEPNL  command).
Each subcase defines a time interval starting from the last time step of the previous subcase, and the
time interval requested is subdivided into the appropriate time steps. The data blocks containing
solutions are generated at the end of each subcase to store in the database for output process and
restarts.
The DLOAD and/or NONLINEAR  command must be used to specify time-dependent loading
conditions. The static thermal load entries QVOL, QVECT, QHBDY, and QBDYi may be used in
defining a dynamic load as specified by the TLOADi entry. The set identification number (SID) on
the static load entries is specified in the DAREA field of the TLOADi entry. The TEMPBC (of
TRAN type)  Bulk Data entry may be requested in the same fashion.
The input loading functions may be changed for each subcase or continued by repeating the same
DLOAD request. However, it is recommended to use the same TLOADi Bulk Data entry for all
subcases in order to maintain continuity, since the TLOADi entry defines the loading history as a
function of cumulative time.
Temperature initial conditions are requested above the subcase level with the IC  Case Control
command. Initial temperatures are specified on TEMP  and/or TEMPD  Bulk Data entries.THERMAL Temperatures for GRID points and SPOINTs.
FLUX Inner element temperature gradients. Heat flows for CHBDYi elements.

Output requests  for each subcase are processed independently. Requested output quantities for all
the subcases are appended after the computational process for the actual output operation. The
available output is as follows:
MSC Nastran data may be output in either SORT1  or SORT2  output format. SORT1 output is a
tabular listing of all grid points or elements for each time step in transient analysis. In transient
analysis, SORT1 output is requested by placing a PARAM,CURVPLOT,+1 in the Bulk Data. See&lt;br&gt;
Chapter 3: Interface and File Communication Case Control Commands for Output  for a discussion of SORT1 and
SORT2 formats and their defaults.
SORT2 is the default format for transient analysis.
Restarts are controlled by the parameters STIME , LOOPID, and SLOOPID . See the MSC Nastran
Handbook for Nonlinear Analysis , Section 9.2.2  for a discussion of restarts for nonlinear transient
analysis. The Case Control command THERMAL(PUNCH) can be used to generate temperature
punch files suitable for restart initial conditions or for thermal stress analysis loads.
Bulk Data Entries  (Required)
The Bulk Data Section follows BEGIN BULK  and ends with the ENDDATA delimiter. It contains all of the
details of the model and the conditions for the solution. BEGIN BULK and ENDDATA must be present
even though no new Bulk Data is being introduced into the problem or if all of the Bulk Data is coming from
an alternate source, such as user-generated input. The format of the BEGIN BULK entry is in free-field
format. The ENDDATA  delimiter must begin in column 1 or column 2. In general, only one model can be
defined in the Bulk Data Section. However, some of the Bulk Data, such as the entries associated with loading
conditions, direct input matrices, and transfer functions, may exist in multiple sets. Only sets selected in the
Case Control Section are used in any particular solution. The Bulk Data entries associated primarily with
thermal analysis are included in Commonly Used Bulk Data Entries  (App. D).
Miscellaneous Input
The input file might also include required resident operating system job control language (JCL) statements.&lt;br&gt;
The type and number of JCL  statements varies with the particular computer installation.
The input file may be formed by the insertion of other files with the INCLUDE statement. This INCLUDE
statement may be specified in any of the five parts of the input file.
Comments  may be inserted in any of the parts of the input file. They are identified by a dollar sign ($ ) in
column 1. Columns 2 through 72 may contain any desired text.ENTHALPY Grid point enthalpies.

Files Generated by MSC Nastran
Upon successful execution of an MSC Nastran job, a variety of files are automatically created. These files
have the following filename extensions and descriptions as shown below:
SCR  (scratch) Command .  If no restarts or database manipulations are planned, then the
MASTER, DBALL, USRSOU, and USROBJ files can be automatically deleted (scratched) upon
completion of the run by adding the statement SCR = YES to the execution command. For example,
Failure to delete these files may prohibit subsequent reruns of the same input file.
The .dat, .f06, .f04, .log, and .pch files are ASCII files and can be viewed using any text editor. The remaining
files are binary, and as such, cannot be viewed. The binary files are not intended to be used directly; they are
used for additional analysis, such as restarts or postprocessing. If no restarts are planned, you may specify “scr
= yes” when submitting the input file for execution. The .DBALL, .MASTER, .USROBJ, and .USRSOU
files are placed on the scratch directory and are automatically deleted upon completion of the run.
The .USEROBJ and .USRSOU files are intended only for DMAP users and may be deleted after the run is
complete. The .plt file is a binary file that contains the plotting information generated by NASPLT , the MSC
Nastran internal plotting feature. If NASPLT  is not used, the .plt  file is deleted following the completion of .dat The input file describing the model, the type of solution, the output requests, etc.
Generated with a text editor or preprocessor.
.f06 The main output file containing the printed output such as temperature, temperature
gradients, heat flows, etc.
.f04 A history of the assigned files, disk space usage, and modules used during the analysis.
Useful for debugging.
.log A summary of the command lines options used and the execution links.
.DBALL A database containing the input files, assembled matrices, and solutions. Used for
restarting the job for additional analysis.
.MASTER The file containing the master directory of the files used by the run and the physical
location of the files on the system. This file is also needed for a restart job.
.USRSOU Used only for advanced DMAP applications. This file may be deleted after the run is
finished. It is not needed for restarts.
.USROBJ Used only for advanced DMAP applications. This file may be deleted after the run is
finished. It is not needed for restarts.

the run. If punch output is specified, the .pch  file is retained when the run is complete. The .xdb binary file
is the graphic database used by MSC XL , MSC Aries , and other graphics pre- and postprocessors. It is
requested using PARAM,POST  in the Bulk Data Section. (Refer to the description of PARAM,POST  in
Parameters  (p.805) in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide .)
Plotting
MSC Nastran has the ability to generate structural plots or X-Y plots rom batch program executions. Such
plots are requested by placing data commands at the end of the Case Control Section. Plot requests are
separated from the Case Control by the OUTPUT(PLOT), OUTPUT(XYPLOT), or OUTPUT(XYOUT)
commands. Data above this command is not recognized by the plotter.
For virtually any type of plotter hardware, the plotter programs are executed by
for a “CALCOMP-like” plot, or by
for a “TEKTRONIX-like” plot. The ‘name.plt’ is the filename of the plot file generated from MSC Nastran.
These programs are delivered with the utility files.
The following discussion is limited to a description of all of the commands required to obtain undeformed
structure, thermal contour, and X-Y plots in thermal analysis.
Structural Plotting
In thermal analysis, structural plotting is applied to display the model geometry (undeformed structure plots)
and the temperature distribution across the model (thermal contour plots). The structural plotting is
requested in the Case Control Section by the plotting commands from an OUTPUT(PLOT) command to
either a BEGIN BULK, OUTPUT(XYPLOT), or OUTPUT(XYOUT) command.
Plot Set Selection .  MSC Nastran plots consist of element images. Grid points are identified by the
intersection of the elements. Note that the surface elements CHBDYE, CONV, CONVM, and RADBC
cannot be plotted. The SET command is required to specify sets of elements for plotting. Examples are as
follows:NASPLT ‘name.plt’
TEKPLT ‘name.plt’
SET 1 = ALL
SET 2 = BAR, QUAD4, EXCEPT 10, 50 THRU 90 BY 20
SET 3 = 1, 5 THRU 10, 100 THRU 105, 210
SET 4 = ALL EXCEPT HBDY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;45 CHAPTER 3
Interface and File Communication
Main Index
In these examples, SET 1 includes all elements, SET 2 includes all CBAR and CQUAD4 elements except
elements 10, 50, 70, and 90, SET 3 includes a subset of elements selected by their ID numbers, and SET 4
includes all elements except CHBDYi surface elements.
Only one set of elements can be selected for a particular plot. T o request an undeformed structural plot, the
following two commands are required:
where i identifies one of the sets described in the SET command and j defines an origin for the plot. If j is
equal to  i, the  program finds the origin automatically and positions the plot in the center of the viewing
window. If some other origin is desired, the ORIGIN command should be used. In particular, the ORIGIN
command should be used if more than ten plot sets are requested.
Parameter Definition Commands
The parameter definition commands are described in the MSC Nastran Reference Guide . A set of commonly used
commands is as follows:
PLOTTER = { NAST }
Selects plotter. The default is NAST .
AXES R, S, T
VIEW 
Defines the orientation of the object in relation to the observer. The observer’s coordinate system is
defined as R, S, T , and the basic coordinate system of the object is defined as X, Y, Z. The angular
relationship between the two systems is defined by the three angles  , , and  as follows:FIND SCALE, ORIGIN j, SET i
PLOT SET i, ORIGIN j
where:
R, S, T =X or MX, Y or MY, Z or MZ (where “M” implies the negative axis)
 =three angles of rotation in degrees (Real)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Thermal Analysis User’s Guide
Plotting46
Main Index
The two coordinate systems are coincident (i.e., X is coincident with R, etc.) for   =  =  = 0. The
sequence in which the rotations are taken was arbitrarily chosen as:  , the rotation about the T-axis;
followed by  , the rotation about the S-axis; followed by  , the rotation about the R-axis. Normally,&lt;br&gt;
 is not used since it does not affect the appearance of the  S-T projection, only its orientation on the
page. The default values of the rotations are   = 34.27,  = 23.17, and   = 0.0, which produce a
plot in which unit vectors on the X-, Y-, and Z-axes have equal lengths.
The default view described above may be altered in two  ways. The structural axes that coincide with
the R-, S-, T-axes may be interchanged by means of the “AXES R, S, T” command, and the view
angles can be rotated by the “VIEW  ” command. The default forms of these commands are

that points the X-axis toward the left (in this expression MX means that the minus X-axis coincides
with S) and points the Z-axis upward. Note that the expression
provides a mirror image of the structure. In order to avoid a mirror image, the sequence of axes must
obey the right-hand rule.
The structure can be viewed from the position Z-axis by the expression
Other combinations of AXES and VIEW commands produce any desired views of the structure. For
example,

CSCALE =
Controls the spacing of the characters; the default value is 0.5. A value of 1.8 produces good spacing
of output characters. The CSCALE command must immediately precede the PLOTTER selection
command. If a second CSCALE command is used, a second PLOTTER selection command must
also be used.
PTITLE = {any legitimate character string}
Title to be printed at the top of the plot on the line below the sequence number. The default value
for the text is all blanks.
Undeformed Structural Plots

LABEL  - Label either the grid points and/or the

Thermal Contour Plots
Requests for thermal contour plots are similar to requests for undeformed structural plots. All axes, view, and
set commands are the same. The only changes are the addition of one CONTOUR command and one
modification to the PLOT command.
The CONTOUR command specifies that contour data is to be prepared for a subsequent plot command.
For thermal analysis, this command has the form
where “MAGNIT” is a mnemonic for a “magnitude” data request that satisfies the data processing
requirement for thermal temperature contours. The CONTOUR command should be placed immediately
before the associated PLOT execution command. A THERMAL Case Control command must appear for all
grid points that are specified in the plot set definition of contour plots.
The only change necessary to the PLOT command is the specification of CONTOUR plots. The PLOT
command then appears as:
The OUTLINE entry (optional) requests that only the outline of all the elements in the specified set be
displayed. If this entry is not specified, all of the elements included in the specified set are displayed.
To plot thermal contours at any time step of a transient analysis, the PLOT command must specify the
desired time or time range. The PLOT command then takes the form
Here the contour plot(s) is created for all parts of the model in SET i and at time steps within the range of  t1
and t2. If only  t1 is specified, the plot is generated at  t=t1.
Examples of Structure Plot Requests
The following examples are typical plot packets for thermal analysis. BEGIN BULK or OUTPUT(XYPLOT)

precedes the PLOT command and follows any AXES or VIEW commands that are explicitly present. Any
other sequence for these commands results in improperly scaled plots.
Example
The following sequence generates three plots using more spacing of characters.
The first plot is a simple undeformed structural plot of the entire model and has the title “BASIC MODEL”.
The second plot is the same type of plot for all CQUAD4 elements in the model. The plot title is “LABEL
GRIDS”. This plot has its own scale and magnification factor as requested by its unique FIND SCALE
command. The third plot is a contour plot over the entire model for the temperatures at time 5.0. Since this
plot does not have its own FIND SCALE command, the view has the same orientation as does the first plot.
Its title is “THERMAL CONTOURS.”
X-Y Plotting
In transient thermal analysis, X-Y plotting is used to track the temperature-time history or the heat flux/time
history of grid points. It can also be applied in steady state analysis to plot temperature versus a set of grid
points. In addition to the plots, X-Y tabular output may be printed or punched, and a summary of data (e.g.,
maximum and minimum values as well as the locations of these values) may be obtained for any X-Y output.
The X-Y output is requested via a packet in the Case Control Section. This packet includes all of the

X-Y Plotter Terminology
A single set of plotted X-Y pairs is known as a “curve.” Curves are the entities that the user requests to be
plotted. The surface (paper, microfilm frame, etc.) on which one or more curves is plotted is known as a
“frame.” Curves may be plotted on a whole frame, an upper-half frame, or a lower-half frame. Grid lines, tic
marks, axes, and axis labeling may be chosen by the user. The program selects defaults for parameters that
are not selected by the user. Only two commands are required for an X-Y output request. They are
X-Y output section delimiter - OUTPUT(XYPLOT) or OUTPUT(XYOUT).
At least one operation command.
The terms OUTPUT(XYPLOT) and OUTPUT(XYOUT) are interchangeable and either form may be used
for any of the X-Y output requests. If the output is limited to printing and/or punching, a plotter selection
command is not required. The operation command(s) is used to request various forms of X-Y output.
If only the required commands are used, the graphic control options assume all the default values. Curves
using default parameters have the following general characteristics:
Tic marks are drawn on all edges of the frame. Five spaces are provided on each edge of the frame.
All tic marks are labeled with their values.
Linear scales are used.
Scales are selected such that all points fall within the frame.
The plotter points are connected with straight lines.
The plotted points are not identified with symbols.
The above characteristics may be modified by inserting any number of parameter definition commands
before the operation command(s). The following is an overview of the parameter definition commands and
the operation commands for thermal analysis. A more complete description is contained in X-Y PLOT
Commands  (p.686) in the .
Parameter Definition Commands
The parameter definition commands are described in X-Y Output Command Summary  (p.686) in the . A set of
commonly used commands is listed as follows:
PLOTTER = { NAST }
Selects plotter. The default is NAST .
CLEAR
Causes all parameter values except titles (XTITLE, YTITLE, YTTITLE, YBTITLE, TCURVE) to
revert to their default values.
CSCALE = cs (Real)
See the Parameter Definition Commands Section of Structural Plotting.
CURVELINESYMBOL = cls (Integer)
Request for points to be connected by lines (cls = 0), identified by symbol |cls| (cls &amp;lt; 0), or both (cls&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0); default value is 0. The following symbols are available:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Subcase List
The subcase list generates output for the subcase numbers that are listed. The subcase list must be in
ascending order. Default is all subcases for which solutions were obtained.
Curve Request(s)
The word “frames” represents a series of curve identifiers of the following general form:
The information between slashes ( /) specifies curves that are to be drawn on the same frame. The symbol a1
identifies the grid point or element number associated with the first plot on the first frame. The symbol a2
identifies the grid point or element number associated with the second plot on the first frame. The symbols
d1 and d2 identify similar items for plots on the second frame, etc. AII plot requests on one command are
sorted by grid point or element ID to improve the efficiency of the plotting process. Symbols are assigned in
order by grid points or element identification number.
The symbols b1 and b2 are codes for the items to be plotted on the upper half of the first frame, and c1 and
c2 are codes for the items to be plotted on the lower half of the first frame. If any of the symbols b1, c1, b2,
or c2 are missing, the corresponding curve is not generated. If the comma ( ,) and c1 are absent along with
the comma ( ,) and c2, full frame plots are prepared on the first frame for the items represented by b1 and
b2. For any single frame, curve identifiers must all be of the whole frame type or all of the half frame type,
i.e., the comma ( ,) following b1 and b2 must be present for all entries or absent for all entries in a single
frame. The symbols e1, f1, e2, and f2 serve a similar purpose for the second frame, etc. If continuation
commands are needed, the previous command may be terminated with any one of the slashes ( /) or commas
(,) in the general format.
Item codes are fully described in Item Codes  (p.953) in the . For curve types OLOAD, SPCF , TEMP , and
VELO in thermal analysis, use item code T1. For X-Y plots of heat fluxes (curve type FLUX), the item codes
areCurve Type Meaning

Each half frame contains two curves. The x-direction heat fluxes of the CHEXA element number 70 and the
CPENTA element number 80 are plotted on the upper half frame. The z-direction heat fluxes are plotted on
the lower half frame for these two elements.
Example
The following sequence causes three whole frames to be plotted using the default parameter values:
Each frame contains two curves. The first plot is the enthalpy at grid points 11 and 12. The second plot is
the linear loads applied at grid points 21 and 22. The third plot is the single-point forces of constraint applied
at grid points 31 and 32.
Example
The following sequence causes two whole frame plots to be generated, one for CHBDYi element numbers
10 and 20 and the other for CHBDYi element numbers 30 and 40:
Each plot contains the free convection and radiation heat flows for two CHBDYi elements. The default

X-Y Plots for SORT1 Output
It is often convenient to display the distribution of temperature versus a sequence of grid points. The
identification numbers of the sequence of grid points to be plotted should be listed on a SET1 Bulk Data
entry.
The requests for X-Y plots appear in the Case Control Section in the standard form. For example,
This example generates an X-Y plot from grid point temperatures. The abscissa of the curve reflects the grid
point IDs listed on the SET1 Bulk Data entry with an SID of 99, and the ordinate reflects the temperatures
at these grid points. In the Bulk Data, PARAM,CURVPLOT ,1 suppresses SORT2-type processing and
requests that X-Y plots be made with the abscissas relating to grid point locations. Parameter DOPT controls
the x spacing of these curves. The allowable values of this parameter are shown in the following table:OUTPUT(XYPLOT)

Introduction to Solution Methods
This chapter describes the solution methods of MSC Nastran thermal analysis. T wo types of heat transfer
problems, steady state analysis and transient analysis, are solved by MSC Nastran. The solutions of these
analysis types, their respective MSC Nastran solution sequences, and iteration methods are discussed in the
following sections.
Nonlinear Iteration Scheme
MSC Nastran applies a Newton-Raphson iteration scheme to solve thermal (and structural) analysis
problems. In finite element analysis, the general equilibrium equation is
[K] {u} = { F} (4-1)
where:
Applying Newton’s method  involves the specification of a correction vector
(4-2)
and the approximation of the vanished correction vector  at the (i + 1)-th iteration, i.e.,
(4-3)
where
(4-4)
is the i-th incremental displacement vector. The above equation can be rewritten as
(4-5)
where:[K]=the conduction matrix (stiffness matrix )
{u}=the unknown grid point temperature vector to be solved (displacement)
{F}=the vector of known heat flows (forces)

R = –&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;63 CHAPTER 4
Main Index
At each iteration, the left-hand side matrix  [KT]i and the right-hand side vector  {R}i are computed based on
the temperature vector  {u}i. By solving the unknown vector  {u}i, the displacement vector at the
(i + 1)-th iteration can be calculated from
{u}i+1 = {u}i + {u}i(4-6)
Since matrix decomposition is time consuming, MSC Nastran does not update the left-hand side matrix at
each iteration. The tangential matrix is updated only when the solution fails to converge or the iteration
efficiency can be improved. However, the residual vector is updated at each iteration.
In concert with Newton’s method, the following options are provided to improve the efficiency of the
iteration:
Tangential matrix update strategy.
Line search method.
Bisection of loads.
Quasi-Newton (BFGS) updates.
These options are specified on NLPARM  (steady state analysis) or TSTEPNL  (transient analysis) Bulk Data
entries. In general, if the solution diverges, a line search algorithm, a bisection of loads, and a quasi-Newton&lt;br&gt;
update are implemented in an effort to improve the solution. If the solution still fails to converge with all the
above methods, the tangential stiffness is updated to resume the iteration. The user may refer to the MSC
Nastran Handbook for Nonlinear Analysis  for detailed algorithms.
Steady State Analysis
Basic Equations.  The steady state heat balance equation is
[K] {u} + [] {u + Tabs}4 = {P} + { N} (4-7)
where:
[K]=a heat conduction matrix
[]=a radiation exchange matrix&lt;br&gt;
{P}=a vector of applied heat loads that are independent of temperature&lt;br&gt;
{N}=a vector of nonlinear heat loads that are temperature dependent&lt;br&gt;
{u}=a vector of grid point temperatures&lt;br&gt;
Tabs=the absolute temperature scale adjustment required for radiation heat transfer exchange or
radiation boundary conditions when all other temperatures and units are specified in deg-F or
deg-C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Thermal Analysis User’s Guide
Steady State Analysis64
Main Index
The components of the applied heat flow vector  {P} a re associated either with surface heat transfer or with
heat generated inside the volume heat conduction elements. The vector of nonlinear heat flows  {N} results
from boundary radiation, surface convection, and temperature-dependent thermal loads.
The equilibrium equation  is solved by a Newton iteration scheme where the tangential stiffness matrix is
approximated by
(4-8)
and the residual vector  is
(4-9)
Steady State Analysis Solution Sequence
In MSC Nastran, steady state thermal analysis is solved by Solution Sequence 153 . Since Solution 153 can
be used for both structural (default) and thermal analyses, the user must include the command
in the Case Control Section of the input data for thermal analysis. The input data file may then appear as:
The NLPARM  entry is required to control the incremental and iterative solution processes. For nonlinear
problems, a set of temperatures should be provided for an initial guess. These temperatures are specified on
TEMP  and TEMPD  Bulk Data entries and are selected by a TEMP(INIT)  Case Control command.ANALYSIS  = HEAT

Convergence Criteria
The convergence criteria are characterized by the dimensionless error functions and the convergence
tolerances. To ensure accuracy and efficiency, multiple criteria with errors measured about temperatures,
loads, and energy are provided.
1.Temperature error  function
Since the error in temperatures is not known, a contraction factor q is introduced to formulate the
temperature error function, which is defined as
(4-10)
To avoid fluctuation and ill-conditioning, an averaging scheme is applied to compute the contraction
factor
(4-11)
with an initial value  q0 = 0.99. If  q is assumed to be constant with a value less than unity, the absolute
error in temperatures can be estimated by
(4-12)
The temperature error function is formulated by introducing the weighted normalization to the
above equation, i.e.,
(4-13)
where the weighting function  {} is defined as the square root of the diagonal terms of the tangential
matrix  [KT], i.e.,

The load error function is defined as

with
(4-16)
where  is the applied thermal load at the previous loading step, and  is the
incremental load.
3.Energy error  function
The energy (or work) error function is defined as
(4-17)
At every iteration, error functions are computed and printed in the convergence table under the headings
EUI, EPI, and EWI. The convergence test is performed by comparing the error functions with the
convergence tolerances, i.e.,
where EPSU, EPSP , and EPSW are tolerances specified on the NLPARM  Bulk Data entry. The solution has
converged if these tests are satisfied. However, only those criteria selected by the user (specified in the CONV
field of the NLPARM entry) are checked for convergence. Note that the tolerances should not be too tight
to waste iteration time or too loose to affect accuracy. It is recommended that the default values be used until
better values are found through iteration experience.
Iteration Control
The incremental and iterative solution processes are controlled by the parameters specified on the NLPARM
Bulk Data entry, with the data format and default values described as follows:EpRu

In thermal analysis, the arc-length method (specified by NLPCI command) is disabled. The DT , FSTRESS,
MAXR, and RTOLB fields are also ignored and should be left blank for heat transfer.
The ID field specifies an integer selected by the Case Control request NLPARM . For each subcase, load and
SPC temperature changes are processed incrementally with a number of equal subdivisions defined by the
NINC value.
The KMETHOD and KSTEP fields specify the tangential matrix update strategy. Three separate options for
KMETHOD may be selected.
AUTO
The program automatically selects the most efficient strategy based on convergence rates. At each
iteration, the number of steps required to converge as well as the computing time with and without
matrix update are estimated. The tangential matrix is updated if (a) the estimated number of
iterations to converge exceeds MAXITER, (b) the estimated time required for convergence with
current matrix exceeds the estimated time to converge with matrix update, or (c) the solution
diverges. The tangential matrix is also updated on convergence if KSTEP is less than the number of
steps required for convergence with the current matrix.
SEMI
This option is identical to the AUTO option except that the program updates the tangential matrix
after the first iteration.
ITER
The program updates the tangential matrix at every KSTEP iteration and on convergence if
KSTEP &amp;lt;MAXITER. However, the tangential matrix is never updated if KSTEP &amp;gt;MAXITER.
Note that the Newton-Raphson method is obtained if KSTEP =1, and the modified Newton-
Raphson method is selected by setting KSTEP =MAXITER.
The number of iterations for a load increment is limited to MAXITER. If the solution does not converge in
MAXITER iterations, the load increment is bisected and the analysis is repeated. If the load increment
cannot be bisected (i.e., MAXBIS is reached or MAXBIS =0) and MAXDIV is positive, the best attainable
solution is computed, and the analysis is continued to the next load increment. If MAXDIV is negative, the
analysis is terminated.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

The convergence criteria are defined through the test flags in the CONV field and the tolerances in the
EPSU, EPSP , and EPSW fields. The requested criteria (combination of temperature error U, load error P , and
energy error W) are satisfied upon convergence.
The INTOUT controls the output requests for temperatures, heat fluxes, and heat flows. If the option ALL
or YES is selected, the output requests specified in the Case Control Data are processed for every computed
load increment. If the option is NO, the output requests are processed only for the last load step of the
subcase.
The MAXDIV limits the divergence conditions allowed for each iteration. The divergence rate  Ei is defined
by the ratio of energy errors before and after the iteration, i.e.,
(4-18)
Depending on the divergence rate, the number of diverging iterations NDIV is incremented as follows:
The solution is assumed to diverge when NDIV &amp;gt;|MAXDIV |. If the solution diverges and the load
increment cannot be bisected (i.e., MAXBIS is reached or MAXBIS =0), the tangential matrix is updated
and the analysis is continued. If the solution diverges again and MAXDIV is positive, the best attainable
solution is computed, and the analysis is continued to the next load increment. If MAXDIV is negative, the
analysis is terminated on the second divergence.
The BFGS  update is performed if MAXQN &amp;gt;0. As many as MAXQN quasi-Newton vectors can be
accumulated. The BFGS update with these QN vectors provides a secant modulus in the search direction. If
MAXQN is reached, the tangential matrix is updated, and the accumulated QN vectors are purged. The
accumulation resumes at the next iteration.
The line search is performed if MAXLS &amp;gt;0. In the line search, the temperature increment is scaled to
minimize the energy error. The line search is not performed if the absolute value of the relative energy error
is less than the tolerance LSTOL or if the number of line searches reaches MAXLS.
The number of bisections for a load increment is limited to |MAXBIS|. Different actions are taken when the
solution diverges, depending on the sign of MAXBIS. If MAXBIS is positive, the tangential matrix is updated
on the first divergence, and the load is bisected on the second divergence. If MAXBIS is negative, the load is
bisected every time the solution diverges until the limit on bisection is reached. If the solution does not
converge after |MAXBIS| bisections, the analysis is continued or terminated depending on the sign of
MAXDIV.

The solver also prints diagnostic messages requested by DIAG 50  or 51  in the Executive Control Section.
DIAG 50  only prints subcase status and NLPARM  data, while DIAG 51 prints all data at each iteration. In
general, the user should be cautioned against using DIAG 51, because it is used for debugging purposes and
the volume of output is significant. It is recommended that DIAG 51  be used only for small test problems.
The diagnostic output is summarized as follows:
For each entry into NLITER, the following is produced:

Main Index
For highly nonlinear problems, the iterative solution is sensitive to the initial temperature guess. It is
recommended to overshoot (i.e., make a high initial guess) the estimated temperature vector in a
radiation-dominated problem.
Incremental load:
Incremental loading reduces the imbalance of the equilibrium equation caused by applied loads.
The single-point constraints (temperature specified by SPC in the Bulk Data) and the applied loads
(specified by QBDY1 , QBDY2 , QBDY3 , QHBDY , QVECT , and QVOL ) can be incremented. If
the solution takes more iterations than the default values of the maximum number of iterations
allowed for convergence (MAXITER), the increment size should be decreased. For linear problems,
no incremental load steps are required.
Convergence criteria:
At the beginning stages of a new analysis, it is recommended that the defaults be used on all options.
However, the UPW option may be selected to improve the efficiency of convergence. For problems
with poor convergence, the tolerances EPSU, EPSP , and EPSW can be increased within the limits of
reasonable accuracy.

The TSTEPNL  entry is required to specify the initial time step and the iteration control. Initial temperatures

As the solution progresses, the time steps are adjusted automatically by an adaptive time stepping scheme,
which is described in the following section. It is up to the user to specify a reasonable initial time step size. A

The adjusted time step size is limited to the upper and lower bounds, i.e.,
(4-39)
where DT is the user-specified time increment and MAXR and MAXBIS are user-defined entries specified
on the TSTEPNL entry. The time step is set to the limit if it falls outside the bounds.
When the time marches to a value close to the last time specified by the user, the adaptive stepping scheme
stops for the current subcase. The termination criterion is

during the analysis, the actual number of time steps may not be equal to NDT. However, the total time
duration is close to  NDT  DT.
For printing and plotting purposes, data recovery is performed at time steps O, NO, 2 • NO, &amp;hellip;, and the last
converged step. The Case Control command OTIME may also be used to control the output times.
Since both linear and nonlinear problems are solved by the same solution sequence, only the ADAPT option
can be selected in the METHOD field for heat transfer. The ADAPT method automatically adjusts the
incremental time and uses bisection. During the bisection process, the heat capacitance matrix and the
tangential stiffness matrix are updated every KSTEP-th converged bisection solution.
The number of iterations for a time step is limited to MAXITER. If MAXITER is negative, the analysis is
terminated on the second divergence condition during the same time step or when the solution diverges for
five consecutive time steps. If MAXITER is positive, the program computes the best solution and continues
the analysis until divergence occurs again. If the solution does not converge in MAXITER iterations, the
process is considered divergent. Either bisection or matrix update is activated when the process diverges.
The convergence criteria are defined through the test flags in the CONV field and the tolerances in the
EPSU, EPSP , and EPSW fields. The requested criteria (combination of temperature error U, load error P ,
and work error W) are satisfied upon convergence. Note that at least two iterations are required to check the
temperature convergence criterion.
MAXDIV limits the divergence conditions allowed for each iteration. Depending on the divergence rate, the
number of diverging iteration NDIV is incremented as follows:
(4-41)
where:
The solution is assumed to diverge when NDIV reaches MAXDIV. If the bisection option is used, the time
step is bisected upon divergence. Otherwise, the left-hand side matrices are updated, and the computation
for the current time step is repeated. If NDIV reaches MAXDIV again within the same time step, the analysis
is terminated.
The BFGS update and the line search process are performed in the same way as in steady state analysis.
Nonzero values of MAXQN and MAXLS activate the quasi-Newton update and the line search process,
respectively.=

The number of bisections for a load increment is limited to |MAXBIS|. Different actions are taken when the
solution diverges, depending on the sign of MAXBIS. If MAXBIS is positive and the solution does not
converge after MAXBIS bisections, the best solution is computed and the analysis is continued to the next
time step. If MAXBIS is negative and the solution does not converge in |MAXBIS| bisections, the analysis is
terminated.
ADJUST controls the automatic time stepping in the following ways:
1.If ADJUST = 0, the automatic adjustment is deactivated.
2.If ADJUST &amp;gt; 0, the time increment is continually adjusted for the first few steps until a good value
of  is obtained. After this initial adjustment, the time increment is adjusted every ADJUST-th time
step only.
3.If ADJUST is one order greater than NDT, the automatic adjustment is deactivated after the initial
adjustment.
Parameters MSTEP and RB are used to adjust the time increment. The upper and lower bounds of time step
size are defined with MAXR. If the solution approaches steady state (checked by tolerance UTOL), the time
step size is doubled. Detailed computations involving these parameters are described in the previous section.

Diagnostic messages are requested by DIAG 50 or 51 in the Executive Control Section. DIAG 50 only prints
subcase status, TSTEPNL data, and iteration summary, while DIAG 51 prints all data at each iteration. In
general, the user should be cautioned against using DIAG 51, because it is used for debugging purposes only
and the volume of output is significant. It is recommended that DIAG 51 be used only for small test
problems. The diagnostic output is summarized as follows:

Recommendations
The following are recommendations designed to aid the user.
Time step size
To avoid inaccurate or unstable results, a proper initial time step associated with spatial mesh size is
suggested. The selection criterion is
(4-50)
where  t is the time step, n is the modification number of the time scale,  x is the mesh size
(smallest element dimension),   is the material density,  cp is the specific heat, and k is the thermal
conductivity. A suggested value of n is 10. For highly nonlinear problems, a small step size is
recommended.z1

Numerical stability
Numerical stability is controlled by the parameter   (specified on the PARAM,NDAMP Bulk Data
entry). For linear problems,   = 0 (i.e., no numerical damping) is adequate, but for nonlinear
problems a larger value of   may be advisable. Increasing the value of   improves numerical stability;
however, the solution accuracy is reduced. The recommended range of values is from 0.0 to 0.1
(default value is 0.01).
Initial temperatures and boundary temperatures
The specification of initial temperatures and boundary condition temperatures should be consistent.
For a given point, the initial temperature should be equal to the boundary condition temperature at
t = 0.
Convergence criteria
At the beginning stages of a new analysis, it is recommended that the defaults be used on all options.
However, the UPW option may be selected to improve the efficiency of convergence. For nonlinear
problems with time-varying boundary conditions, the U option must be selected, because the large
conductance (internally generated) affects the calculations of the PW error functions. For problems
with poor convergence, the tolerances EPSU, EPSP , and EPSW can be increased within the limits of
reasonable accuracy.
Fixed time step
If a fixed time step is desired, the adaptive time stepping can be deactivated by setting ADJUST = 0
on the TSTEPNL Bulk Data.&lt;/p&gt;

Free Convection  Forms
Ambient Nodes
Discussion
We introduce the CHBDY  surface element for the purpose of applying free convection boundary conditions
along the length of the rod. The Bulk Data entry CONV  defines the convection character and the ambient
grid points. T o take advantage of empirical relationships for this type of flow field, a hand calculation is
necessary to acquire the appropriate free convection heat transfer coefficient form. T o facilitate this process,
we will assume a fluid film temperature of 800 degrees and use the fluid properties for air at that temperature
in our calculations. In Example 1c - Temperature Dependent Heat Transfer Coefficient , 103 we will account for the
variation of film temperature and corresponding fluid properties along the length of the rod.

Demonstrated Principles
Temperature dependent free convection  heat transfer coefficient
Film node
Discussion
This problem introduces the generalized method for representation of temperature dependent properties
(MATT4,TABLEMi ). In this case we wish to account for the fluid film temperature variation along the
length of our rod and consider its effect on the local heat transfer coefficient. By default, the look-up
temperature of the film node is the average temperature of the CHBDY surface and the ambient points. This
temperature varies along the length of the rod.&lt;/p&gt;

Example 1d - Film Nodes for Free Convection
Demonstrated Principles
Film nodes
MPCs
Discussion
In the spirit of the previous example, we allow the free convection heat transfer coefficient to be temperature
dependent; however, we extend the notion of the film node to provide a film temperature look-up value more
heavily weighted toward the local surface temperatures than the ambient temperature. The MPC  (multipoint
constraint) relationship is available for this purpose. In this example, the film node temperatures become the
average of the two CHBDY surface grid points each with a weight of 1.0, and the ambient temperature is also
given a weighting of 1.0. Note that the default film node has a temperature which is the average of the average
of the surface temperature and ambient point temperatures.
For example, consider the first CHBDY  element:

Discussion
Radiation heat transfer is added along the length of the rod from our previous examples. For this case we treat
the problem as one in which radiant exchange occurs between the rod and an ambient environment at
300K. This can be modeled simply with a radiation boundary condition specification. Surface emissivity
variation with temperature is also accounted for. Radiation exchange from the end of the rod has been
included to illustrate the POINT type CHBDY  element.&lt;/p&gt;

Discussion
Examples 2a, 2b, and 2c  describe MSC Nastran heat transfer “loads”.  While we tend to think of boundary
conditions in regard to heat transfer, there are several surface conditions which we define as loads.  In an MSC
Nastran sense, a load has the flexibility of being subcase selectable.  This concept, an early carryover from
structural analysis, allows the load vector to vary while the stiffness matrix and its decomposition remain
unchanged.  This provided an economical method for evaluating the effects of multiple loading states and
superposition of loads.  The load set/subcase capability is less significant for heat transfer since many
boundary conditions have contributions to the coefficient matrix and are fundamentally nonlinear,
eliminating any potential for superposition of loads.  In this series of examples, a single CHEXA element is
used to demonstrate the application of internal heat generation, free convection, control nodes, film nodes,
and various nonlinear effects.  The temperature dependence of the heat transfer coefficient and the heat
generation rate illustrated are used.
Example 2a - Nonlinear Internal Heating and Free Convection  demonstrates the selection of the internal heat
generation load QVOL .  A control node, which is a member of the element grid point set, has been chosen
to multiply the heat generation term as well as be the film node.  We refer to this as local control.  The free
convection exponent, EXPF , is set to 0.0 (FORM = 0).  The analytic expression for this example is given in
(5-1).
The basic energy balance can be expressed as:&lt;/p&gt;

Free Convection Forms
Discussion of Variation 1
This problem extends Example 2a - Nonlinear Internal Heating and Free Convection  in the implementation of local
control for the internal heat generation control node and the film node for convection.  However, the same
control node is now used to multiply the convection heat transfer coefficient.  The free convection exponent
EXPF remains at 0.0 (FORM = 0).
The basic energy balance can be expressed as:

Free Convection Forms
Discussion of Variation 1
This problem provides another example of the use of film nodes. In our previous examples, the film node
was chosen to be an element grid point, meaning that the TABLEM  look-up temperature for the temperature
dependent heat transfer coefficient was the actual body temperature.  More often than not, the look-up
temperature should be some weighted average of the surface temperature and ambient temperature.  In this
case, the default value (a blank entry) for the film node depicts that the average of the CHBDY surface
element and the associated ambient point temperatures provide the TABLEM  look up temperature
(FORM =0).  The analytic expression for this case is given in (5-4):
The basic energy balance can be expressed as:

Discussion of Variation 2
(5-5) describes a variation of this problem which has the control nodes removed and the value of 0.2
introduced for EXPF (FORM =0).  It should be noted that the elimination of the control nodes alone would
have no effect on the analysis since they would have cancelled out of the prior equations.
The basic energy balance can be expressed as:

Example 3 - Axisymmetric Elements  and Boundary
Conditions
Demonstrated Principles
Axisymmetric Modeling
Axisymmetric Surface Elements
Discussion
Axisymmetric geometric models may be constructed using the CTRIAX6  element only.  For this element,
the grid point locations are input as R,THETA,Z where the axis of symmetry is the Z axis.  The grid points
lie in the RZ plane (THETA = 0.0).  In this example we demonstrate the CHBDYE  statement for identifying
the surface element to which the boundary condition is to be applied.  The surface type is automatically
accounted for with this specification. If the CHBDYG  had been used, a TYPE field of REV would be
specified.  For reference, any applied loads of a flux nature have a total load applied to the structure that is
calculated based on the entire circumferential surface area.

Demonstrated Principles
Flux Load  Application
Radiation to Space
Discussion
This series of radiative equilibrium problems illustrates various methods of flux load application and radiation
exchange with space.  The first example uses a nondirectional heat flux load to represent a solar source.  A
simple radiation boundary condition to space represents the loss mechanism.  A blackbody surface is initially
presumed.

Solar Load with Radiation Boundary Condition
Demonstrated Principle
Directional Solar Heat Flux  Loads
Discussion
Heat loads from a distant source can be treated in a directional sense with the QVECT  Bulk Data entry. The
absorptivity is made available from a RADM  Bulk Data entry. In this case, the radiation boundary condition
also uses this absorptivity in its exchange relationship. For illustrative purposes, the angle of incidence was
varied to create a plot of equilibrium temperature versus  .

Example 4c - Plate in Radiative Equilibrium, Directional
Solar Load, Spectral Surface Behavior
Demonstrated Principles
Solar Loads
Spectral Radiation  Surface Behavior
Discussion
Wavelength dependent surface properties can be incorporated in the radiation boundary condition or any
radiation enclosure. For this simple radiative equilibrium problem, we demonstrate the principles by using a
perfectly selective surface-a surface that behaves like a perfect blackbody  ( = 1.0) below some finite cutoff
wavelength and does not participate above that wavelength. Appendix G describes the mathematics
underlying the waveband approximation to spectral radiation exchange. The RADBND  Bulk Data entry
supplies the wavelength break points and the RADM  Bulk Data entry provides the band emissivities. The
solar source (QVECT ) for the analysis is treated as a blackbody at a temperature of 10400 R.
