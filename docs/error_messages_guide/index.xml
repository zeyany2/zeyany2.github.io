Overview of Error Messages
Main Index
Overview of Error Messages
MSC Nastran displays User Information, User Warning, and User Fatal messages in the printed output. The amount of
information reported in a message is controlled by The Nastran entry NASTRAN XMSG. When XMSG=0 is the default;
only message summaries are reported. When XMSG=1, the full messages are reported.
MSC Nastran is improving its messages, and for these improved messages, XMSG will have no effect. For example:
User messages typically indicate problems with the input file. Corrective action is often indicated in the message text.
Refer to the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide for proper input file formats.
Warning and information messages appear at various places in the output.
Fatal messages will cause the program to terminate. These messages will appear at the end of the output and will often give
corrective action.
Operating system specific messages can appear in the MSC Nastran output. The format of these messages will vary with
the operating system. You should refer to your operating system manuals for interpretation of these messages.*** USER FATAL MESSAGE 4291 (EQD4S)

User information : The above grid point and component are defined in each of the above dependent sub -
sets. A point may belong to a maximum of one dependent subset. This error occurs when a DOF is defined
as belonging to two mutually exclusive sets. A common example of this occurs when a DOF is defined as
dependent an MPC (M-set) as well as being constrained (s-set) on an SPC entry. The message for this states
that the component is illegally defined in the um (user-defined m-set) and us (user-defined s-set) sets. These
two sets are mutually exclusive because all MPC equations are processed before the SPCs are applied
(exception is SOL 24) and the m-set DOFs are removed from the matrix. When the program attempts pply
the SPC, the DOF is no longer available, and the FATAL message is issued. The normal correction for this
is to modify the MPC so that the DOF in question is independent (N-set). Then there is no conflict.

MODULE %1 HAS BEEN REQUESTED TO DO UNSYMMETRIC DECOMPOSITION OF A
SYMMETRIC MATRIX.
User information : The matrix to be solved has a matrix trailer that indicates that it is symmetric
(&amp;ldquo;FORM=6&amp;rdquo;). The DMAP call requests that the unsymmetric decomposition algorithm be used. The
symmetric algorithm is more economical that the unsymmetric algorithm, and unconditionally stable for
positive-definite matrices.

algorithm is required.

User information : The module has been instructed to perform the symmetric decomposition algorithm in
the DMAP call, but the trailer of the input matrix indicates that it is not of Form 6. If the matrix should be
symmetric, a MODTRL module call can be scheduled before the module to convert the matrix trailer to
Form 6. If this message is encountered in a solution sequence,it is a signal that a solution is being requested
for a system (unsymmetric matrices) for which it was not designed. Wrong answers may result if the

is not intended to process unsymmetric matrices.
Programmer action: If the matrix is intended to be symmetric, then the MODTRL module may be used to
convert the matrix trailer to Form 6 but wrong answers may result. Alternatively, the CEAD module may
be used for perform an eigenvalue analysis with unsymmetric matrices.

3007.0 ILLEGAL INPUT TO SUBROUTINE %1
BUFFER ASSIGNED WHEN OPENING DATA BLOCK %1,FILE %2,
System information:
Subroutine %1 has encountered data which it cannot process. This error should not be caused by user
input data, except as described in the next paragraphs. A system or programming error is indicated. Go
directly to the subroutine listing or description to determine the exact cause of the problems.
This message occurs in superelement or module analysis when restarting improperly. The illegal input
message is usually caused by a purged input file.
One example is if the subroutine is CALCV. A common cause of this error is when attempting to perform
a PARTN (or MERGE) on matrices with null partitioning vectors, or attempting to perform UPARTN (or
UMERGE) on a matrix for which the original set is the same size as the final set. In this case, the
partitioning vector generated by the program is null and this error is generated. In CALCV, if the DMAP
partition &amp;ldquo;hard-coded&amp;rdquo; and the set does not exist, you&amp;rsquo;ll get this error. For example, if a UPARTN module
is using the Q-set, but the user hasn&amp;rsquo;t used any Q set entries, this error will be issued. One remedy is to
conditionally jump over the problem DMAP based on parameters such as NOQSET, NORSET, etc.

Programmer information:  LOCATION KEY = %3
System information:
This message implies that the particular subroutine does not have sufficient memory to meet its demands.
The subroutine or module description should be consulted to determine the memory requirements.
If an increase in memory is desired for only the module producing the error, an alter must be included in
the Executive section of the input file. An example of the alter is included below.
COMPILE DMAP=dmap,SOUIN=source $ source=MSCSOU or USRSOU ALTER #
$ before module TYPE PARM,,I,N,MVAL $
MVAL = GETSYS(MVAL,57) PUTSYS(value1,57) $
value1=increased memory value
ALTER #
$ after module PUTSYS(MVAL,57) $
ENDALTER $
One cause observed for this in the Bulk Data SORT module is too many continuation entries. An
avoidance is to have the Bulk Data already sorted and to increase available memory. Also, large THRU
ranges can cause excessive memory to be used.

rows of [B] the number of columns of [C] must be equal to the number of columns of [B] and the number
of rows of [C] must be equal to the number of columns of [A]. One cause of this is if the model in a cyclic

coordinate system at a Gauss point. Reason 13 may be due to a negative 12I/T3 (PSHELL). Reason 14 is
due to zero transverse shear thickness (PSHELL). Reason 21 occurs if the isoparametric mapping is unrea -
sonable, which can occur if the midside nodes are too close to the corners.

User information: The stiffness matrix is inspected for singularities before any user-supplied unsymmetric
terms are allowed. The solution technique makes it unlikely that correct answers will result if unsymmetric
terms exist. When these tests are made, the three-by-three stiffness matrix terms printed are the terms about
the diagonal of the listed grid point, normalized to the largest term in the three-by-three submatrix. Likely
causes are unsymmetric terms from user-supplied matrices, downstream superelements whose upstream
members have mechanisms suppressed due to use of PARAM,MAXRATIO or PARAM,BAILOUT, or
errors in MSC NASTRAN code. If the stiffness terms were generated from MSC NASTRAN elements
rather than matrices from outside MSC NASTRAN, and no large factor-to-diagonal messages are present,

The number of static load cases (%1) in the external superelement (%2) is not the same as the number of
static load cases (%3) in the downstream superelement (%4).
User information: Firstly, the external superelement load cases will be assembled in the same sequence as
the downstream superelement load cases. For example, the first external load case will be assembled into the
first downstream superelement load case, the second external load case will be assembled into the second
downstream superelement load case, etc.
Secondly,
1.If the number of external superelement load cases is less than the number of downstream
superelement load cases then the undefined external load cases are assumed to be null. For example,
if there is one external case and four downstream cases then the 2nd through 4th external cases are
assumed to be null in the downstream cases.
2.If the number of external superelement load cases is greater than the number of downstream
superelement load cases then the extra external superelement load cases will be ignored. For example,
if there are four external load cases and one downstream superelement case then the 2nd through 4th
external cases will be ignored in the downstream cases.
User action:  Consider using the SELOAD Bulk Data entry to select and/or scale the external superele -
ment&amp;rsquo;s loads. If not then:
1.If this is a static analysis then add or reduce the number of subcases in the external superelement&amp;rsquo;s

superelement.
2.If this is a frequency or transient response analysis then add or reduce the number of subcases in the

ascending EXCITEIDs in the downstream superelement.

THE MODAL MASS MATRIX IS NOT POSITIVE DEFINITE.
User information:  The modal mass matrix cannot be decomposed by the Cholesky algorithm after merging
elastic and free-body modes. (Cholesky decomposition is used to orthogonalize the eigenvectors with
respect to the mass matrix.) Causes include the input of negative masses and the calculation of eigenvectors
for eigenvalues approaching machine infinity. Inspect the model or ask for fewer eigenvectors using of the
F2 option. When this condition occurs, the eigenvectors are not orthogonalized r normalized. The second
parameter of the READ or REIGL module is given a negative sign. This parameter is used in the solution
sequences to branch to an error exit after printing the real eigenvalue table. You may use a DMAP Alter to
print these eigenvectors if the cause of the problem is not apparent in the eigenvalues. The solution can be
forced to completion by changing the sign of this parameter. You should be aware that a poor quality of
solution is provided for this case. This poor solution may be useful for diagnosing the problem but
should not be used for other purposes. The error can occur when large offsets (large relative to the element
length) are used for the BEAM element and coupled mass is selected.

A negative term in matrix %1 is being raised to an exponent that is not a whole number.
User information : The DIAGONAL module allows raising terms in matrices to non-integer exponents
with the WHOLE option. Whenever the matrix terms are negative, the exponentiation fails if the term is
greater than the 3rd parameter of the DIAGONAL module. The 3rd parameter&amp;rsquo;s default is 0.0.
The PARAMR module performs a similar function with real parameters and the POWER option.
These special applications may be performed by alternate DMAP modules depending upon the exponenti -
ation the user wishes.

NEGATIVE TERM ON DIAGONAL OF MASS(VIBRATION) OR STIFFNESS(BUCKLING)
MATRIX DETECTED.
ROW NUMBER = %1 VALUE = %2
User information : The message is given from the REIGL module which performs a necessary (but not suf -
ficient) check on the positive semi-definiteness of the indicated matrix. Look for evidence of negative mass,
such as minus signs on input. Negative terms on the factor of the indicated matrix
must be removed for correct answers.
Something has caused a negative term on the diagonal of the mass or stiffness matrix. Look for explicitly
defined negative mass and/or stiffness terms. Also, check the continuation entries on the PBEAM entry. An
incorrect entry for the SO field may lead to improper mass definition. For example, if SO is set to NO at a
particular X/XB location, the continuation entry for defining four stress locations on the cross section (C,
D, E, F) is not used. If SO is NO but the C, D, E, and F points are entered in error, negative mass terms
can result if either E1 or E2 entries are entered. The offending DOF can be traced using the USET tables.
The Lanczos method gives wrong answers for indefinite matrices. The existence of negative diagonal terms
indicates a subclass of indefinite matrix.
See the MSC NASTRAN Numerical Methods User&amp;rsquo;s Guide for more information.

BAD GEOMETRY FOR QUAD4 ELEMENT ID =%1 THE TAPER OF %2 EXCEEDS THE MAXI -
MUM VALUE OF %3
User action : THE TOLERANCE MAY BE ADJUSTED WITH Q4TAPER KEYWORD ON THE
NASTRAN STATEMENT.
User information : Bad geometry can cause incorrect answers for CQUAD4 elements. The bad geometry
warning may be neglected if the element is in a non- critical part of the model, or if the element stress is
constant. If the element is in a critical part of the model, you are advised to refine your model so these bad
geometries do not occur. Skew and taper are representative of the amount that a CQUAD4 deviates
from being rectangular. Skew is the angle between the lines that join opposite midsides. When this angle is
less than 30 degrees the message is issued. For no skew this angle is 90 degrees. Taper is computed as fol -
lows: Connect opposite grid points and compute the area of the enclosed triangles. Ji is 1/2 of the area asso -
ciated with grid i and the adjacent grids of the enclosed triangle. Ja is 1/4 of J1+J2+J3+J4. If ABS((Ji-Ja)/Ja)
exceeds 0.5 then the message is issued. (The equation equals 0.0 if there is no taper.) Another way to think
of taper is the ratio of the areas on the two sides of a diagonal; if the ratio is greater than 3, then the taper
test fails. Note that these tests concern only geometry, and are made prior to the analysis. Another useful
test, made after the analysis, is the stress discontinuity calculation.

User information:
If this message is issued in the symbolic phase, the memory estimate is not necessarily conservative and even
more memory may be required (although this estimate is fairly accurate for Version 68). Also, the memory
increase required is only for the symbolic phase. It is not unusual for the decomposition phase to require
more memory than the symbolic phase. To increase the chances for a successful run, increase the memory
even more than the amount indicated in this message. After the run is complete, determine the amount of
memory actually used and use this as a guideline for similar runs in the future. The user information mes -
sage is written if SYSTEM(166) = 1 (that is, if there is not enough memory for sparse decomposition, then
switch to regular decomposition).

User information: Offsets were specified on the shell connection Bulk Data entry, CQUAD4, CTRIA3,

User information:
This message is issued by the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) method which is used by the curve-fit -

for estimation of the material parameters is rank deficient, i.e., the rank is less than the number of material

fitting. The program will proceed to find a non-unique solution. However, it is best to try to avoid rank
deficiency by providing more experimental data for curve fitting or lowering the order of the strain energy

User information: This may occur if BUFFSIZE is too large. See the MSC NASTRAN Installation and

two jobs is acceptable. Another cause is if a restart is attempted from a database in which the MASTER is
split into multiple physical files. An avoidance is to explicitly point to the physical name associated with the
MASTER DBsets on ASSIGN statements. See Error Report 2953 in section 17.4 of MSC NASTRAN

IF THE MODEL HAS PASSED THE PREVIOUS CHECKS FOR THE G-SET AND N-SET,
THEN SOME POSSIBLE CAUSES ARE:
1.THE MODEL IS NOT INTENDED TO BE FREE-FREE WHICH INDICATES THAT THE
MODEL IS PROPERLY CONSTRAINED TO GROUND;
2.THE REFERENCE GRID POINT (GRID=GID ON THE GROUNDCHECK COMMAND)
IS LOCATED TOO FAR FROM THE MODEL&amp;rsquo;S CENTER OF GRAVITY. IT IS
RECOMMENDED THAT THE REFERENCE GRID POINT BE LOCATED AS CLOSE AS
POSSIBLE TO THE MODEL&amp;rsquo;S CENTER OF GRAVITY OF THE MODEL (SEE THE GRID
POINT WEIGHT GENERATOR OUTPUT);
3.PARAM,AUTOSPC,YES CONSTRAINS NEAR-SINGULAR DEGREES-OF-FREEDOM.
WHEN A FINITE ELEMENT MODEL WITH AUTOSPC FAILS THE A-SET CHECK, IT IS
NOT EVIDENT THAT GROUNDING HAS OCCURRED. THE USE OF PARAM,SNORM
WILL NOT ELIMINATE THE SPURIOUS FAILURE.&lt;/p&gt;

THE ADAMSMNF CASE CONTROL COMMAND HAS SPECIFIED A PLOT SET ID (PSETID =
%1) TO SELECT ELEMENTS AND GRIDS FOR OUTPUT PURPOSES AND ALSO SPECIFIED
THAT NO MASS INVARIANTS BE OUTPUT. THIS COMBINATION CANNOT BE HONORED.
PLOT SETS ARE IGNORED.
User information: A PSETID has selected a plot set that will be used to reduce the size of the model stored
to the MNF. This feature can only be used if mass invariants are also generated and stored. Since no mass
invariant output was requested, usage of a plot set is not possible and is being ignored. Data for all elements
and grids present in the superelement or module will be output.
User action: If a plot set is desired, use the ADAMSMNF Case Control Command MINVAR describer to
select an option other than NONE.

User information: The ADAMSMNF Case Control Command has specified a plot set, but the plot set
could not be located in the PLOT sets. It was located in the case control set ID list however. This Case
Control SET list was used to examine the PLOT sets for set IDs listed in the Case Control SET Command.
The specified set could not be located and is being ignored.
User action: If PSETID was to select a set from the OUTPUT(PLOT) SETs, then ensure that an OUT -
PUT(PLOT) packet exists in the Case Control section and that the requested SET is defined. If the
PSETID is being used to select a Case Control set that references SETs in the OUTPUT(PLOT) section,
then ensure that all of the SET IDs specified in the Case Control set list are present and defined in the
OUTPUT(PLOT) section and that the Case Control contains a definition for the specified set.
