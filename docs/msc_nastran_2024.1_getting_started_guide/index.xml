        &lt;p&gt;177 Chapter 9: Applying Static Loads
Main Index
First, observe that the force of gravity (g) acts in the -Y direction. We must tell MSC Nastran which way is
down (or, more precisely, where the center of the earth is). Thus, the vector  can be written as:
(9-3)
The acceleration due to gravity on the Earth’s surface is approximately  ( ) or
. Recall that length units must be consistent throughout the model (this example uses inches).
Hence, the GRAV entry in the tabular format is:
And, in the free field format,
GRAV , 15,,386.4,0 .,-1.,0.
The Case Control command required to apply this load is LOAD = 15.
Now assume that a concentrated force is added to the beam as shown:
What is the tip deflection of the cantilever beam due to its own weight and the concentrated force?
To combine gravity loading with the concentrated force, the following approach must be used:1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Getting Started Guide 178
Main Index
The essential idea is that the set ID on a GRAV entry may not be the same as the Set ID on any other load
entry.
As a final example, suppose you are analyzing an instrument package subjected to inertial loads in specific
directions, say:
Three separate GRAV entries can be written as:
Enforced Displacements
Static Element Deformation (DEFORM)
The DEFORM Bulk Data entry is used to apply an axial deformation to line elements in statics problems.
The format of the DEFORM  entry is shown below:In Case Control: LOAD = 15

Main Index
The DEFORM entry is selected in the Case Control Section with the command DEFORM=SID. From one
to three enforced element deformations may be defined on a single entry. Note that a positive value of Di
represents elongation and a negative value represents contraction.
Enforced Displacement Value (SPCD)
Enforced  grid point displacements in static analysis may be applied using the SPCD Bulk Data entry. SPCD
has the following format:
For static solutions, the load set ID (SID) is selected by the Case Control command LOAD =SID.
Combining Loads (LOAD)
The LOAD entry defines a static load as a linear combination  (superposition) of load sets defined using the
FORCE, MOMENT, FORCE1, MOMENT1, FORCE2, MOMENT2, PLOAD, PLOAD1, PLOAD2,
PLOAD3, PLOAD4, PLOADX, SLOAD, SPCD, RFORCE, or GRAV entries.Field Contents Values

The resulting combined load is determined by:
(9-4)
where  represents the applied load vector corresponding to load set ID Li.
All load set IDs (Li in the equation above) must be unique. The LOAD entry must be used if acceleration
loads (the GRAV entry) are to be used with any other type of load (e.g., FORCE). Up to 300 (Si, Li) pairs
may be used with one LOAD entry.
Example
Assume that your model has one concentrated force of 15.2 lbs in the y direction applied to grid point 12,
and one concentrated moment of 6.4 inch-lbs about the x-axis applied to grid point 127. It is required to
double the value of force and triple the value of moment for your next analysis.
The LOAD Bulk Data entry may be written with an overall scale factor (S) of 1.0 and loadset scale factors
(Si) of 2.0 for force and 3.0 for moment. Hence,
In Case Control:
LOAD = 22
In Bulk Data:

Main Index
subcases can be combined to create additional subcases using the SUBCOM (Case)  command. Coefficients
defining the linear combination of a SUBCOM are specified on a SUBSEQ (Case)  or a SUBSTEP  (Case)  command.
A SUBSEQ or a SUBSEQ1 command is required for each SUBCOM subcase.
The use of subcases is best illustrated with an example. The Case Control Section for an equipment rack
analysis is shown in Listing 9-1.
Listing 9-1  SUBCASE and SUBCOM Case Control Section
Above the first SUBCASE delimiter (known as above the subcase level), we have the following:
TITLE means that EQUIPMENT RACK ANALYSIS will appear on each page of output in all
subcases.
ECHO = BOTH will cause both sorted and unsorted Bulk Data listings to be printed for each
subcase.
SPC = 20 defines the model’s constraint set, which remains the same for each subcase.
SET 1 = 1 THRU 50 defines a set of entities with IDs from 1 to 50.
DISP = 1 refers to set 1, and will cause the displacements of grid points 1 through 50 to be
printed for all subcases unless overridden within a subcase (as occurs in subcases 1
and 2).CEND

The subtitles or labels in each subcase or subcom are added to the title EQUIPMENT RACK ANALYSIS.
The SUBSEQ entries have the following meaning:
In SUBCOM 10:&lt;br&gt;
In SUBCOM 20:
SUBSEQ1
An alternative method of performing load combinations is to use the SUBSEQ1 option. This is very
benefition when a large number of loadcases/SUBCASE and only a few SUBCASES are combined. Using
this technique, the alternative format for SUBCOM20 would have been:
SUBCOM20
SUBTITLE = Load Combination 2
Lable = same
SUBSEQ1 = 1.0, 1.0,1, -1.5,3SUBSEQ =1.0 (SUBCASE 1 Load) + 1.0 (SUBCASE 2 Load) + 0.0 (SUBCASE 3 Load)
=1.0 (LOAD SET 10) + 1.0 (LOAD SET 20)
=1.0  Dead Load + 1.0  NW Wind Load
Note:   When using SUBSEQ, a coefficient must be given for each of the preceding subcases. A
coefficient of 0.0 indicates that a subcase does not contribute to the SUBCOM. However. the
0.0 placeholder must still be present.
SUBSEQ = 1.0 (SUBCASE 1 Load) + 0.0 (SUBCASE 2 Load) - 1.5 (SUBCASE 3 Load)
=1.0 (LOAD SET 10) - 1.5 (LOAD SET 30)

&lt;p&gt;Printing the Input File (ECHO)
A MSC Nastran model resides in a .dat  text file. The .dat  file is submitted to MSC Nastran and an .f06&lt;br&gt;
results file is produced. The following ECHO (Case)  Case Control command produces sorted and unsorted
model file listings, called echoes, at the beginning of the .f06  file:
ECHO=BOTH
The unsorted input file is an exact copy of the Executive Control, Case Control , and Bulk Data Sections of
the input  (.dat) file, including comment ($) entries. The sorted input file is a listing of the Bulk Data Section
with entries rearranged in alphabetical order and with comments removed. In addition, the sorted Bulk Data
is expanded to ten fields, each eight columns wide. Therefore, if the .dat  file is entered in free field format,
it appears in small field format in the sorted Bulk Data listing. This small field format listing is especially
helpful when reviewing the model’s Bulk Data Section.
Examples of unsorted  and sorted  input listings are shown in Listing 10-1 and Listing 10-2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other options for the ECHO command include:
While learning to use MSC Nastran by using small models, it is useful to set ECHO to BOTH. The resulting
listings in the .f06  file will not occupy very much space and having the model information available can be
useful. However, when the models become very large, it may be best to use ECHO = PUNCH or even
ECHO = NONE.
Output Titles (TITLE, SUBTITLE, LABEL)
Up to three title lines  per page of MSC Nastran output are available by using the TITLE (Case) , SUBCASE (Case) ,
and LABEL (Case)  Case Control commands. Any character string can be used. Titles are optional but highly
recommended-without them, one MSC Nastran job looks pretty much like another.
Example
The Case Control commands listed below produce the following headings on each page of output:

Case Control Sets (SET)
A Case Control set  is a collection of grid point IDs or element IDs for use in output requests. Case Control
sets are used to obtain output for a selected portion of the model. Case Control sets are defined with the SET
(Case)  command according to the following formats:
where n is the set identification number and , , ,&amp;hellip;etc., are entity identification numbers; e.g., grid
point numbers.
Example
Consider the Case Control Section shown below:
CEND
TITLE=OUTPUT SELECTION EXAMPLE
SUBTITLE=ILLUSTRATES USE OF SETS
LOAD=15
SET 1=3,4,7,9,11
SET 5=2,9,15 THRU 21,23
DISP=1
FORCE=1
STRESS=5
BEGIN BULK
DISP is a grid point output quantity, so displacements for grid points 3, 4, 7, 9, and 11 will be printed.
FORCE is an element output quantity, so forces for elements 3, 4, 7, 9, and 11 will be printed. Note that
grid quantities and element quantities can share the same set, since a set is simply a list of numbers. STRESS
is an element quantity, so the stresses in elements 2, 9, 15 through 21 (inclusive), and 23 will be calculated
and printed.SIMPLY SUPPORTED BEAM

&lt;p&gt;Requesting Analysis Results
MSC Nastran output is requested in the Case Control Section. In a small or medium sized analysis, asking
for everything is probably not an issue. In a large problem, output can become overwhelming, and it may be
desirable to be selective. In either case, you have complete control and considerable flexibility in your choice
of output. T wo basic classes of output are available: grid point quantities or element quantities.
Grid Point Output (DISP, SPCF, OLOAD, GPFORCE)
Requests for output  quantities that occur at grid points include the following (n is a SET ID, and ALL
requests that all quantities be printed):
Element Output (STRESS, FORCE, STRAIN, ESE)
Requests for element-based output  quantities include the following:DISPLACEMENT
(Case)=ALL
or
DISP=nRequests displacements for grid points. It is recommended that DISP = ALL  be
used unless you have a good reason for doing otherwise-displacement output
takes up very little space, and you don’t always know a priori what you will be
interested in reviewing.
SPCFORCES (Case)=ALL
or
SPCF=nRequests forces of single point constraint (SPCFORCES). SPCF =ALL should
always be used so that reaction forces can be examined during the model
validation process.
OLOAD (Case)=ALL
or
OLOAD=nRequests the set of applied loads in static analysis.
GPFORCE (Case)=ALL
or
GPFORCE=nThe GPFORCE request generates a table containing a grid point force balance
at the selected grid points. This is useful for determining load paths,
contributions of applied loads to element response, and the effects of initial
thermal strain. Contributors to the grid point force balance table include applied
loads, SPC forces, and element elastic forces.
STRESS  (Case)=ALL
or
STRESS=nRequests element stresses for a set of structural elements.
FORCE (Case)=ALL
or
FORCE=nRequests element forces to be calculated for a set of structural elements.
STRAIN (Case)=ALL
or
STRAIN=nRequests the strains for a set of plate elements.
ESE (Case)=ALL
or
ESE=nRequests the strain energy for a set of elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;189 Chapter 10: Controlling the Analysis Output
Main Index
CQUAD4  stresses, strains, and forces are available at corner grid points, with output at the element center
the default. CQUAD4 center and corner output is obtained using the STRESS, STRAIN, and FORCE Case
Control commands as follows:
STRESS(CORNER) = {ALL or n}
STRAIN(CORNER) = {ALL or n}
FORCE(CORNER) = {ALL or n}
Where { } indicates that a choice of ALL or n is mandatory, but the braces are not included.
Currently, only one type of element output (center or corner) is supported per run. For further information
regarding CQUAD4 corner output, see the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide .&lt;/p&gt;

machine. Six types of basic messages are as follows:
Message Format
The general format of a message is:
where
id: It is a unique message identification number.
text:  It is the message displayed in capital letters for each of the diagnostic messages.
A series of asterisks (****) in the text indicates specific information that will be filled in the message by MSC
Nastran, such as a grid point ID or the name of a Bulk Data entry. Many of the messages are followed by
additional explanatory material, including suggestions for corrective action.
User Messages
User messages are related to the finite element model (e.g., an incorrect input file).
UIM: Describes the general information which may not necessarily refer to a problem.
UWM: Indicates that a typical situation has been detected. You must go through the warning to
determine whether the problem exists or not. UIMs and UWMs can appear throughout the output
file, and the execution of the program continues in a normal manner following the printing of the
message.
UFM: Describes errors that are severe enough which can lead to termination of MSC Nastran. The
UFM usually appears at the end of the MSC Nastran .f06  output file.
SIM/SWM or SFM: These messages are issued when system encounters a logical or operational
condition with its Executive System, DMAP or accessing the Operating System (OS) operations.UIM User Information Message
UWM User Warning Message

System Messages
System Messages refer to diagnostics related to program errors. A short excerpt from the message list is shown
in Figure 11-1.

Epsilon-A Measure of Numerical Behavior
In each MSC Nastran linear static analysis run, a number called Epsilon  is automatically printed in the .f06&lt;br&gt;
output file. Epsilon is based on a strain energy error ratio, and gives an important measure of roundoff error
and numerical ill-conditioning.
A system of linear equations is said to be ill-conditioned if small perturbations in the system lead to large
changes in the solution. MSC Nastran checks for evidence of ill-conditioning in the system of equations
representing the structural model. A high value of Epsilon indicates a potential ill-conditioning problem.
Ill-conditioning does not necessarily result in a fatal error, but it can result in inaccurate answers. Possible
causes of ill-conditioning include a high difference in stiffness between adjacent elements in the model,
unconnected degrees of freedom, rigid body motion, or the presence of mechanisms.
Epsilon should be one of the first items you must examine when reviewing your output file. A small value of
Epsilon does not guarantee a correct solution, but it is certainly a necessary starting point. A large value of
epsilon (greater than about ) indicates numerical ill-conditioning and requires further investigation.MSC Nastran SYSTEM and USER MESSAGES

The possible causes of a large epsilon include the following:
Rigid body motion
The presence of a mechanism
Unreasonably stiff elements
Very large differences in stiffness between adjacent elements
It does not matter whether epsilon is positive or negative, as long as it is small. In addition, a value of, say
is not a better value than ; both are small enough.

Element Distortion and Accuracy
The accuracy of a finite element degrades as its shape is distorted. You will examine distortions associated
with CQUAD4 plate and CHEXA solid elements.
CQUAD4 Plate Element Distortion
There are four basic types of CQUAD4  element distortion :
Aspect ratio
Warp
Skew
Taper
CQUAD4 Aspect Ratio
Aspect ratio is the ratio of the element’s longest side to its adjacent side.

&lt;p&gt;195 Chapter 11: Additional Considerations
Main Index
An element’s aspect ratio  should be less than 4:1, and much less in regions where stress levels change
rapidly. In regions of nearly uniaxial stress fields, larger aspects ratios are acceptable. MSC Nastran does not
perform an aspect ratio check on CQUAD4 elements.
CQUAD4 Warp
Warp  is the extent to which an element deviates from being planar.
Figure 11-4  CQUAD4 Warp
Warp, up to 5% is normally acceptable. MSC Nastran does not check element warp.
CQUAD4 Skew
Skew  is the angle between the lines that join opposite midsides.
Figure 11-5  CQUAD4 Skew
For an element with no skew, . When the skew angle is less than 30 degree, UIM 5491 is shown.
As a general rule, the CQUAD4  element should be kept as square as possible.
CQUAD4 Taper
Taper is the ratio of the areas on the two sides of a diagonal; if the ratio is greater than three, then the taper
test performed by MSC Nastran fails and user information message 5419 is shown. As a rule, taper angles
should not exceed 30 degree in most of the applications.ab

CHEXA Solid Element Distortion
MSC Nastran makes two element geometry checks for CHEXA  elements: aspect ratio and face warping .
These checks are done because, the solution accuracy in regions of nonconstaint stress can degrade if the
element geometry distorts significantly from its ideal cubic shape.
Aspect ratio is the ratio of the length of any two sides. If this ratio is greater than 100, indicating a very
elongated CHEXA  element, then user information message 4655 is shown for that element.
Warping indicates that a face of a CHEXA  is not planar, shown with User Information Message 4656, which
indicates that a face is considerably out of plane. This message is shown if the corner normals at the opposite
corners of a face deviate from each other by more than 45 degree, as shown in Figure 11-7 (midside nodes are
neglected in the calculation).

Defining the Problem
In this chapter, we perform a complete MSC Nastran analysis. Consider the hinged  steel beam shown in
Figure 12-1. It has a rectangular cross section and is subjected to a 100 lb concentrated force. Determine the
deflection and stresses in the beam at the point of application of  the load, with and without the effects of
transverse shear.
Figure 12-1  Beam Geometry and Load
Specifying the Type of Analysis
The type of analysis to be performed is specified in the Executive Control Section of the input file using the
SOL (SOLution) statement. In this problem, we choose Solution 101, which is the linear  static analysis
solution sequence.
The statement required is:
SOL 101&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;201 Chapter 12: Performing Analysis
Main Index
We will also identify the job with an ID statement and set the CPU time limit with a TIME statement  as
follows:
ID MPM,CH 12 EXAMPLE
TIME 100
Both the TIME and ID statements are optional. The default value of TIME, however, is too  small for all but
the most trivial problems.  The format of the ID entry (ID i1,i2) must be adheared to or a fatal error will
result.
The end of the Executive Control Section is indicated by the CEND delimiter. Thus, the complete Executive
Control  Section is written as follows:
ID MPM,CH 12 EXAMPLE
SOL 101
CEND
Designing the Model
The structure is a classical hinged slender beam subjected to bending behavior from a concentrated  load. The
CROD element will not work since it supports only extension and torsion. The CBEAM  element would
work, but its special capabilities are not required for this problem and its property entry  is more difficult to
work with. Thus, the CBAR element is a good choice. The number of elements to  use is always a crucial
decision; in our case the simplicity of the structure and its expected behavior  allows the use of very few
elements. We will choose three CBAR elements and four evenly spaced  grid points as shown in Figure 12-2.
Figure 12-2  The Finite Element Model
Note:   GRID points were located at the point of application of the load and at each reaction point.&lt;/p&gt;

Creating the Model Geometry
Coordinate System
MSC Nastran has a default rectangular coordinate system called the basic system. Therefore, no  special effort
is required to orient our model. We will choose to define the model’s coordinate system as shown in Figure 1-
3. The beam’s element x-axis will be parallel to the basic system’s x-axis by  our choice of X1, X2, and X3 (x,
y, and z) on the GRID entries.
Figure 12-3  Model Coordinate System
GRID Points
GRID  points are defined in the Bulk Data Section of the input file. Recall that the format of the GRID entry is:

&lt;p&gt;203 Chapter 12: Performing Analysis
Main Index
The default basic coordinate system is defined by leaving field 3 (CP) blank (the basic coordinate  system’s ID
number is zero).
The values of X1, X2, and X3 (in our rectangular system these mean x, y, and z) in fields 4, 5,  and 6 are as
follows:
Field 7 (CD) is left blank since we want grid point displacements and constraints to be defined in the  basic
coordinate system. The constraints for this problem could be defined on field 8 (PS) of grid  points 1 and 4.
Instead, we will use SPC1 entries and leave field 8 blank.  Finally, field 9 is left blank since superelements are
not part of this problem.&lt;br&gt;

Defining the Finite Elements
The CBAR Entry
Elements are defined in the Bulk Data Section of the input file. The format of the CBAR simple  beam
element is as follows:
The property identification number (PID) is arbitrarily chosen to be 101—this label points to a PBAR beam
property entry. The same PID is used for each of the three CBAR elements. GA and GB are entered for each
beam element, starting with GA (end A) of CBAR element 1 at (0., 0., 0.). Recall that the direction of the
X-element axis is defined as the direction from GA to GB.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

The beam orientation vector V, described by GA and the components X1, X2, and X3, is arbitrarily chosen
by setting X1 = 0.0, X2 = 1.0, and X3 = 0.0. Orientation vector V is shown in the following figure.
V and xelem defines Plane 1 and the yelem Axis
Plane 1 is thus formed by V and the x-element axis. The y-element axis (yelem) is perpendicular to the x-
element axis and lies in plane 1.
Plane 2 is perpendicular to plane 1, and the z-element axis (zelem) is formed by the cross product of the x-
element and y-element axes.
The completed CBAR entries are written as follows:
Or, in free field format, the CBAR entries appear as:
CBAR,1,101,1,2,0.,1.,0.
CBAR,2,101,2,3,0.,1.,0.

The PBAR Entry
The format of the PBAR entry is as follows:
For our model, the property ID (PID) is 101, as called out on the CBAR entry. The material ID (MID) is&lt;br&gt;
arbitrarily chosen to be 201—this label points to a MAT1 entry. The beam’s cross sectional area A is  entered
in field 4, and the torsional constant J is entered in field 7. The beam has no nonstructural  mass (NSM), so
column 8 is left blank.
Now you will specify I1 and I2 in fields 5 and 6. Recall that the choice of orientation vector V is arbitrary.
What is not arbitrary is getting each value of I to match its correct plane. I1 is the moment  of inertia for
bending in plane 1 (which is the same as bending about the z axis, as it was probably  called in your strength
of materials class).
Similarly, I2 is the moment of inertia for bending in plane 2 (about the y axis). Thus,
, and .
As a check for this model, think of plane 1 in this problem as the stiff plane  (larger value of I) and  plane 2 as
the not-as-stiff plane (smaller value of I).

We will choose the following two points (there is no  requirement that all four available points must be used):
Finally, the problem statement requires that we investigate the effect of shear deflection. To add  shear
deflection to the bar, we include appropriate values of K1 and K2 on the second continuation of  the PBAR
entry. For a rectangular cross section, K1 = K2 = 5/6.
Leaving K1 and K2 blank results in default values of infinity (i.e., transverse shear flexibility is set  equal to
zero). This means that no deflection due to shear will occur.
The completed PBAR entry is written as follows (no shear deflection):
To add shear deflection, a second continuation is added:

Specifying Material Properties
The fields used and their properties are as follows:
The beam’s material is steel, with an elastic modulus of  0 x 106 ib/in. Poisson’s ratio is 0.3. The format of the
MAT1 entry is shown below (we will not use the optional  stress limit/margin of safety capability on the
MAT1 continuation line).
The material identification number called out on the PBAR entry is 201; this goes in field 2 of the  MAT1
entry. Values for RHO, A, TREF , and GE are irrelevant to this problem and are therefore left  blank. Thus,
the MAT1 entry is written as follows:Field Contents Value

Representing Boundary Conditions
The beam is hinged, so we must constrain GRID points 1 and 4 to represent this behavior. We will  use one
SPC1 Bulk Data entry for both grid points since the constraints at each end are the same.
The format of the SPC1entry is as follows:
An SPC set identification number (SID) of 100 is arbitrarily chosen and entered in field 2. T o select  the SPC,
the following Case Control command must be added to the Case Control Section:

Grids 1 and 4 cannot translate in the x, y, or z directions (constrain DOFs 1, 2, and 3). Grids 1  and 4 cannot
rotate about the x-axis or y-axis (constrain DOFs 4 and 5). Grids 1 and 4 can rotate  about the z-axis (leave
DOF 6 unconstrained). Therefore, the required SPC1 entry is written as follows:
Or in free field format we enter:

Applying the Loads
The beam is subjected to a single concentrated force  of 100  acting on GRID 3 in the negative Y direction.
The FORCE  Bulk Data entry is used to apply this load. Its format is described below:
A load set identification number (SID) of 10 is arbitrarily chosen and entered in field 2 of the FORCE  entry.

Controlling the Analysis Output
The types of analysis quantities to be printed are specified in the Case Control Section. This problem requires
displacements and element stresses, so the following commands are needed:
DISP(PLOT)=ALL (to reduce output and time)
DISP=ALL (prints all GRID point displacements)
STRESS=ALL  (prints all element stresses)
In order to help verify the model results, we will also ask for the following output quantities:
FORCE=ALL  (prints all element forces)
SPCF=ALL  (prints all forces of single point constraint; i.e., reaction forces)
The following command will yield both unsorted and sorted input file listings:
ECHO=BOTH
TITLE  and SUBTITLE  headings will appear on each page of the output, and are chosen as follows:
TITLE=HINGED BEAM
SUBTITLE=WITH CONCENTRATED FORCE
Finally, we select constraint and load sets as follows:
SPC=100
LOAD=10
The complete Case Control Section is shown below. The commands can be entered in any order  after the
CEND  delimiter.

ECHO=BOTH
DISP=ALL

Check for Error Messages, Epsilon, and Reasonable Displacements
No error or warning messages are present in the .f06  (results) file—this is certainly no guarantee of  a correct
run, but it’s a good first step. Also, examine the value of epsilon on page 6 of the output.
It is very small  ( ), showing stable numerical behavior. Next, it is a good policy to chec k the&lt;br&gt;
displacement values, just to verify that they are not absurdly out of line with the physical problem or  that a
geometric nonlinear analysis is not required. For example, this beam displacing several inches  might indicate
that a load is orders of magnitude too high, or that a cross sectional property or an  elastic modulus has been
incorrectly specified. In our case, the lateral displacements (page 8 of the  output) are on the of  inches,
which seems reasonable for this problem.
Figure 12-4  Reality Vs Modeling
The MAT1 entry states that our material is always elastic and infinitely strong. In reality, we will violate&lt;br&gt;
restrictions on small displacements and material linearity given sufficient loading.
Check Reactions
To check static equilibrium, we calculate the reaction forces at the constraints and obtain 33.3 lbs. in the +y
direction at grid point 1 and 66.6 lbs. in the +y direction at grid point 4 ( Figure 12-6). These values match the
forces of single point constraint reported on page 10 of the output (T2 in this table means forces in the Y
direction). Thus, the load and resulting reactions make sense.~1016–
103–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;219 Chapter 12: Performing Analysis
Main Index
Check Shear Along the Beam
The shear diagram for the beam is shown in Figure 1-7(b). The output lists the shear forces across  each
element as -33.3 lbs. for elements 1 and 2 and +66.6 lbs. for element 3.
Figure 12-5   Beam Reaction Forces, Shear Diagram, and Moment Diagram
Note:    Shear occurs only in plane 1 (the plane of the applied force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Getting Started Guide 220
Main Index
The sign convention for CBAR  element internal shear forces in Plane 1 (xelem—yelem plane) is shown in the
following figure:
Figure 12-6  CBAR Element Shear Convention (Plane 1)
Thus, the signs make sense with respect to the applied load.
Displacement and Stress Results
The displacement at the point of application of the load (GRID 3) is shown on page 9 of the results:
= -2.221112E-3 inch
The deflection is in the -y direction as expected.
The CBAR element stresses at the point of application of the load (GRID 3) are reported by end b of  CBAR
2 and end a of CBAR 3. Positive stress values indicate tension and negative values indicate  compression. The
top of the beam is in compression and the bottom of the beam is in tension.
Stress recovery point 1 is located on the top of the beam and point 2 is located at the bottom of  the beam, as
shown in the following figure:

Figure 12-7  Bar Element Output Nomenclature
The MSC Nastran CBAR element stress output (Figures 6-7) is interpreted as shown in the following figure.

Therefore, the top surface of the beam (point 1) sees  (compression), and the bottom surface
sees  (tension).

Comparing the Results with Theory
First, the deflection at the point of application of the load will be determined by hand. This calculation  does
not include shear effects, so it can be directly compared with the MSC Nastran results shown in  the MSC
Nastran Output. The deflection due to bending only is calculated as follows:
This value is in exact agreement with the T2 value for GRID 3 on page 8 of the MSC Nastran output.  The
effect of shear deflection is determined by adding the second continuation of the PBAR entry and  rerunning
the job. The new Bulk Data Section is shown in Listing 1-2. See MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/gt12ex1S.dat .
Figure 12-9  Shear Factor K on PBAR Entry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;223 Chapter 12: Performing Analysis
Main Index
Shear Factor K: K1 = K2 = 5/6 = .8333 for rectangular sections
The deflection results are given in the output:
Comparing deflection at GRID 3 with and without shear, we have:
(without shear) = -2.221112E-3 inch
(with shear) = -2.255780E-3 inch
Thus, adding shear to the model results in about 1.6% greater deflection of GRID 3.
The stresses on the top and bottom surfaces of the beam at the point of application of the load are given by
where:
From Figure 12-6(c), the moment at GRID 3 is 666.6 in-lb.  Thus,
which is in agreement with the MSC Nastran results.M =moment at GRID point 3
c =distance from neutral axis to outer fiber

Run MSC Nastran
You can execute MSC Nastran several ways, but the two recommended here are as follows:
1.Direct nastran submission
2.Using a Pre-processor
Patran/MSC Apex
Using nastran Command
MSC Nastran is executed from the command line using the command nast20241 . This command sets
environment variables in order for MSC Nastran to correctly execute on your system and it also has
capabilities to predict memory and solvers (as of MSC Nastran 2024.1 w ith solve=auto ). The basic
format of the nast20241  command is:
nast20241  input_data_file  keywords
nast20241  input_data_file  [keyword1=value1 keyword2=value2 …]
where input_data_file is the name of the file containing the input data and keyword=valuei is one or more
optional keyword assignment arguments. For example, to run an MSC Nastran job using the data file
example1.dat , enter the following command:
nast20241 example1.dat
Various options to the nast20241 command are available using keywords. Keyword assignments consist
of a keyword, following by an equal sign, followed by a keyword value. For example,
nast20241 example1.dat memorymax=16gb
To run Nastran on Linux OS, Korn Shell (ksh) is required to be installed on the system
The details of submitting an MSC Nastran job are specific to your machine. Contact your IT personnel or
refer to the MSC Nastran Installation Guide for further information. Keyword assignment can be specified
in the command line or included in RC files.
The following sets of Run time Configuration (RC) files are controlled by you:
Files that define parameters applicable to all MSC Nastran jobs that you run.
Files that define parameters specific to all MSC Nastran jobs that reside in the input data files
directory. They are located in the same directory as the input data file. If the rcf keyworkd is used,
this local RC file is ignored.
The location and names of these RC files are described in Ap.A: Configuring the Runtime Environment  of
MSC Nastran Installation and Operations Guide.&lt;br&gt;
Using Pre-processor to Execute MSC Nastran
Nastran can be executed using MSC Software’s pre-processor Patran. Do the following steps to execute MSC
Nastran using Patran:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;227 Chapter 13: Executing MSC Nastran

1.Select Analysis  tab and select Entire Model .
The RHS Window  is displayed.
2.In the  RHS Window  select the following:
Action: Analyze
Object: Entire Model
Method: Full Run&lt;br&gt;
3.Click Apply .
This will execute the program in the command window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Getting Started Guide 228
Main Index
4.The command window displays the status of translation.
5.After the problem is executed in Nastran, click Results.
6.Under Results tab, select:
Action: Create
Object: Quick Plot
7.Select Result Cases  and Result Type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;229 Chapter 13: Executing MSC Nastran
Main Index
8.Click Apply to see the results.
Checking the Analysis
Once you submit the Nastran run, multiple files such as log, f04 and f06  gets created in same folder
where your input file is located. These files are helpful to check progress as well as error messages.  All these
files are ASCII files and can be opened in any textpad.
In .log  file, one can check for NSEXIT = EXIT(0) to check if run completed successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Getting Started Guide 230
Main Index
If it exits with other number, there is an error in the analysis, then check .f06 file for FATAL
message.
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interpreting the .f04 File
MSC Nastran writes information to the .f04  file that helps you to examine and tune the performance of
your job. An overview of the complete .f04  file can be found in  Chapter 7: Solution Sequences  of the  MSC Nastran
Reference Guide . This section describes detailed explanations of selected portions of the .f04  file.
The .f04 File Information
This summary table describes the physical files used for the DBsets . A sample of this table, located near the
top of the .f04  file, is shown below.
Note:   If there is a USER FATAL MESSAGE or a SYSTEM FATAL MESSAGE occurrence, then
the job did not complete successfully.&lt;/p&gt;

The above statistical format contains two parallel tables. The LOGICAL DBSETS  table lists each DBset  while
DBSET FILES  tables lists the component files of the  DBset. The description of the files is :
In this example, the MASTER and OBJSCR DBsets are each composed of one file. The MASTER , DBALL&lt;br&gt;

Introduction
MSC Nastran can solve equations of virtually unlimited size—problems have been solved in excess of
10,000,000 degrees of freedom. MSC Nastran solves large systems of equations using sparse matrix
algorithms, resulting in faster solutions and reduced computer storage space. MSC Nastran also takes
advantage of vector processing and parallel processing on computers that support these features, resulting in
faster computations.
In addition to sparse matrix algorithms, MSC Nastran offers numerical algorithms to handle other types of
matrices. In general, the choice of algorithms is made automatically by the program, which selects the fastest
method for solving a given equation based on matrix density, computer speed, and available computer
memory.
Geometric Reduction Methods
The geometric reduction methods are:
Superelement analysis
Axisymmetric analysis
Cyclic symmetry analysis
Superelement  Analysis
Superelement analysis is a special feature of MSC Nastran that can be used to reduce the complexity and
resource demands of large analysis problems. MSC Nastran’s superelement capabilities can be used in all types
of analyses, including statics, normal modes, buckling, transient response, frequency response, heat transfer,
and nonlinear analysis.
Using the superelement technique involves breaking down a large structure into a set of smaller substructures
called superelements. Superelements may be processed individually or all at once. The final solution, in which
all of the individual superelement solutions are combined, involves much smaller matrices than would be
required if the entire model were solved in one run. Superelement analysis has the advantage of reducing
computer resource requirements, especially if changes are made to only one portion (superelement) of the
model—only the affected superelement need be reanalyzed.
Superelement analysis offers procedural advantages as well, particularly when multiple engineering firms are
involved in an analysis. Imagine a model of a rocket and satellite payload: one firm models the space booster,
another firm models the engines, and another models the satellite. Each firm can reduce its model to so-called
boundary degrees of freedom suitable for superelement analysis. The primary analysis firm then combines
these reduced models into one model for a liftoff analysis. Superelement analysis has the advantage that
matrices are passed from one organization to another without revealing proprietary modeling details and
without concern about whether the same grid point and element numbers were used by every participant.&lt;/p&gt;

An example of superelement analysis applied to a car door assembly is shown as follows:
Figure 14-1  Superelements Used to Model a Car Door
As finite element models become larger and more complicated, engineers must take advantage of all tools
available to them. Superelements are one of the most powerful tools available for the analysis of large
problems. By using sound engineering judgement to develop superelement models, MSC Nastran engineers
have been able to obtain performance improvements as large as 29:1 compared to conventional analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Getting Started Guide 238
Main Index
Axisymmetric Analysis
Pressure vessels and other similar containers are often axisymmetric and can be treated as shells of revolution.
MSC Nastran offers several axisymmetric elements for modeling these types of structures. Using
axisymmetric elements, only a small portion of the structure need be modeled, saving considerable
engineering time and computer cost.
Figure 14-2  Axisymmetric Structure
Cyclic Symmetry Analysis
Many structures, including rotating machines and antennas for space structures, are composed of virtually
identical segments that are symmetrically oriented with respect to an axis. These kinds of structures can be
analyzed using cyclic symmetry analysis, which allows the analyst to model only one of the identical segments
and yet obtain results for the entire model. MSC Nastran can analyze structures with rotational symmetry
and with dihedral symmetry, as shown in the Figure 14-3. Cyclic symmetry analysis can be performed for
statics, normal modes, buckling, and frequency response analysis.

&lt;p&gt;239 Chapter 14: Performance Considerations
Main Index
Memory and I/O Performance
Computer system memory (i.e., RAM Memory) is a critical component of the performance of MSC Nastran.
MSC Nastran was designed to run in a minimal memory environment, but nevertheless, insufficient
memory can lead to suboptimal performance. If there is insufficient memory, MSC Nastran stores parts of
the model during the simulation on the disk, which requires reading to and writing from the disk, referred
to as I/O. This increased I/O cost can decrease the performance MSC Nastran.
Default Memory Settings
MSC Nastran can use 4-byte integers by specifying mode=i4  as an optional keyword or 8-byte integers by
specifying mode=i8  as an optional keyword. In MSC Nastran 2014.0, the default is 8-byte integers. For 8-
byte integers, the maximum RAM memory that can be used is virtually unlimited, whereas for 4-byte
integers, the maximum RAM memory available is 8 Gigabytes. A typical laptop can have anywhere from 2
Gigabytes to 16 Gigabytes of RAM memory with high performance computing systems reaching 256
Gigabytes of RAM memory and even up to 1 T erabyte of RAM memory.
MSC Nastran uses 50% of RAM memory for 8-byte integers or the minimum of 50% of RAM memory and
8 Gigabytes for 4-byte integers. You can use a Linux tool like top or a Windows tool like T ask Manager to see
the amount of memory actually used by MSC Nastran for the given simulation. MSC Nastran uses 50% of
computer system memory to leave the other 50% to the system for I/O caching or for standard computer
system processes. MSC Nastran can be used more than 50% of computer system memory various other
methods that are described in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide , referred to as the memorymax&lt;br&gt;
keyword.
I/O Performance
As stated in the previous section, when there is insufficient memory, MSC Nastran uses the disk to store parts
of the model and perform I/O, to allow the user to increase the problem size that they can run on their
computing system. A typical simulation can require a few hundred Megabytes of I/O, or in extreme cases, a
few Terabytes of I/O. A typical Hard Disk Drive (HDD) is defined by the speed at which it spins with typical
amounts being 5400 RPM (Revolutions per Minute) or up to 15,000 RPM.
The faster the disk spins, the faster the computing system can perform I/O operations. For example, a modest
hard drive might read and write at 50 Megabytes per second, whereas a higher end hard drive can read and
write at 100 Megabytes per second. The higher end hard drive can deliver 2x faster performance for the I/O
part of MSC Nastran. A Solid State Device (SSD) is another popular disk storage medium that has higher
read and write speeds. A typical SSD can read and write at 200 Megabytes per second or even as high as 500
Megabytes per second. For MSC Nastran, the higher end SSDs results in faster performance in the typical
simulation.
Buffer Pool Usage
MSC Nastran uses a part of the memory it allocates for buffering I/O. As stated earlier, MSC Nastran is
designed to run large problems that do not fit entirely in memory so I/O is performed to run these large
problems. By leaving some of memory for buffering, we can accelerate the performance of the I/O in MSC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Getting Started Guide 240
Main Index
Nastran and, thus, the overall performance. MSC Nastran has been designed to use the optimal buffer pool
amount by default so you need not change the buffer pool amounts except for large and complex problems.
Further details of buffer pool usage are described in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide .
Parallel Performance
Most modern desktop computers or laptop computers have multi-core CPUs with anywhere from 2 to 16
cores per CPU. However, the typical laptop computer generally has no more than 4 cores available for work.
Each core can be utilized by MSC Nastran to speed-up simulations via the means of parallel processing. If
the algorithm is perfect parallelizable, then 2 cores can reduce the wall time of the simulation by a factor of
2. In practice, this is rarely the case but instead 2 cores may reduce the wall time by anywhere from 25-40%
depending on the model.
In MSC Nastran, there are two ways of obtaining parallelism to accelerate your simulation:
Using Distributed Memory Processing (DMP).
Using Shared Memory Processing (SMP).
These are explained in detail in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide . In this section, we consider SMP
parallelism since we assume that the reader of the Getting Started Guide  is starting with MSC Nastran on a
laptop. It is difficult to get good performance on a laptop with DMP because there are only 4 cores and
generally slower hard drive speeds.
SMP parallelism utilizes parallelization of underlying math kernels to get parallelism. For example, internal
to MSC Nastran sparse matrix calculations, there are a number of large dense matrix operations like matrix-
matrix multiply. For this, it is possible to get very good acceleration using more than one core from the
computing system. You can request more cores by specifying smp=N as an optional keyword, where N is a
number less than the total number of cores on the computing system.&lt;/p&gt;

Beam with a Distributed Load and a Moment
This problem uses the same beam as the problem in Chapter 12: Performing Analysis  (i.e., the GRIDs,
CBAR  elements, and element properties are identical). The loads and constraints have been changed.
Problem Statement
Find the free end deflection of a rectangular cantilever  beam subject to a uniform distributed load and a
concentrated moment at the free end. The beam’s geometry, properties, and loading are shown in Figure 15-1.

Main Index
The Finite Element Model
Applying the Loads
The uniform distributed load is applied to the three CBAR elements using a PLOAD1 entry. One PLOAD1
entry is required for each element. We have chosen fractional scaling, which means that the physical length
of the element is normalized to a length of 1.0. Since the distributed load runs the entire length of each
element, each PLOAD1 entry will be applied from 0.0 to 1.0. Since the load is uniform,
P1=P2=22.0 lb/in.
The concentrated end moment is applied using a MOMENT  entry. The direction of the moment (by the
right-hand rule) is about the +z axis. Thus,
where M is the magnitude of 120.0 in-lb, and  is the vector (0., 0.,1.).
The load set ID is 10, and the loads are selected in the Case Control Section with the Command LOAD = 10.
Applying the Constraints
Grid 1 is fixed in a wall, so all six degrees of freedom (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) are constrained to zero. This can be
done directly on the GRID entry using Field 8 (PS-Permanent Single point constraints associated with the
grid point). No other constraints are required in this model.
Output Requests
The Case Control Command DISP = ALL is required to report displacements. In addition, it is a good idea
to look at constraint forces at the wall, as part of checking out the model. Thus, we will add the Case Control
Command SPCF = ALL.

Reviewing the Results
First, we review the . f06 output file for any warning or error messages. None are present in this file. Next,
look at epsilon on page 7 of the output. Its value of 1.5924801E-15 is indeed very small, showing no evidence
of numerical difficulties. Finally, we review the reaction forces (forces of single point constraint) at the wall.
A free body diagram of the structure is used to solve reaction forces as follows:*** SYSTEM INFORMATION MESSAGE 4159 (DFMSA)

Solving for the reactions at the wall, we obtain:
The SPC forces are listed on page 10 of the MSC Nastran results. The T2 reaction (force at grid point 1 in
the y direction) is +660 lbs. The R3 reaction (moment about the z axis) is +9780 lb. Thus, we can be sure
that the loads were applied correctly, and at least the static equilibrium of the problem makes sense.
The displacement results are shown on page 9 of the .f06  file. All displacements at the wall (GRID 1) are
exactly zero. The free end deflection in the y direction (T2 of GRID 4) is -1.086207E-1 in.
As a final observation, note that there is no axial shortening of the beam as it deflects downward (all T1’s are
exactly zero). This is a consequence of the simplifying small displacement assumptions built into slender
beam theory, and MSC’s beam elements when used in linear analysis. If the load on the beam is such that
large displacement occurs, nonlinear analysis must be used to update the element matrices as the structure
deforms. The shortening terms will then be part of the solution.X

Comparison with Theory
The theoretical solution to this problem is as follows:
Using superposition, the net deflection at free end is given by:
Thus, we are in exact agreement with the MSC Nastran result.
It should be noted that simple beam bending problems such as this give exact answers, even with one element.
This is a very special case (as was the extensional rod example in Overview of MSC Nastran ), and is by no
means typical of real world problems.
Rectangular Plate with a Uniform Pressure Load
Problem Statement

The Finite Element Model
Designing the Model
First, we need to examine the structure to verify that it can reasonably qualify as a thin plate. The thickness
is 1/60 of the next largest dimension (3 inches), which is satisfactory.
Next, we observe by inspection that the maximum deflection, regardless of the actual value, should occur at
the center of the free edge. Thus, it will be helpful to locate a grid point there to recover the maximum
displacement.
As a matter of good practice, we wish to design a model with the fewest elements that can do the job. In our
case, doing the job means good displacement accuracy. The model shown in Figure 15-3 contains 20 GRID
points and 12 CQUAD4 elements, which we hope, will yield reasonable displacement results. If we have
reason to question the accuracy of the solution, we can always rerun the model with a finer mesh.b = 3 in

Figure 15-3  Plate Finite Element Model
Applying the Load
The uniform pressure load is applied to all plate elements using the PLOAD2 entry. Only one PLOAD2 entry
is required by using the “THRU” feature (elements 1 THRU 12). The positive normal to each plate element
(as dictated by the GRID point ordering sequence) is in the negative z axis direction, which is the same
direction as the pressure load. Therefore, the value of pressure in Field 3 of the PLOAD2 entry is positive.
Applying the Constraints
SPC1  entries are used to model the structure’s constraints. The SPC1  entries have a set ID of 10, which is
selected by the Case Control command SPC = 100. The constraints on the structure are shown in Figure 15-4.1 2 3 45 6 7 89 10 11 12

Note:   The out-of-plane rotational degree of freedom 6 is constrained for all grids in the model.
This is a requirement of a CQUAD4 flat plate element and has nothing to do with this
specific problem.
Grids 16 and 20, shared with the fixed edge, are fixed – the greater constraint governs. For
the remaining grids:
Displacements Allowed: Rotation about y-axis (degree of freedom 5)
Displacements Not Allowed: Rotation about x-axis (degree of freedom 4)
Translation in x, y, or z (degrees of freedom 1, 2, 3)
The noncorner grids of the free edge have no additional constraints.

Reviewing the Results
The value of epsilon, listed on page 8 of the output, is small, indicating a numerically well-behaved problem.
A plot of the deformed plate is shown in Figure 15-5. As expected, the maximum displacement (-3.687613E-
3 inches) occurs at grid point 3 in the -T3 direction. This deflection is approximately one-fourteenth the
thickness of the plate, and is therefore a fairly reasonable “small” displacement.
It is also useful to check the applied loads against the reaction forces. We have
which is in agreement with the T3 direction SPCFORCE resultant listed on page 9 of the output. Note that
the SPCFORCE is positive, and the applied load is in the negative z (-T3) direction.*** USER INFORMATION MESSAGE 7310 (VECPRN)

The MSC Nastran result (which includes transverse shear) is 7.4% greater than the theory solution. The
theory solution does not account for transverse shear deflection. Rerunning the model without shear (by
eliminating MID3 in field 7of the PSHELL entry) gives a deflection of
Thus, for this thin plate, adding shear deflection results in less than half a percent difference in the total
deflection.
Gear Tooth with Solid Elements
In this problem we create a very simple CHEXA  solid element model of a gear tooth. In addition,
MSC Nastran’s subcase  feature is used to apply two load cases in a single run.
Problem Statement
Two spur gears are in contact as shown in Figure 15-6. The gears are either aligned or misaligned. In the
aligned case, a distributed load of 600 N/mm exists across the line of contact between two teeth. The line of
contact is located at a radius of 99.6 mm from the gear’s center. In the misaligned case, a concentrated load
of 6000 N acts at a single point of contact at the edge of a tooth. The gear teeth are 10 mm wide and 23.5
mm high (from base to tip). The gear’s material properties are:
Figure 15-6  Spur Gears
The goal is to obtain a rough estimate of a gear tooth’s peak von Mises stress for each load case. von Mises
stress, a commonly used quantity in finite element stress analysis, is given by:Wmax (no shear) 3.673454E-3 in =

The Finite Element Model
A single gear tooth is modeled using two CHEXA solid elements with midside grid points as shown in
Figure 15-7. Midside grid points are useful when the shape of a structure is complex or when bending effects
are important.
Figure 15-7  Finite Element Model of a Single Gear Tooth Meshed with 20-noded CHEXA Elements
Applying the Loads
Subcase 1 represents aligned gear teeth and uses the distributed load shown in Figure 15-8. The total applied
load is given by:
In order to approximate the “contact patch” of mating gear teeth, we distribute the total force of 6000 N
across the line of contact with 150 N two corner grids of each element and 300 N on the nineteen
intermediate grids. A load set identification number of 41 (arbitrarily chosen) is given to the FORCE Bulk

Applying the Constraints
The base of the tooth is assumed to be fixed as shown in Figure 15-7. Consequently, grid points at the bottom
face of the tooth are constrained to zero displacement in their translational degrees of freedom (1, 2, and 3).
Recall that solid elements have only translational degrees of freedom and no rotational degrees of freedom.
Since each grid point starts out with all six degrees of freedom, the remaining “unattached” rotational degrees
of freedom must be constrained to prevent numerical singularities. Thus, all grid points in the model (1
through 7733) are constrained in degrees of freedom 4, 5, and 6. The constraints are applied using SPC1
Bulk Data entries.

Stress Results
First we examine the output for error or warning messages – none are present – and find epsilon, which is
reported for each subcase (page 6 of the output). Epsilon is very small in both cases.
CHEXA stress results are reported at each element’s center and corner grid points. Stresses at midside grid
points are not available. For gear teeth in alignment (subcase 1), the peak von Mises stress is 1.14E3 MPa at
grid point 518 of CHEXA element 153 (page 436 of the output in Listing 15-6). Figure 15-10 shows the overlay
of undeformed and deformed shape with stress contour for subcase 1.  Although the f06 shows 1.14E3 MPa,
Patran shows 1.12E3 MPa due to the averaging method used by Patran during results processing. If the
averaging method is set to ‘None’ the results will match. For misaligned gear teeth (subcase 2), the peak von
Mises stress is 4.17E4 MPa at grid point 518 (page 1357 of the output).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;269 Chapter 15: Example Problems
Main Index
Figure 15-10  Stress and Deformation Contour of Subcase 1
Observe that for both subcases the von Mises stresses differ at grid points shared by two adjacent elements.
Solid element stresses are calculated inside the element and are interpolated in toward the element’s center
and extrapolated outward to its corners. The numerical discrepancy between shared grid points is due to
interpolation and extrapolation differences between adjoining elements in regions where high stress gradients
exists (which is often the case in a model with an inadequate number of elements). This discrepancy between
neighboring element stresses can be reduced by refining the element mesh.
Note that solid elements result in a considerable volume of printed output. If printed output is desired for
larger solid element models, you may want to be somewhat selective in requesting output using the Case
Control Section of the input file.

DConstraint The enforcement of a particular displacement (translation and/or
rotation) on a grid point or points. The boundary conditions of a static
structure typically require a zero displacement constraint on various
degrees of freedom in the model. Constraints may also be defined in
terms displacement with respect to other degrees of freedom in the
model or in terms of an enforced nonzero value of displacement.
Continuation An extension of a Bulk Data entry when the entry requires more than
80 columns of input data. Continuations may or may not be required

Decomposition The first step in solving a large system of linear equations,
decomposition breaks the stiffness matrix [K] into lower and upper
triangular factors. This process is one of the most computationally
time-consuming steps in linear static analysis.
Degree(s) of Freedom In linear static analysis, each grid point can undergo at most three
orthogonal translational and three orthogonal rotational
components of displacement. Each component is called a degree of
freedom and adds one unknown to the system of simultaneous
linear equations representing the structure.
Delimiter An entry in the MSC Nastran input (. dat) file which indicates the

EDiscretization The basic process of finite element modeling wherein a continuous
structure is broken up (discretized) into an assembly of individual
elements. The goal is to choose types and quantities of elements
such that the mathematical behavior of the model faithfully
represents the behavior of the structure. Properly discretizing the
structure requires knowledge of the structure and engineering
judgement.
Displacement Coordinate System Each grid point has a displacement coordinate system, as selected
in field 7 of the GRID  Bulk Data entry. Displacements, constraints,
and other grid point-based quantities are determined and reported
based on this coordinate system. The basic coordinate system is
MSC Nastran’s default displacement coordinate system.
Displacement Method A method of structural analysis in which displacements are the
unknown quantities to be determined. MSC Nastran uses the
Displacement Method.

MIll-conditioning A system of linear equations is said to be ill-conditioned if small
perturbations in the system lead to large changes in the solution. MSC
Nastran checks for evidence of ill-conditioning in the system of equations
representing the structural model. A high value of epsilon indicates a
potential ill-conditioning problem. Ill -conditioning does not necessarily
result in a fatal error, but can result in inaccurate answers. Possible causes of
ill-conditioning include a high difference in stiffness between adjacent
elements in the model, unconnected degrees of freedom, rigid body motion,
or the presence of mechanisms. See also Epsilon .

Results File .f06 File .
Rigid Body Motion Rigid body motion occurs when the structural model is free to displace in one or
more directions (displacement without strain). A simple example of rigid body
motion occurs when you move a pencil from one location on your desk to another.
No strain occurs in the pencil – only translation and rotation as a rigid body. In
static analysis, the possibility of rigid body motion due to an insufficiently
constrained structure results in a singularity in the stiffness matrix. Consequently,
the solution of the problem fails during decomposition of the stiffness matrix.
Rigid Element The name “rigid” element is somewhat misleading – the so-called “R” – type
elements are actually constraint elements and do not add additional physical
stiffness to the model. For example, the RBE2 element described in this book
simulates a rigid bar by mathematically linking the displacements of the connected
grid points.

Rotation Displacement about a coordinate axis. A grid point has three rotational degrees of

Shared Memory Processing
Single Point Constraint The constraint of one or more degrees of freedom at a grid point,
thereby enforcing displacement (often zero displacement) of the grid
point in the affected component directions. For example, the grid
point at the fixed end of a cantilever beam is constrained (SPC’d) in
all six degrees of freedom. Reaction forces, called forces of single point
constraint (SPCF), are recovered at these grid points.
Singularity A mathematical condition prohibiting matrix inversion.
Consequently, the system of equations representing the structure
cannot be solved. Common sources of singularities in linear static
analysis include the presence of unconnected (to structural stiffness)
or very weakly connected degrees of freedom, or an inadequate
prescription of constraints on the model resulting in rigid body
motion.
Slowly AppliedmLoads A basic assumption of static analysis: loads must be sufficiently “slowly
applied” so as to cause no significant dynamic effects.
Small Displacements A requirement of linear structural analysis. Displacements must be
sufficiently small so as not to violate certain mathematical
assumptions inherent in the design of the finite elements used. Large
displacements require nonlinear solution methods.
Small Field Format  Input format for Bulk Data entries in which data fields are eight

USpring Element Elements representing simple single degree of freedom extensional or
rotational springs. Also called a zero-dimensional elements or scalar
elements. The CELASi family of elements are spring elements.
Static In the MSC Nastran sense, static means that the structural model is
constrained to prevent rigid body motion (static equilibrium exists)
and that loads are assumed to be “slowly applied,” thereby inducing no
dynamic effects.
Stiffness Matrix Global Stiffness Matrix  and Elemental Stiffness Matrix .
Subcase Subcases allow multiple individual load cases to be analyzed in the
same MSC Nastran run, thereby achieving greater computational
efficiency than with separate runs (the stiffness matrix is only

curved). Also called two-dimensional elements. Popular MSC Nastran
surface elements include the CTRIA3 triangular and CQUAD4
quadrilateral elements.

symmetry. Structural symmetry can be exploited to produce a smaller
model (appropriate constraints are used to model the boundary
conditions on the axis or axes of symmetry).

Introduction to MSC Nastran
MSC Nastran is a structural analysis application used by engineers to perform static, dynamic, and thermal
analysis across the linear and nonlinear domains. It has High Performance Computing (HPC) capabilities
and can take advantage of shared memory and distributed memory parallelism.
MSC Nastran addresses a wide range of engineering problem solving requirements (i.e. beam versus plate
structures and various types of response such as statics or dynamics) as compared to specialty programs, which
concentrate on particular types of analysis. It is used extensively by aerospace, automobile, energy,
biomedical, and other industries.
MSC Nastran allows engineers to virtualize physical prototypes and simulate their structural behavior when
subjected to real world loading events. Engineers use MSC Nastran to compliment and drive product
development. The reasons for selecting MSC Nastran are as follows:
Accuracy and reliability
Reduction in the number of expensive physical prototypes
Rapid consideration of what if scenarios
Have virtual prototype early in the design process, saving costs traditionally associated with physical
prototyping
Remedy of structural issues that may occur during a product’s service, reducing downtime and costs
Optimized performance of existing designs and unique product differentiations leading to industry
advantages over competitors.
The clients of Hexagon either lease or purchase executable-only versions of the program. MSC Nastran is
available on both Windows and Linux. Regardless of the machine used, MSC Nastran is optimized to run
efficiently and provide equivalent results on every system. The MSC Nastran program has evolved over many
versions. Each new version contains significant enhancements in analysis capability and numerical
performance. In addition, many errors from previous versions are corrected.
MSC Nastran is mainly written in Fortran with scattered usage of C and C++ and contains over one million
lines of code. It is composed of a large number of building blocks called modules. A module is a collection of
Fortran subroutines designed to perform a specific task-processing model geometry, assembling matrices,
applying constraints, solving matrix problems, calculating output quantities, conversing with the database,
printing the solution, and so on. The modules are controlled by an internal language called the Direct Matrix
Abstraction Program (DMAP).
Each type of analysis available in MSC Nastran is called a solution sequence, and each solution sequence is a
pre-packaged collection of hundreds or thousands of DMAP commands. Once a solution sequence is chosen,
its particular set of DMAP commands sends instructions to the modules that are needed to perform the
requested solution. All of this happens automatically with no effort from you, except in choosing a solution
sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21 CHAPTER 1

Working With MSC Nastran
It is recommended that MSC APEX or Patran be used as pre-processor for creating the model and post
processor for viewing the results.  Developing a finite element model manually is a time consuming, tedious,
and error-prone activity. Making sense of a large stack of finite element computer output which can easily
contain millions of individual numbers in a medium size problem is also a considerable challenge.
Hence, we use the following:
1.Pre-processor: It is primarily designed to aid in the development of a finite element model. Pre-
processing software also helps the analyst modify the original model if results show that changes and
subsequent reanalysis are required. The pre-processors are able to import geometric data from solid
modeling, computer-aided design (CAD), or computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) software to be
used as a basis for the FEM.
2.Post-processor: It is used to aid in the display and interpre tation of analysis results.&lt;br&gt;
We offer graphics-based software packages, MSC Patran and MSC Apex as the pre-processor and post-
processor .
Refer to the  Figure 1-1 for the functionality of pre- and postprocessors in finite element analysis.
Figure 1-1  Pre- and Postprocessors in FEA
Workflow of MSC Nastran with Patran
Patran is a pre/post-processing software for FEA, providing solid modeling, meshing, analysis setup and post-
processing for multiple solvers  such as MSC Nastran, Dytran, Marc, Abaqus and LSDYNA-3D. P atran
provides a rich set of tools that streamline the creation of  analysis-ready models for linear, nonlinear, explicit
dynamics, thermal, and other finite element solutions.
From geometry cleanup tools that make it easy for engineers to deal with gaps and slivers in CAD, to solid
modeling tools that enable creation of models from scratch, Patran makes it easy for anyone to create FE
models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Getting Started Guide 22
Main Index
Meshes are easily created on surfaces and solids alike using fully automated meshing routines, manual
methods that provide more control, or combinations of both. Finally, loads, boundary conditions, and
analysis setup for most popular FE solvers is built in, minimizing the need to edit input decks.
Patran has the ability to display, sort, combine, scale, and query in a general way a single results database.
Figure 1-2  Patran and MSC Nastran Workflow and Files
Pre-processor
The job of the pre-processor is to create the model and prepare the geometry and the mesh. It also defines
the properties, materials, loads, and the boundary conditions. Then, a text file which includes all these data
under a specific standard format is generated and submitted for analysis .
Patran lets you manage and carry out several phases of the FEA process  in one place. It is a product design
model builder, an environment simulator, a finite element analysis manager, and a numerical results
interpreter all in one.
As a preprocessor, Patran does the following:
Simulates a Product Design:  The finite element m odel must describe the shape and size of the&lt;br&gt;
product, describe what materials are used to construct the product, stipulate how the product is&lt;br&gt;
assembled, and define the environmental forces that the product endures. The majority of the  tools
in Patran help you construct this product design model.
Converts Product Designs into Geometry Models: Patran provides its own set of tools for geometry
creation and editing, using which you can quickly create parts with 2D and 3D wireframe, surface,
and solid geometry. The CAD interface in Patran also allows you to import and edit CAD data from
many leading CAD programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;23 CHAPTER 1
Overview of MSC Nastran
Main Index
Meshing and Creating Elements:  After importing/creating the geometry, you can create and verify
the FEM using a suite of meshing tools—automeshers for curves, surfaces, and solids, as well as
mapped meshing and paved surface meshing.
Modeling Materials:  You can define the materials for analysis in the Materials application in Patran.
A material model is a group of material properties that describe what your model is made of (such as
steel or a composite) and the attributes of that material (stiffness, density, and so on). After defining
the materials for your model, assign them to model regions.
Simulating Forces and Loads: The FEA tests a particular model’s reaction to certain loads and
constraints imposed as boundary conditions. Loads are environmental factors such as force,
pressure, temperature, and voltage. Boundary conditions are described in terms of degrees-of-
freedom, that are the directions in which the edges of the model are free to move in 3D space, along
a translational (straight-line) or a rotational path.
Analyzing the Model with Environmental Loads:  The analysis stage of the simulation project
begins after the product design model phase. You can run a finite element analysis using Patran. You
may need to complete several tasks in Patran to format and setup the analysis.
Selecting an Analysis Code:  Select an analysis code when you begin each simulation project. Patran
assumes that you are using a single analysis code. As you build the product design model, Patran
stores the information using the formats and naming conventions of the analysis code. You can
change the analysis code at any time during the project. When you do so, Patran attempts to convert
all of the data into the new format.
Tailoring the Model for a Selected Analysis Code : You need to define element types (such as beam,
shell, etc) and element-related properties for regions of your model, then assign these definitions to
geometric or FEM entities. Element type selection is based on the finite element code, the
dimensions of the model, and your assumptions about the model’s behavior. Additional properties
describe attributes such as the thickness of a plate, the spring constant for a spring, an area for a bar
element, materials, and so on.
Running FEA : The analysis application provides the link between the Patran environment and the
analysis solvers. The analysis application provides the means to:
•Identify a desired analysis type
•Define translation and solution parameters
•Select a sequence of load cases
•Select desired output
•Send the model data to the analysis solver
•Read result quantities from results files
Compiling the Analysis Results : Finite element results generated in the second step of the solver
stage shown in the Figure 1-2 generally take the form of numbers such as the amount of displacement
at a point in the model with result interpretation and insight post processors such as Patran and
MSC Apex are invaluable. However, it is difficult to gain a real understanding of how a model
behaves by looking at a stack of numbers on paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Getting Started Guide 24
Main Index
Solver
The job of the solver (here, MSC Nastran) is to do the following:
Take the input data from the pre-processor
Process the data using specific algorithms
Give an output that corresponds to the result of the analysis.
After successful execution of the job, different files are automatically created. The table below lists some of
the files that are created after the execution of the job.
Post-processing
Visualizing Numerical Results
After execution, analysis results are loaded directly into the Patran relational database and sorted by time step,
frequency, temperature, or spatial location. Patran has the ability to visualize results using computer graphics,
animation, and other results tools.
The data from the solver (MSC Nastran) is then sent back to the post-processor (Patran) which opens the
files and displays the data in a form that will be understandable for the user (contours, graphs, tables, etc.).
The Patran results application gives users control of powerful graphical capabilities to display results
quantities in a variety of ways. The results application treats all results quantities in a very flexible and general
manner. For maximum flexibility, results can be sorted, reported, scaled, combined, filtered, derived, or
deleted.

Main Index
Refer to Figure 1-3 for the MSC Apex a nd MSC Nastran workflow and files :
Figure 1-3  MSC Apex a nd MSC Nastran Workflow and Files
The FEA process is completed in three stages with MSC Apex:
1.Pre-processing : This is the first stage where you create the model with all its properties. After creating
the entire model you create a Nastran job and export the file to a defined location. Creating a Nastran
job adds all the elements and properties in a file called as the input file/deck (which is understood by
Nastran).
2.Solver : After the input file (. bdf) is generated by the MSC Apex, there are two ways to execute the
problem. One is by clicking Run Option in MSC Apex,  and second way is by externally running
Nastran. According to the input values provided, the solver (Nastran) generates result files and output
files.
3.Post-processing:  The generated output files are then attached to the model using MSC Apex U I.
Capabilities of MSC Nastran
MSC Nastran uses FEA to solve static and dynamic problems. The numerical method comes in two types,
both included in MSC Nastran
Linear FEA
Nonlinear FEA
The nonlinear FEA type can be solved in one of two ways: implicit or explicit. More specific capabilities that
are provided with MSC Nastran are aero-elasticity, thermal analysis, and fatigue life problems. In addition,
MSC Nastran provides a number of methods to use in achieving an optimal design based on the user&amp;rsquo;s chosen
criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

Linear Analysis
A linear static analysis is an analysis where there is a linear relation between applied forces and displacements.
In practice, this is applicable to structural problems where stresses remain in the linear elastic range of the
used material. In this case, the response of the structure (deformation, stress  and strain) is linearly
proportional to the magnitude of the load (force, pressure, moment, torque , temperature , etc.). In short,
linear analysis does not consider any change in stiffness matrix.

The Elemental Stiffness Matrix
An element  stiffness matrix [ k] relates loads acting on an element to displacements resulting from the loads.
We will d erive the stiffness m atrix of the simplest possible element, an extensional elastic rod. Consider an Formulate element stiffness matrices from element
properties, geometry, and material properties.

elastic rod of uniform cross-sectional area A and length L connecting grid points 1 and 2, as shown in
Figure 2-3. The rod is subjected to end loads (cross-sectional loads) and is in static equilibrium.

Axial translations  and  are the only permitted displacements at grid points 1 and 2. Thus, this element
is said to have two degrees of freedom.
Relate Force to Displacement
Our goal is to find an equation relating force to displacement for each degree of freedom. For static
equilibrium, summing element forces in the x direction requires

Assume that the rod changes length by an amount  due to the axial load. Strain in the rod  can be related
to displacement by the definition of simple strain:
(2-2)
We assume that the material of the rod is homogeneous (has the same elastic properties at all points), isotropic
(has the same elastic properties in all directions at any given point in the body), and linear. For such a material,
axial strain  is related to axial stress  by
(2-3)
where  is the modulus of elasticity of the material. By definition, axial (normal) stress is given by axial force

is the individual rod’s stiffness matrix and equation (2-8) is the basic element equation generated and used
in the solution process by MSC Nastran in linear static analysis.
Each type of element has its own elemental stiffness matrix. Stiffness matrices for more complex elements
(general beams, plates, and solids) are determined using procedures based on energy principles.
The Global Stiffness Matrix
A structure is modeled as a collection of individual finite elements. An assembly of elemental stiffness
matrices representing the structure is called a global stiffness matrix . This relationship is illustrated in
Figure 2-4.

Of course, this structural system will need to be constrained. For some structural systems there are thousands
of linear equations that need to be solved simultaneously.
Assumptions for Linear Static Analysis
All loads are applied gradually and slowly until they reach their full magnitude
After reaching full magnitude the loads remain constant
Inertial and damping forces to small velocities and accelerations are neglected
You can make linearity assumption only in the following conditions:
All material in the model comply with Hooke’s Law
The induced displacements are so small that they cause negligible change in the geometric and
material properties and hence the stiffness
The structure subjected to loading has negligibly small accelerations and velocities
The boundary conditions doesn’t change during loading.
Dynamic Analysis
Dynamic analysis  involves loads and responses that vary with time. Common forms of dynamic excitation
include earthquakes, vibrations due to rotating machinery, and structural impact. MSC Nastran deals with a
range of capabilities for dynamic analysis which are classified as follows:F ku =&lt;/p&gt;

Normal Modes Analysis
Normal modes analysis determines the natural frequencies and mode shapes of a structure. The natural
frequencies of a structure are the frequencies at which the structure naturally tends to vibrate if subjected to
any disturbance. For example, the strings of a piano which are each tuned to vibrate at a specific frequency.
Other forms for natural frequency include the following:
Characteristic frequency
Fundamental frequency
Resonance frequency
Normal frequency
The deformed shape of a structure vibrating at a specific n atural frequency is called its normal mode of
vibration, or mode shape. Each mode shape is associated with a specific natural frequency. Finite element
model plots of the first four mode shapes of a cantilever beam are shown in the Figure 2-6DYNAMIC ANALYSIS

Frequency Response Analysis
Frequency response analysis method measures structural response to a steady-state oscillatory excitation. For
example, an equipment which rotates at a set frequency but has an imbalance. In a frequency response
analysis, the excitation is clearly defined in the frequency domain, and all of the applied forces are known at
each forcing frequency.
The results obtained from a frequency response analysis consists of:
Grid point displacements, velocities and accelerations
Element forces and stresses
The measured responses are complex numbers. These are represented in terms of magnitude and phase or
real and imaginary components . For example, Figure 2-7 shows the displacement magnitude of a grid point
vs. frequency.
Figure 2-7  Frequency and Response AnalysisNote:   Forces can be in the form of applied forces and/or enforced motions (displacements, velocities,
or accelerations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Getting Started Guide 40
Main Index
T wo different numerical methods can be used in frequency response analysis, which are described as follows:
Direct frequency response analysis: solves the coupled equations of motion in terms of forcing
frequency.
 Modal frequency response analysis: uses the normal modes of the structure to uncouple the
equations of motion, with the solution for a particular forcing frequency obtained through the
summation of the individual modal responses.
Transient Response Analysis
T ransient response analysis is the most general method for computing forced dynamic response. The purpose
of a transient response analysis is to determine the behavior of a structure subjected to time-varying
excitation. The transient excitation is explicitly defined in the time domain. The displacement response of a
grid point versus time is shown in Figure 2-8.
Figure 2-8  Displacement Response from Transient Response Analysis
T wo different numerical methods can be used for a transient response analysis which depends on the
structure and the nature of the loading, which are as follows:
Direct transient response analysis: Performs a numerical integration of the complete coupled
equations of motion.
Modal transient response analysis: This analysis uses the normal modes of the structure to uncouple
the equations of motion with the solution obtained through the summation of the individual modal
responses.&lt;/p&gt;

Complex Eigen analysis
Complex Eigenanalysis calculates the damped modes of structures, to assess the stability of systems modeled
with transfer functions (including servomechanisms and rotating systems).
The governing equation is similar to normal modes a nalysis except when the damping has been added . In
addition, the mass and stiffness matrices may be unsymmetric, and they can consist of complex elements.
Response Spectrum Analysis
Response spectrum analysis (RSA) is a linear-dynamic statistical analysis method which measures the
contribution from each natural mode of vibration to indicate the likely maximum seismic response of an
essentially elastic structure.
Response-spectrum analysis provides insight into dynamic behavior by measuring pseudo-spectral
acceleration, velocity, or displacement as a function of structural period for a given time history and level of
damping. It is practical to envelope response spectra such that a smooth curve represents the peak response
for each realization of structural period.
Response-spectrum analysis is useful for design decision-making because it relates structural type-selection
to dynamic performance. Structures of shorter period experience greater acceleration, whereas those of longer
period experience greater displacement. Structural performance objectives should be taken into account
during preliminary design and response-spectrum analysis.
From a response spectrum, when you assume that the structure behaves linearly, it is possible to determine
the peak response of each structural mode exactly. Having done that, it is possible to combine the mode
responses approximately (not exactly because this is not a transient analysis) with the use of such methods as
Square Root of the Sum of the Squares (SRSS), sum of absolute values, or Naval Research Laboratory (NRL ).
In addition to response spectrum analysis, MSC Nastran can also compute the following types of response
spectra:
Absolute and relative displacement
Absolute and relative velocity
Absolute acceleration
Component Mode Synthesis
Component Mode Synthesis (CMS) is a form of superelement reduction wherein the matrices are cast in
terms of modal coordinates (resonant frequencies, normal modes, modal mass, stiffness, and damping) in
addition to physical coordinates. CMS has the advantage that there are fewer modal coordinates than
physical coordinates, perhaps only one-tenth as many. In addition, CMS can utilize modal test data, thereby
increasing the accuracy of the overall analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

Random Vibration Analysis
This analysis enables you to determine the response of structures to vibration loads that are random in nature.
An example would be the response of a sensitive electronic component mounted in a car subjected to the
vibration from the engine, pavement roughness, and acoustic pressure.
A few examples of random  vibration include the following:
Aerospace and electronic packaging components subject to engine vibration
Turbulence and acoustic pressures
Tall buildings under wind load
Structures subject to earthquakes
Ocean wave loading on offshore structures
The above random excitations are usually described in terms of a Power Spectral Density (PSD) function.
Random response output consists of the following:
Response power spectral density
Autocorrelation functions
Number of zero crossings with positive slope per unit time
Root Mean Square (RMS) values of response
Nonlinear Analysis
Nonlinear analysis becomes necessary when the stiffness of the part changes under its operating conditions.
All physical processes are inherently nonlinear to a certain extent. For example, when you stretch a rubber
band, it gets harder to pull as the deflection increases; or when you flex a paper clip, permanent deformation
is achieved. Several common every day applications like these exhibit either large deformations and/or
inelastic material behavior. Failure to account for nonlinear behavior can lead to product failures, safety issues,
and unnecessary cost to product manufacturers.
Nonlinear response could be caused by any of several characteristics of a system, like large deformations and
strains, material behavior or the effect of contact or other boundary condition nonlinearities. In reality many
structures exhibit combinations of these various nonlinearities.
Hexagon provides solutions to help you simulate nonlinear systems with applications in variety of industries .

The following table gives you a basic understanding on when to consider nonlinear analysis:
Linear static problems are solved in one step - a single decomposition of the stiffness matrix. Structures whose
stiffness is dependent on the displacement which they may undergo are termed geometrically nonlinear.
Geometric nonlinearity accounts for phenomena such as the stiffening of a loaded clamped plate, and
buckling or &amp;lsquo;snap-through&amp;rsquo; behavior in slender structures or components.
The nonlinear behavior occurs as stiffness and loads become functions of displacement or deformation
K(u){U}=F(u) , both the structural stiffness matrix [K] and possibly the load vector {F} becomes
functions of the displacements {D}. Hence, it is not possible to solve immediately {D} as in the case of
[K]and{F} .
Nonlinear problems of any type require iterative solution methods and incremental loading to get (converge
to) a solution, and are generally far more computationally difficult than linear problems. Nonlinear problems
are classified into four broad categories listed below :Shape memory alloys Pyrolysis and abrasion

MSC Nastran can also handle nonlinear problems that are time dependent (transient). For more information,
refer to the Nonlinear User’s Guide SOL 400  or the MSC Nastran Explicit Nonlinear (SOL 700) User’s Guide .
Material Nonlinearity
Linear analysis assumes a linear relationship between stress and strain. Material nonlinearity results from the
nonlinear relationship between stress and strain. In addition, large strain can influence the material behavior.
Material nonlinearity is associated with the inelastic behavior of a component or system. Inelastic behavior
may be characterized by a forc e-deformation (F-D) relationship which  measures strength against translational
or rotational deformation.
The general F-D relationship shown below i ndicates that once a structure achieves its yield strength,
additional loading will cause the response  to deviate from the initial tangent stiffness (elastic behavior).
Nonlinear response may then increase (hardening) to an ultimate point before degrading (softening) to a
residual strength value.
Nonlinear stress-strain relationships are a common cause of nonlinear structural behavior. For any material
besides steel, reviewing the stress-strain curves is the best way to understand the nonlinearity of the problem.
Even if you use a linear material model, knowing the nonlinearity is important for interpreting results.
Many factors can influence the stress-strain properties of a material, including the following:
Load history (as in elasto-plastic response)
Environmental conditions (such as temperature)
The amount of time that a load is applied (as in creep response).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;45 Chapter 2: MSC Nastran Capabilities
Main Index
Figure 2-9  Material Nonlinearity in Different Types of Materials
Examples of material nonlinearities include metal plasticity, materials such as soils and concrete, or rubbery
materials (where the stress-strain relationship is nonlinear elastic). Various plasticity theories such as von
Mises or T resca (for metals), and Mohr-Coulomb or Drucker-Prager (for frictional materials such as soils or
concrete) can be selected by you. Three choices for the definition of subsequent yield surfaces are available
in SOL 400 as follows:
Isotropic hardening
Kinematic hardening or combined isotropic
Kinematic hardening
Most plastic material behavior, with or without the Bauschinger effect, can be modeled.
Geometric Nonlinearity
Structures whose stiffness is dependent on the displacement which they may undergo are termed
geometrically nonlinear. Geometric nonlinearity accounts for phenomena such as the stiffening of a loaded
clamped plate, and buckling or snap-through behavior in slender structures or components.
In some e ngineering problems, the deformations are so small that the deviation from the original geometry
is not perceptible. The small error introduced by ignoring the deformations does not guarantee the added 

&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Getting Started Guide 46
Main Index
mathematical complexity generated by a more sophisticated theory. This is the reason behind a vast majority
of analyses which are made with an assumption of geometric linearity.
In a geometry nonlinear solution, deflections of the structure are large when compared with the original
dimensions of the structure. Changes in stiffness and loads occur as the structure deforms. In a geometric
nonlinear problem, you can simulate the following:
Large deflections
Deflection-dependent loads
Deflection-dependent stiffness
Geometric nonlinearity is a result of the nonlinear relationship between strain and displacement on the one
hand and the nonlinear relation between stresses and forces on the other hand.
If the stress measure is conjugate to the strain measure, both sources of nonlinearity have the same form. This
type of nonlinearity is mathematically well defined, but often difficult to treat numerically.
If a structure experiences large deformations, its changing geometric configuration can cause the structure to
respond nonlinearly. An example would be the fishing rod shown in Figure 2-10. Geometric nonlinearity is
characterized by large displacements and/or rotations.
Figure 2-10  Example of Nonlinearity
Three important types of geometric nonlinearity occur:
Problems where large rotation occur
The analysis of buckling and snap-through problems (see the figures below)
Large strain problems such as manufacturing, crash, and impact problems. In such problems, due to
large strain kinematics, the mathematical separation into geometric and material nonlinearity is not
unique&lt;/p&gt;

Nonlinear Boundary Conditions
A model exhibits boundary nonlinearity when the loads, constraints, or load paths change throughout the
solution. If the orientation, distribution, or magnitude of applied loads or the load path changes as loading
is increased, a nonlinear model may be required.
Conservative, as in the case of a centrifugal force field
Figure 2-13  Centrifugal Load Problem (Conservative)
Non conservative, as in the case of a follower force on a cantilever beam (the following figure)
Figure 2-14  Follower Force Problem (Non conservative)PP&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;49 Chapter 2: MSC Nastran Capabilities
Main Index
 Locally nonconservative, but represent a conservative loading system when integrated over the
structure. A pressurized cylinder is an example of this.
Figure 2-15  Pressurized Cylinder (Globally Conservative)
Loads on a structure cause nonlinearity if they vary with the displacements of the structure. If there is a
change in constraints due to contact during loading, the problem may be classified as a boundary nonlinear
problem and would require the use of BCTABLE / BCTABLE1 , BCONECT , BCONPRG , BCONPRP ,
BCBODY , or BSURF  bulk data entry options. CGAP  elements would have been used in the traditional
nonlinear sequences of SOL 106 or 129; however, the use of GAP elements is not recommended in SOL 400.
The most common boundary nonlinearities are:
Contact
Contact conditions model the interaction of two separate parts or different surfaces on the same part.
Boundary conditions such as surface contact are generally regarded as nonlinear. However, MSC Nastran
allows a contact analysis to run in a linear solution sequence. I n deciding between a linear and nonlinear
contact analysis it is best to ask these questions:
Are there large movements in the model or any of the other nonlinear effects mentioned above?
Is there significant sliding between contact bodies in the model? Is the contact solution path
dependent (for instance a snap-fit)?
Are detailed contact stresses needed in the model?
If the answer is yes to any of the three questions above, it is generally recommended to run a nonlinear
solution to get the best accuracy.
Follower forces
This nonlinear effect simply means that the direction of the forces move with the deformations or movement
of the part. Pressure loads are a perfect example of follower forces since they always act normal to a surface.
As a part deforms, follower forces will adjust the direction of the loads to ensure they stay normal to the
surface.&lt;/p&gt;

Figure 2-16  Contact and Friction Problem
Nonlinear Transient Analysis
Nonlinear transient analysis should be used if the effects of inertia, damping, and transient loading are
significant. Additionally, quasi-static models that undergo buckling or other instable loading conditions will
often converge better in a nonlinear transient analysis due to the inertia effects keeping the model stable.
A nonlinear transient analysis requires both dynamic and nonlinear setup steps.
Design Sensitivity and Optimization
Design sensitivity and optimization  are used when you modify a design whose level of structural complexity
exceeds our ability to make appropriate design changes. The goal of design optimization is to automate the
design process by using a rational, mathematical approach to yield improved designs. Possible applications
include:
Reducing the weight of a structure.
Producing more efficient designs having maximum margins of safety.
Performing trade-off or feasibility studies.
Assisting in design sensitivity studies.
Correlating test data and analysis results.
Design sensitivity and optimization are closely related topics. In fact, the class of optimizers used in MSC
Nastran require sensitivity analysis results to perform design optimization. An optimizer is an algorithm, or
plan, for searching for a best configuration. Defining what characteristics this configuration might possess is
part of the challenge for the design engineer. Sensitivity analysis is the procedure that determines the changes
in some structural response quantity for an infinitesimal change in a design parameter. These derivatives,
called sensitivity coefficients, may yield useful design information alone, but are of greatest utility if used by
a numerical optimization algorithm to suggest possible design alternatives.
Application Examples
As a simple example of design optimization, consider the cantilevered I-beam shown below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;51 Chapter 2: MSC Nastran Capabilities
Main Index
Figure 2-17  Design Optimization in Cantilevered I-Beam
A frequent task of the designer is to minimize the total structural weight (thereby reducing the cost of
materials) while making sure that the design still satisfies all of the performance-related constraints. The
structural weight is termed the design objective function, and the optimizer will be used to find a minimum
of this function. With the tip load shown in the figure, one constraint on the design might be transverse
displacement at the tip, while other constraints might be placed on natural frequencies. These performance
constraints are called design constraints, since they place limits on the optimizer’s ability to reduce the weight
of the structure.
In order to reduce the weight of this structure, the designer might allow the cross-sectional dimensions to
vary. These design variables may include any or all of the width (w), height (h), thickness of the web ( ),
and thickness of the flanges ( ). However, for analyses, the corresponding cross-sectional properties (A, I1,
I2, and so on) must be determined. Thus, it is up to the designer to specify the dependence of these properties
on the chosen set of design variables. This process, in addition to specification of the design objective and
constraints, is known as design modeling. The design model is simply a statement of the objective,
constraints, and admissible variations which can be made to the structure in pursuit of this goal.
With both design and analysis model at hand, the optimizer can investigate changes in the analysis model
responses for finite changes in the design variables. In the process of searching for an optimum, the optimizer
utilizes the results of the finite element analysis as well as structural response derivatives, or sensitivities,
computed by the program. The resultant solution, or optimal design, is in this case that combination of wP

design variable values which minimize the weight of the structure while satisfying the constraints on tip
displacement and natural frequencies.
It is unlikely that the resulting optimal I-beam cross sectional dimensions would be an exact match to a readily
available manufactured beam. So, the final stage of design usually consists of using the design optimization
results to assist in choosing appropriate sizes of I-beams from a list of available sections, followed by
reanalysis/redesign to verify these selections. In practice, optimization is most useful as a design tool to suggest
possible design improvements, rather than as a “solution” technique.
The following examples explain in brief some other possible applications of design optimization:
A complex spacecraft is in a conceptual design stage. The total weight of the spacecraft cannot
exceed 3,000 pounds. The nonstructural equipment including the payload is 2,000 pounds. Static
loads are prescribed based on the maximum acceleration at launch. Also, the flexibility requirement
in space requires that the fundamental elastic frequency must be above 12 Hz. It is crucial to reduce
the structural weight since it costs several thousand dollars to place one pound of mass in a low earth
orbit. There are three proposed designs: truss, frame, and stiffened shell configurations. Currently all
the designs fail to satisfy at least one design requirement and are expected to be overweight. At this
stage, we want to determine which configuration(s) promises the best performance and warrants
detailed design studies. Also, the payload manager needs to know how much weight could be saved
if the frequency requirement were relaxed from 12 Hz to 10 Hz. The spacecraft’s structure contains
about 150 structural parameters which we may want to vary simultaneously.
One part of a vehicle’s frame structure is found to be overstressed. Unfortunately, it is too expensive
to redesign that particular frame component at this stage in the engineering cycle. However, other
structural components nearby can be modified without severe cost increases. There are nearly 100
structural design parameters that can be manipulated. The design goal is to reduce the magnitude of
the stresses by reducing the internal load to the overstressed member.
A frame structure which supports a set of sensitive instruments must withstand severe in-service
dynamic loads. Modal test results are available from comprehensive tests performed on the prototype
structure. We would like to create a finite element model for dynamic analysis that is much less
detailed than the original model created for stress analysis since the costs of dynamic analysis using a
complex model would be prohibitive. However, we want to ensure that the first ten modes obtained
from our simplified model are in close agreement with those obtained from the test results. The goal
is to determine suitable properties for the lumped quantities in our simplified dynamic model such
that the first ten eigenvalues correlate well with the prototype.
The various types of optimizations which can be carried out in Nastran are:
•Sizing Optimization
•Shape Optimization
•Topology Optimization
Aeroelasticity
MSC Nastran provides efficient solutions for the problems related to aeroelasticity , which is a branch of
applied mechanics that deals with the interaction of aerodynamic, inertial, and structural forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;53 Chapter 2: MSC Nastran Capabilities
Main Index
Aeroelasticity is important in the design of airplanes, helicopters, missiles, suspension bridges, and even tall
chimneys and power lines.
The primary factors of aeroelasticity include flying qualities (that is, stability and control), flutter, and
structural loads arising from maneuvers and atmospheric turbulence. Methods of aeroelastic analysis differ
according to the time dependence of the inertial and aerodynamic forces that are involved. For analyses of
flying qualities and maneuvering loads wherein the aerodynamic loads vary relatively slowly, quasi-static
methods are applicable. The remaining problems are dynamic, and methods of analysis differ according to
whether the time dependence is arbitrary (that is, transient or random) or simply oscillatory in the steady
state.
MSC Nastran considers three classes of aeroelastic problems:
Static Aeroelastic Response
Aerodynamic Flutter
Aeroelastic Response
Static Aeroelastic Response
For analyses of flying qualities and maneuvering loads, the assumption of quasi-steady motion is valid; i.e.,
the dynamics of the flexible structure are neglected and quasi-static methods are applicable. By assuming
linear behavior of the aerodynamic, inertial, and structural forces during the motion, the equations of
equilibrium in quasi-steady flight are solved in closed algebraic (matrix) form. The aerooelastic stability and
control characteristics are found along with the external load distributions and the internal loads and stresses
in the structural elements.
The static aeroelastic analysis solves the trim condition in a maneuver that is assumed to be quasi-steady so
that dynamic structural effects are ignored. The formulation of the equilibrium equations provides the
aerodynamic stability and control derivatives as an integral part of the trim process. The external flight loads
and the corresponding internal loads and stresses in the finite elements are available as postprocessing
operations on the trim solution.
Aerodynamic Flutter
Flutter is the oscillatory aeroelastic instability encountered at a relative airspeed, where energy extracted from
the airstream during a period of oscillation is exactly dissipated by the hysteretic damping of the structure.
The motion is divergent in a range of speeds above the flutter speed. Flutter analysis utilizes complex
eigenvalue analysis to determine the combination of airspeed and frequency for which the neutrally damped
motion is sustained.
Three methods of flutter analysis are listed below:
1.American flutter method (called the K-method in MSC Nastran),
2.Efficient K-method (called the KE-method) for rapid flutter evaluations,
3.British flutter method (called the PK-method) for more realistic representation of the unsteady
aerodynamic loads as frequency dependent stiffness and damping terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Getting Started Guide 54
Main Index
The complex eigenvalue analysis is specified by the user with the K-method, and the QR -transformation
method is used with the KE- and PK-methods. Linear and/or surface splines may be used to connect the
aerodynamic and structural grid points.
Dynamic Aeroelastic Response
The aeroelastic dynamic response method determines the response of the aircraft to time-varying excitations.
Atmospheric turbulence is the primary example of this type of excitation, but store ejection loads and landing
gear impact can also have an aeroelastic component. Methods of generalized harmonic (Fourier) analysis are
applied to the linear system to obtain the response to the excitation. The turbulence model may be regarded
either as a stationary random loading or as a discrete gust.
The gust analysis capability computes response to random atmospheric turbulence and to discrete one-
dimensional gust fields. The random response parameters calculated are given below:
Power spectral density
Root mean square response
Mean frequency of zero crossings.
The response to the discrete gust is calculated by direct and inverse Fourier transform methods since the
oscillatory aerodynamics are only known in the frequency domain. Time histories of response quantities are
the output in the discrete case.
Aerodynamic Methods
There are fi ve oscillatory aerodynamic theories available for flutter analysis. Different types of Aerodynamic
methods are listed below.
Subsonic methods:
a.Doublet-Lattice Method with body interference
b.Strip Theory
Supersonic methods:
a.Mach Box Method
b.Piston Theory
c.(Aero II option) multiple interfering surface method called ZONA51
Thermal Analysis
Thermal analysis  attempts to predict the temperatures and heat flows in and around a structure. The results
of a thermal analysis are often used in subsequent analysis to determine a structure’s thermally induced
response. MSC Nastran provides for convenient quasi-static coupling between thermal and structural Note:   The Static and Dynamic Aeroelastic Response solutions uses both subsonic Doublet-Lattice
and supersonic ZONA51 aerodynamics methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;55 Chapter 2: MSC Nastran Capabilities

analyses. Heat transfer problems are categorized as linear or nonlinear, and steady-state or transient. In
addition, there are three modes of heat transfer: conduction, convection, and radiation. Each mode displays
its own character and each can be analyzed with MSC Nastran.
Conduction deals with the flow of heat in the interior of a body obeying Fourier’s Law.
For steady-state analysis, a material’s thermal conductivity determines the relative ease with which
heat can flow throughout the body.
In transient analysis, the material’s ability to store energy is also taken into consideration with
specific heat or heat capacitance.
In addition, a phase change, largely an isothermal process, can be involved in a large release or absorption of
thermal energy in the interior of a body.
MSC Nastran can analyzes free and forced convection behavior when thermal communication between a
conduction-dominated solid structure and its surroundings take place. Convection boundary conditions
allows heat transfer between the structure and the surrounding environment due to fluid motion.
Free convection or Natural convection is a mechanism, or type of heat transport, in which the fluid motion
is not generated by any external source (like a pump, fan, suction device, etc.) but only by density differences
in the fluid occurring due to temperature gradients. This buoyancy-generated fluid motion is described by a
free convection heat transfer coefficient. Forced convection heat transfer is based upon an understanding of
the externally driven fluid flow field. Problems in which heat transfer coefficients are functions of
temperature are nonlinear.
Radiation heat transfer can be analyzed within enclosures and as radiative communication to space. In
radiation exchange, no transport media is required for heat transfer to occur. All radiation exchange problems
are nonlinear.
Other types of boundary conditions include:
Surface heat flux loads
Temperature-specified boundary conditions
Internal heat generation loads
Transient Thermal Analysis
This deals with the study of systems in transition, typically from one operating state point to another. In
transient analysis, we solve for the thermal response due to time varying fluctuations in boundary conditions,
or the relaxation of a set of initial conditions as the body heads toward a steady-state or equilibrium
temperature distribution.
Composite Materials
The term composite  refers to an engineering material that is made up of more than one material. Composite
materials for construction, engineering, and other similar applications are formed by combining two or more
materials in such a way that the constituents are still distinguishable and not fully blended.  Classical
lamination theory takes the term composite another step to mean a material that is composed of stacks of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Getting Started Guide 56
Main Index
layers or plies, having its own orthotropic properties. These plies are oriented at angles one to another as
shown in the four ply example. When the plies are glued together, they act as one material. The ability to
orient the fibers in particular directions allows designers to tailor the mechanical properties of a composite
material to match the loading environment.
Figure 2-18  Four Ply Example
Plies are typically made of fibers glued in place by a matrix. If the ply is a tape, all the fibers are oriented in
the same direction. Cloth plies have fibers woven in two directions. Many different materials can be used as
fibers or matrices. Examples of fibers include graphite, glass, boron, silicon carbide, and tungsten. Examples
of matrices include epoxy and aluminum.
MSC Nastran shell elements can have composite properties. The element entries reference a composite
property entry that defines the stacking order, thickness, angle, and material of each ply. Several composite
failure theories are available in MSC Nastran (Tsai-Wu, Hoffmann, Hill, and maximum strain/stress) to
predict ply failures. Nonlinear progressive failure analysis may also be performed.
Fluid-Structure Interaction
MSC Nastran performs fully coupled fluid-structure analysis , and this analysis is primarily applied in the
areas of acoustic and noise control analysis. Such as, in the design of passenger compartments of automobiles
and aircraft.
The methodology used for fluid-structure analysis is called as a Pressure Method, which is similar to the
Displacement Method in structural analysis, where pressures instead of displacements are calculated at the
fluid points. The velocities and accelerations of the fluid points are similar to forces in structural analysis. The
fluid can be modeled with existing three-dimensional elements as follows:

CTETRA
The above elements can adopt to the properties of irrotational and compressible fluids suitable for acoustic
analysis or other types of analyses governed by the three-dimensional wave equation. In addition, two
elements are available for acoustic analysis.
Barrier (CHACBR )
Absorber ( CHACAB )
The interface between the fluid and the structure can be modeled so that the grid points of the fluid are
similar with those of the structure. This is called a matching mesh. If not, it is called as non-matching mesh.
In either case by default, coupling for the stiffness and mass is automatically computed.
It is sometimes useful to find the contribution of a set of grid points to the noise level in an acoustic cavity.
For example, in an automobile the entire roof assembly contributes significantly to the noise level inside the
passenger cabin; as such it is necessary to compute and minimize the contribution of this panel. A panel may
be defined with the PANEL entry, which references a set of structural grid points.
Coupled fluid-structural analysis is available in the dynamic solution sequences using the Direct Method
(SOLs 107 through 109), and the Modal Method (SOLs 110 through 112). It should be noted that in SOLs
110 through 112, the normal modes are computed separately for the fluid and structural parts of the model;
in other words, the uncoupled modes of the fluid and structure are used in the modal formulation of the
stiffness, mass, and damping.
Direct Matrix Abstraction Program
The Direct Matrix Abstraction Program (DMAP) is a macro language used to build and modify solution
sequences in MSC Nastran. The DMAP language contains powerful matrix instructions as well as flexible
scalar variable (parameter) operations. The File Management Section (FMS) is used for the attachment,
initialization, and manipulation of databases. Details are presented on the structured solution sequence
(SOLs 100 through 200), DMAP structure, and NDDL.
A DMAP program consists of a series of functional blocks called modules, each of which has a unique name
and a specific function. Modules are executed sequentially; branching and looping operations are performed
by DMAP control statements. Modules communicate through the MSC Nastran Executive System (NES)
via logical collections of data called data blocks  and parameters .
For additional information, please refer to See “MSC Nastran DMAP Programmer’s Guide”
Fatigue Analysis
Very often the terms fatigue , fracture , and durability are used  interchangeably. However, each of them
convey a specific meaning.Note:   The absorber and barrier elements can be used to analyze acoustic noise control devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Getting Started Guide 58
Main Index
Fatigue : This is a failure under a repeated or otherwise varying load which never reaches a level
sufficient to cause  failure in a single application. It can also be thought of as the initiation and
growth of a crack, or growth from a pre-existing defect,  until it reaches a critical size, such as
separation into two or more parts.
Fatigue analysis itself usually refers to one of two methodologies: either the  Stress-Life (S-N)  or S-N
method, commonly referred to as Total Life  since it makes no distinction between initiating or
growing a crack, or the Local Strain  or Strain-Life (e-N)  method, commonly referred to as the Crack
Initiation  method which concerns itself only with the initiation of a crack.
Fracture : A fracture is the growth or propagation of a crack once it has been initiated. Fracture also
denotes sudden  breakage of a component or structure in two. However for the purposes of this
manual it refers to the life  prediction method of crack growth as implemented using LEFM.
MSC  Nastran fatigue analysis concerns itself only with the prior two types of fatigue analysis and is
not applicable for crack growth or propagation. For this capability refer to MSC Nastran’s  cohesive
zone modeling and/or virtual crack closure technique (VCCT) or MSC Fatigue, which uses a LEFM
method for crack growth prediction.
Durability: It is the conglomeration of all aspects that effect the life of a product and usually
concerns itself  with much more than just fatigue and fracture, but also loading conditions,
environmental concerns,  material characterizations, and testing simulations to name a few. A true
product durability program in  an organization that takes all of these aspects and more into
consideration.
Five Box Trick of Fatigue Analysis
These fatigue analysis example exercises are constructed around the concept of the fatigue “five-box trick.”
The illustration below depicts this well. For any life analysis whether it be fatigue or fracture there are always
three inputs. The first three boxes are the inputs; box four is the analysis; and box five contains the results.Note:   Fatigue cracks initiate and grow as a result of cyclic plastic deformation. Without plasticity there
can be no fatigue failure. All attempts are made in this guide to explain how plasticity is taken
into account when determining fatigue life from linear elastic finite element analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;59 Chapter 2: MSC Nastran Capabilities
Main Index
1.Cyclic Mat erial Information : Materials behave differently when they are subject to cyclic  as opposed
to monotonic  loading. Monotonic Properties  are the result of material tests where the load is steadily
increased until the test coupon breaks. Cyclic Properties  are obtained from material tests where the
loading is reversed and cycled until failure at various load levels. These parameters differ depending
on the fatigue analysis type involved.
2.Service Loadi ng Information : The proper specification of the variation of the loading is extremely
important to achieve an accurate fatigue life prediction. The loading can be defined in various
manners. Whether it be time based, frequency based, or in the form of some sort of spectra depends
on the fatigue analysis type to be used. When working with finite element models the loading can be
force, pressure, temperature, displacement, or a number of other types. Loading in the test world
usually refers to the acquisition of a response measurement, usually from a strain gauge.
3.Geometry Information : Geometry has different meanings depending on whether you are working
from a finite element model or from a test specimen. In the testing world, the geometry input is the
Kt (stress concentration factor) since the point of failure is usually away from the actual point of
measurement. Therefore a geometry Stress Concentration Factor, Kt , is defined to relate the measured
response to that at the failure location. You can think of this as a fudge factor. The corresponding
role of finite elements is to produce fields of Kt over the entire model, with the additional
complication that these local stress concentration factors are in the form of stress tensors.
4.Analysis : The correctness and accuracy of each of the above inputs is important in that any error in
any of these will be magnified through the fatigue analysis procedure, the fourth box, since this
process is logarithmic. A ten percent error in loading magnitude could result in a 100% error in the
predicted fatigue life. In a conventional finite element based fatigue analysis, the 4th box often
contains both the stress prediction and fatigue life calculation.
5.Results : The fifth box is the postprocessing or results evaluation. This can take on the form of color
contours on a finite element model or a tabular listing but also quite often leads back into the three
inputs to see what effect variations of these inputs will have on the life prediction. This is referred to
as a sensitivity or a “what if” study. This is extremely useful at times when you are not quite sure about
the accuracy of one of the inputs. This then leads to design optimization using fatigue life as a design
constraint or possibly even as a design objective.
Life P rediction Methods
There are three main life prediction methods as already mentioned earlier. These are Total Life , Crack Initiation ,
and Crack Growth (Propagation) . Total life is aptly named in that only the total life of the component is of
concern and not when a crack will initiate or how quickly it will grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Getting Started Guide 60
Main Index
The three methods are related to each other by the fact that the total number of cycles to failure, Nf, equals
the number of cycles to initiate a crack, Ni, plus the number of cycles to propagate that crack, Np. The three
methods have grown out of different needs over the decades using different techniques and having different
degrees of accuracy. So in theory this equation is true, but in practice when applying the three methods to
the same problem, rarely, if ever does it add up.
In reality however, rarely are all three methods used on the same problem, mainly because different industries
adopt different analysis methods depending on the driving design philosophy. See Design Philosophies  in the
MSC Nastran Embedded Fatigue User’s Guide .
Finite El ement Analysis Methods
In order to do life predictions, MSC Nastran embedded fatigue analysis supports use of stress-life and strain-
life methods using the stress/strain response results from different finite element (FE) analysis techniques.
The table below summarizes which FE analysis types are applicable to which life prediction methods in this
release of the software.

When to Use Which Method
Of the three fatigue methods used to predict life, it is important to understand when to use which. This will
become more evident as you proceed through this manual and work each exercise. As a quick answer to this
question, the following guidelines are presented.
Stress-Life (S-N or To tal Life)
Long life or High Cycle Fatigue (HCF)  problems, where there is little Plasticity  since the S-N method is
based on nominal stress
Components where crack initiation or crack growth modeling is not appropriate, e.g., composites,
welds, plastics, and other non-ferrous materials
Situations where large amounts of pre-existing S-N data exist
Components which are required by a control body to be designed for fatigue using standard data
such as MIL handbook data.
Spot weld analysis and random vibration induced fatigue problems
Strain-Life (Crack Ini tiation or Local Strain or -N)
Mostly defect free, metallic structures or components
Components where crack initiation is the important Failure Criterion  - safety critical components
Locating the point(s) where cracks may initiate, and hence the growth of a crack should be
considered
Evaluating the effect of alternative materials and different surface conditions
Components which are made from metallic, isotropic ductile materials which have symmetric cyclic
stress-strain behavior
Components that experience short lives -  Low Cycle Fatigue (LCF)  - where plasticity is dominant
Crack Gro wth (Damage Tolerant Design)
Pre-cracked structures or structures which must be presumed to be already cracked when
manufactured such as welds
Prediction of test programs to avoid testing components where cracks will not grow
Planning inspection programs to ensure checks are carried out with the correct frequency
To simply determine the amount of life left after crack initiation
Components which are made from metallic, isotropic ductile materials which have symmetric cyclic
stress-strain behavior*For frequency domain solutions, please see the MSC Nastran Embedded Vibration Fatigue User’s

High Performance Computin g
Hardware Factors Affecting Simulation Performance
The performance of computer aided engineering (CAE) simulations is dependent on a computer’s hardware
as much as it is dependent on the underlying algorithms. I/O performance, memory bandwidth, memory
capacity, and flops/core generally defines the overall performance of a single computer used for CAE
simulations. The typical configuration for many users of CAE software is to either run on a single, separate
workstation consisting of the above configuration or to run on an HPC Cluster used by many employees at
the engineering company where these nodes are clustered together in a network.
Communication costs between these separate nodes is measured by network bandwidth and latency. The
impact of the hardware, whether it is network latency or CPU speed, is felt differently for different
applications due to the underlying algorithms.
A very enlightening image was published at The Next Platform  that we have reproduced in Figure 2-19. In the
figure, we are considering structural analysis simulations, crash simulations, and fluid simulations. We can
see that if we are modeling structures (with MSC Nastran SOL 101), or crash (with MSC Nastran SOL 700),
or fluids (with ANSYS Fluent), then we get a very different dependency on performance with respect to
network latency, network bandwidth, flops/core, cores, memory capacity, memory bandwidth, and I/O
performance.
We can also observe that fluid simulations get the most benefit from more cores because fluid simulations are
using explicit methods that are highly parallelizable. It is one of the reasons why we often observe massively
parallel computing (1000s or 10,000s of processors) used with fluid simulations. Crash simulations also
depend on explicit calculations that are highly parallelizable.
Figure 2-19  Relative Importance of Different Hardware Features for Various Simulations
The structural simulations described in this image generally correspond to MSC Nastran simulations, in
particular, SOL 101, 103, and 400. The dominant aspect of these simulations is usually the matrix
factorization of the stiffness matrix, which represents how the corresponding structural displacements&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;63 Chapter 2: MSC Nastran Capabilities
Main Index
correspond to loads. If the matrix and the factorization all fit within existing memory, then memory
bandwidth is critical in determining performance.
Often the matrix and factorization process does not fit in existing memory and so I/O performance and
memory capacity are critical. This can be the case with MSC Nastran although we will see in the remainder
of this HPC Manual that there are times where flops/core or cores are equally beneficial.
Memory
Memory capacity and bandwidth is perhaps the most underestimated way to improve performance in FE
analysis. Increasing memory capacity allows more of the problem to be solved in-core where access speeds
can be orders of magnitude faster than out-of-core where disk speeds matter. Memory can also serve as a
cache for I/O by the operating system, or as you will see below, by MSC Nastran itself with the use of Buffer
Pool.
Memory may be purchased as DDR3/DDR4. The following table shows a comparison:
Additional RAM may significantly reduce elapsed times for large models. The following is the chart of
recommended RAM for linear or nonlinear statics models. Dynamic models may also perform better with
additional RAM but it is more problem dependent and harder to gauge based on DOF as it also depends on
frequency range in the dynamic problem.
Disks
When MSC Nastran exceeds the system memory cache buffer, the I/O will go to disk. Since finite element
analysis can be intensive, the disk configuration may impact the performance of the analysis. Improving disk
performance can be important to MSC Nastran performance.
Do not use a network drive.
SSD disks are very fast and highly recommended for scratch space.
Faster disks, e.g., 15000 RPM, may help performance.
Run with SCR=YES  if you do not need to save a database.Memory Type Speed

RAID 0 with multiple disks for SDIR is recommended. Other levels of RAID  (for example, RAID 5 ) have
redundancy which is not needed for scratch files and may have some performance degradation.
We describe in general terms how memory performance, CPU performance, I/O details, and parallel
capabilities affect simulation performance of the following:
Linear static analysis (SOL101). For details, see “ Optimal Performance of Linear Static Analysis (SOL 101) ”
of  MSC Nastran High Performance Computing User’s Guide .

MSC Nastran High Performance Computing User’s Guide .

refer to MSC Nastran High Performance Computing User’s Guide
Hardware Accelerators
Performance improvements derived from Hardware Accelerators vary a great deal. While in some cases, GPUs
may greatly increase performance, in other cases, GPUs may degrade performance. Thus, caution should be
used in predicting the amount of potential performance gain.
GPUs help with large dense models.
GPUs degrade performance for ACMS, thus they are disabled for ACMS.
Static analysis for which GPUs help may benefit more from the CASI solver in cases where the CASI
solver is allowed.
In many cases using a high number of SMP processors may benefit as much as a GPU.
Multiple GPUs are only used when MSC Nastran is running DMP. The command line option is as
follows: gpuid=0,1
Where the numbers specified are the minor numbers from the nvidia-smi –q  command.
GPU performance will improve the following system cell settings. These settings will happen
automatically in 2016 for GPU jobs:
system(655)=32 system(656)=1024 system(205)=320 system(219)=384
system(220)=320 system(221)=320
For details of the keywords and Nastran submittal options, refer to the MSC Nastran Installation and Operation
Guide .
Network Connections
Network connections affect the analysis in the following scenarios:
If a directory containing files is remotely mounted&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;65 Chapter 2: MSC Nastran Capabilities
Main Index
If an analysis is running DMP over a network.
The largest performance gains from MSC Nastran by using multiple nodes is that each process will have an
increase of RAM available by dispersing the runs amongst different computers. If an analysis can take
advantage of the additional RAM on multiple nodes, then faster networks may help for problem types that
have a substantial amount of communication.

Types of MSC Nastran Files
In order to run MSC Nastran, it is mandatory to create an input file to define the entire finite element model.
Once the file is prepared, you can execute MSC Nastran by invoking a special command followed by the
name of the input file. Upon completion of the finite element calculations, MSC Nastran creates several files
each containing different types of information. We refer to the files that contain the results as the output files.
Different types of file extensions which are used in MSC Nastran are listed in the Table 3-1.
MSC Nastran Input Files
To do an analysis using MSC Nastran, you must generate an input file describing the structure’s geometry,
material properties, boundary conditions, and loads. MSC Nastran input file contains a complete description
of the finite element model, including:
Type of analysis to be performed
The geometry of the model
Node locations
Element connections
Element properties and material dataTable 3-1  File Types

Structure under consideration
Loads acting on it
Constraints (boundary conditions)
Plots to be created
Requests for the type of output quantities to be calculated
In addition to defining the physical structure, the input file also specifies the type of analysis to be performed
and other pertinent information. The input file is an ASCII text file which can be created using any text
editor or one of the many preprocessors that interface with MSC Nastran.
After the generation of the input file is complete, it is submitted for execution as a batch process. The MSC
Nastran input file is useful in the following ways:
Can be viewed and edited in any text editor
Can include comments to document modeling assumptions and changes
Allows the user to add entries which are not supported in Patran
Useful in debugging a model.
The MSC Nastran input file is often referred to as the bulk data file ( .bdf)  or the data file (.dat)  in the
MSC Nastran manuals. It consists of six distinct sections—three of them are required and the other three are
one-line delimiters.
Input data is organized in (optional) blocks. Key words identify the data for each optional block. This form
of input enables you to specify only the data for the optional blocks that you need to define your problem.
The various blocks of input are optional in the sense that many have built-in default values which can be
used in the absence of any explicit input from you.
The input requires records that are 80 characters (or columns) in length. The structure of the input file is
shown in the Figure 3-1.&lt;/p&gt;

The required sections of a typical MSC Nastran input file are:
Executive Control: It describes the problem or solution type and optional file management. It is
terminated by an CEND  parameter.
Case Control: It defines the load history and output requests. It is terminated by the BEGIN  BULK&lt;br&gt;
option.
Bulk Data: It defines a detailed model, load and constraint description. Contains a model data
starting with the BEGIN BULK  option is terminated by the ENDDATA . It may contain multiple
Bulk Data sections when defining model partitions called Part Superelements.
Delimiters
The delimiter entries are required to separate sections of the input file:
Table 3-2  Delimiter Entries of the Input File
Nastran Statement
The MSC Nastran statement is optional and is used to modify system parameters (also called system cells)
that control internal solution processing or provide specific diagnostics. Examples include aspects of working
memory, datablock size, datablock parameters, machine specific issues, numerical methods, etc. It determines
the overall program control for the current run.
The MSC Nastran statement if used, must be placed before the Executive Control Section. Since it is used
for special circumstances, it is not needed in most runs. It may also be specified in the Runtime
Configuration (RC) files at the system, user, and job level.
For further information refer to Executing MSC Nastran  in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide .
File Management Section (FMS)
The File Management Section (FMS) is also optional. If required, it is also located before the Executive
Control Section. The goal of FMS is to make the operating system invisible to the user. It allocates files,
manipulates the database, and performs restarts. It also determines overall program control for the current
run. It is commonly used when solving large problems. It is used primarily to attach or initialize MSC Delimiters Description
ID A,B First statement in executive control section (optional).

Nastran databases and Fortran files. The initialization of a Fortran file includes the specification of its
filename, Fortran unit numbers, and Fortran attributes. MSC Nastran Statement and FMS use free field
format (in columns 1-72).&lt;br&gt;
For many MSC Nastran problems, FMS are not required, because a default FMS is executed at the beginning
of every run. For detailed discussion of the FMS, refer to File Management Statements  in the MSC Nastran Quick
Reference Guide .
Executive Control Section
The Executive Control Section is the first required group of statements in any MSC Nastran input file. It
provides overall control of the solution. It provides overall job control for the problem and sets up initial
switches to control the flow of the program through the desired analysis. Entries in the Executive Control
Section are called statements.
The Executive Control Section contains statements that does the following:
Select the solution sequence to be run (e.g., statics, normal modes).
Request various diagnostic outputs.
Contain user-written DMAP .
Choose a sparsesolver or domainsolver option.
Executive control section and case control section uses free field format in columns 1-72. Input may begin in
any of these columns and is separated by commas or blanks. The set of the executive control section must be
terminated by a CEND  delimiter.
The basic functions of this section are:
Identify the job (optional TIME  statement)
Select the type of analysis to be performed, that are required for all MSC Nastran jobs
Set limits on the allowable CPU time (maximum time limits for execution)
Most statements are order independent. Exceptions are the COMPILE , COMPILER , ALTER , ENDALTER ,
and LINK  statements. The LINK  statement must appear after all COMPILE  statements. The COMPILER&lt;br&gt;
statement (or equivalent DIAGs) must appear before all COMPILE  statements. This statement sets the
default print control for subsequent COMPILE  statements.
For a complete description of the Executive Control Section, refer to  Executive Control Statements  of the MSC
Nastran Quick Reference Guide .&lt;/p&gt;

Summary of Executive Control Statements
The Executive Control Statements consists of the following statements:
The following sections briefly describe three main statements i.e, ID, SOL,  and  CEND.
ID Statement
This optional statement is used to identify the job. If used, the ID statement must be first given in the
Executive Control Section. The format is:
ID i1, i2
i1 and i2 are character strings
i1 may be 1 to 8 characters in length.
i2 can be of any length
The first character of each string must be alphabetic.Executive Control Statements
ALTER Specifies deletion and/or insertion of the DMAP statements that follow.
APP Specifies an approach in a solution sequence.
CEND Designates the end of the Executive Control statements.
COMPILE Requests compilation of specified subDMAPs or the NDDL file.
COMPILER Specifies DMAP compilation diagnostics.
DIAG Requests diagnostic output or modifies operational parameters.
DOMAINSOLVER Selects domain decomposition solution methods.
ECHO Controls the echo of Executive Control statements.
ENDALTER Designates the end of a DMAP sequence headed by an ALTER.
GEOMCHECK Specifies tolerance values and options for optional finite element geometry
tests.
ID Specifies a comment.
LINK Requests the link of a main subDMAP .
MALTER Inserts and/or deletes DMAP statements in solution sequences
MODEL_CHECK Specifies model checkout run options.
SOL Requests execution of a solution sequence or DMAP program.

SOL Statement
This statement is used to select the type of analysis (solution sequence) to be performed. The format of the
SOL statement is as follows:
SOL n
Where n is a positive integer which identifies the solution type or the character name of the solution
procedure.
This manual describes SOL 101 linear static analysis. Many other solution types are available in MSC
Nastran, explained in Case Control Section .
CEND Statement
The CEND statement is a recommended statement that designates the end of the executive control section
(and the beginning of the case control section). The format of the statement is:
CEND
A variety of other executive control statements are available, most notably the DIAG statement which offers
you a variety of useful diagnostic information. Discussion of these statements is beyond the scope of this
manual, but more information can be found in the Executive Control Statements  of MSC Nastran Quick Reference
Guide .

CEND  = Required entry = Last Entry in Executive Control
DIAG J = Optional statement - enables diagnostics
Case Control Section
The Case Control Section defines the subcase structure for the problem. It makes selections from the Bulk
Data Section, and creates output requests. This section provides control of the individual loadings to be
applied and the output requests. Entries in the case control section are called commands. The case control
section always follows the Executive Control Section and precedes the Bulk Data Section and is required in
every run.
The primary functions of the case control section are as follows:
Specifies sets of bulk data input that are to be used in the analysis (e.g., loads, constraints, eigenvalue
solution method, etc.)
Specifies and control the type of analysis output required (e.g., forces, stresses, and displacements)&lt;/p&gt;

Main Index
Bulk data entries consists of the following three data formats:
Integer: Integers must be entered without a decimal point (e.g.: 1, 134, 267, etc.).
Real: Real data has a decimal point and may have an exponent. There are several ways to represent
real numbers. Following representations of the real number 123.4 are numerically equivalent and
acceptable to MSC Nastran. All these represent the same number as follows:
Character String (BCD): BCD is represented as a text string
•It must start with a letter (A-Z)
•It may contain numbers in the text (0-9)
•It must be 8 or fewer characters long
•No special characters or embedded blanks may be used
•Examples: TEST123, X32, DUM1

Continuation Entries
Continuation entries must be used in case of entries that require more than one line of input. These entries
may be generated automatically when they are in sorted order. Continuation entries are not required when
the entries are in sorted order.
The format of the continuation entries is as follows:
The parent entry can be blank in columns 74-80 (field 10), and the continuation entry can be blank in
columns 2-8 (field 1). For small field entries, the first column of the continuation entry may be blank or
contain a + symbol. For large field entries, the first column of the continuation entry must contain a *
symbol.
The input rules are listed as follows:
When you use continuation mnemonics, a plus sign (+) or astrix (*) is required in column 1, field 1
of a continuation entry. The remaining contents in field 1 of a continuation entry must be identical
to the entry in field 10 (columns 74 through 80) of the parent entry (or the preceding continuation
entry).
Any entry in the first column of field 10 (column 73) on the parent entry is ignored by the
continuation entry.
Small field and large field continuation entries may be used together in defining a single data item
entry.
Methods for Entering a MAT8
There are two methods for entering a MAT8 entry with continuation.

Field Formats in Input Files
MSC Nastran has three different field formats  for input data:
The NASTRAN statement, file management section, executive control section, and case control section use
free field format. The Bulk Data Section allows the use of any of the three formats.
MSC Nastran Bulk Data contains ten fields per input data entry. The first field contains the character name
of the Bulk Data item (e.g., GRID , CBAR , MAT1 , etc.). Fields two through nine contain data input
information for the Bulk Data entry. The tenth field never contains data—it is reserved for entry
continuation information, if applicable.
Consider the format of a typical MSC Nastran Bulk Data entry, the GRID entry, which is used in MSC
Nastran to describe the geometry of the structural model:1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
MAT8 171 30.+6 1.+6 0.3 2.+6 3.+6 1.5+6 0.056

Different Field Formats
Free Field Format Input data fields are separated by commas.
Small Field Format Ten fields of eight characters each.
Large Field Format Ten fields each containing actual data are sixteen characters each. Large fields
are used when greater numerical accuracy is required.

Example:
We will now represent this example in free field, small field, and large field formats.
Free Field Format
In free field format , data fields are separated by commas or blanks (commas are strongly recommended). The
following shows the GRID Bulk Data entry example in free field format:
The rules for free field format are as follows:
Free field data entries must start in column 1
To skip one field, use two commas in succession. To skip two fields, use three commas in succession
Integer or character fields with more than eight characters cause a fatal error
Real numbers with more than eight characters are rounded off and lose some precision. For
example, an entry of 1.2345678+2 becomes 123.4568. If more significant digits are needed, use the
large field format.
Free field data cannot contain embedded blanks. An example of a free field embedded blank is
shown as follows:
Small Field Format
Small field format  separates a Bulk Data entry into ten fields of eight characters each:1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Main Index
The following is an example of the GRID entry in small field format:
The rules for small field format are as follows:
Fields 1 and 10 must be left justified
Fields 2 through 9 do not need to be either right or left justified, although aligning the data fields is
good practice.
Small field input data cannot contain any embedded blanks. An example of a small field embedded
blank is shown below:
Large Field Format
A high degree of numerical accuracy is required in some MSC Nastran applications. Large field format  is used
when small field format does not provide enough significant digits (recall that a minus sign, decimal point,
and the “E” in scientific notation count as characters).
Large field format requires (at least) two lines for each record, e.g. GRID data. The first and last field of each
line contains eight columns, and the fields in between contain 20224  columns. Large field entries are denoted
by an asterisk (&lt;em&gt;) immediately following the character string in field 1A of the first line and immediately
preceding the character string in field 1B of the second line.
The following is an example of the GRID Bulk Data entry example in large field format:

Input Format Rules
Rules for the input format are as follows:
Errors result if data extends beyond its field into another field
Input data items in fields 1 and 10 must be left justified
Input data in fields 2 through 9 do not have to be left or right justified
Input items must not have embedded blanks
All real numbers (including zero) must have a decimal point (this is a common error)
Many fields have a default value, if these fields are left blank, the default value will be used (Refer to&lt;br&gt;
MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide ).
Common Errors in Entry Format
Caution:  Failure to leave the proper number of fields blank when defining data values leads to either a fatal
error or wrong answers.&lt;br&gt;
Make sure you follow the below recommendations to avoid commonly made errors in the input format:
Leave the proper number of blanks or include the correct number of commas to delimit data fields.
Use the correct format for integer numbers and real numbers. See individual entry format in the
MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide  for these specifications.
Define all the required fields for the Bulk Data entries.
Make sure the continuation entries follow the parent entry, sometimes the content of the
continuation field may be ignored by setting system cell 357 to 1.1B 2 3 4 5 6B

MSC Nastran Output Files
After an input file is submitted for execution, several output files may be generated. Table 3-5 on page 84
provides description of all the potential files generated by MSC Nastran. Assuming the input file is named
run1.dat , see Install_dir/mscxxxx/doc/linstat/run1.dat .
The output files that are generated depend on your input file requests and the command line options that
you specify when the job is submitted. Some of the files shown will not be generated, and some will be
generated and deleted automatically once the job is complete.

Units
Always use a consistent set of units to develop a finite element model. MSC Nastran cannot interpret physical
units .
An example of inconsistency in usage of units is to specify model geometry in feet and the elastic modulus of
the material in pounds per square inch. MSC Nastran cannot detect the existence of inconsistent units. If
inconsistent units are used, wrong answers occur and no user warning messages are generated.
List of consistent systems of units are listed in the Table 4-1:

Continuations
Some Bulk Data entries require more than eight fields (72 columns) of data, continuations  are required in
such cases. T o do this, a parent entry (the first line) is followed by one or more continuation entries on
subsequent lines. For example, consider the following PBAR simple beam property entry (what each field

Meshes and Mesh Transitions
Main Index
Continuation Example:
+PB1 in field 10 of the parent entry is an arbitrary (and unique) user-defined pointer to field 1 of the second
line. +PB2 in the second line points the third line, and so on.
Continuation fields can also be generated automatically by MSC Nastran (this approach is the recommended
practice). T o automatically generate a continuation, the continuation line (or lines) must immediately follow
the parent Bulk Data entry. In addition, fields 1 and 10 of the continuation line (or lines) must be left blank.
MSC Nastran then generates unique continuations for you. This process is illustrated in the following
example:
Input  (.DAT) file:
Output (.f06) file:
For the above example the first character in field 10 of the first line of output ( .f06  file) is a blank. There
is nothing below the “.”. This, the first field of the second line, must be ++000001.
Meshes and Mesh Transitions
The finite element mesh is used to subdivide the CAD model into smaller domains called elements, and those
Elements are connected to some grid-points called nodes. Adding more or refining elements produces a finer
mesh, which can more closely represent an irregularly shaped structure.
The results are calculated by solving the relevant governing equations numerically at each of the nodes of the
mesh. The pattern and relative positioning of the nodes also affect the solution, the computational efficiency
and time. In general, a finer mesh is more accurate, but is also more computationally expensive.
Mesh transition regions are required in most finite element models. The purpose of mesh transitions  are: PBAR 39 6 2.9 1.86 2.92 .48 +PB1

solid element model, or the edge of a circular hole in a plate model.
As a general rule, avoid placing a mesh transition in an area of interest or in an area where there is a large
variation in stress (high stress gradient). Ideally, mesh transitions are modeled far away from areas of interest,
preferably in regions of relatively uniform stress (low stress gradient).
T ransition between different element types (even a transition from CQUAD4  to CTRIA3  elements) can
result in local stress anomalies. Normally these are localized and dissipate quickly as you move away from the
transition, but be aware that results may be less accurate in an area in or near the transition.
A simple mesh transition in a plate element model is shown in Figure 4-1.
Figure 4-1  Typical Plate Model Mesh Transition
In this example, the transition region consisting of triangular plate elements (CTRIA3s) would tend to be too
stiff compared to the adjacent CQUAD4 elements.
Designing the Model
Considerable engineering judgement about the behavior of the structure is required before the modeling
process begins. Since finite element modeling of a complex structure can involve significant engineering and
computer resources, a modeling plan is necessary. Various issues  that must be addressed in designing a model
are listed below:
Establish a project budget  to help you make modeling decisions.
A project budget takes into account the time available to do the job, labor hours available, and
computer resources. Increasing the model’s degrees of freedom increases computer costs, modeling
time, and time required to interpret the results. For a model with N degrees of freedom, computer
costs are divided roughly as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;93 Chapter 4: Modeling Issues
Using Test Models
Main Index
•Overhead (independent of N)
•Matrix Assembly (proportional to N)
•Solution (proportional to N2)
•Data Recovery (proportional to N)
For a statics problem with large degrees (100 or more) of freedom, these quantities are
approximately equal. For larger problems, the solution component dominates.
Understand exactly what needs to be solved and how accurate  the solution needs to be.
The question of accuracy is critical to model design, and to a considerable extent involves experience
and judgement. Increasing the number of elements generally increases accuracy. For example, 200
elements may be required to obtain a solution that is in error with theory by 15%, but an additional
100 elements may be required to improve the solution to 10%. Thus, it is important to understand
how adding elements improves accuracy, but with diminishing returns as you converge toward a
solution. More element detail (a finer mesh) is usually required in regions where high stress gradients
are expected and where high accuracy is required.
Understand the structure’s probable mode of failure.
MSC Nastran will only solve what you tell it to solve. In linear static analysis, for example, you can
compress a long, slender column indefinitely, resulting in a short, highly stressed column. In reality,
the physical structure will probably buckle under a small compressive load. Buckling analysis is a
different solution sequence altogether, requiring eigenvalue methods.
Recognize all loads, load application points, and reaction points.
There is often considerable uncertainty associated with knowledge of loads, and boundary
conditions are often less than ideal. Therefore, considerable care is required in this step.
Consider the function of the structure under load.
This will help you establish the primary load paths for bending, torsion, shear and axial loads.
Choose elements based on the expected behavior of the structure.
If necessary, perform sensitivity studies with small test models to determine the relationship between
the number of elements, solution accuracy, and modeling cost.
Exploit model symmetry whenever possible.
Symmetry permits the modeling of a single regular segment of the structure. The model’s
connection with the rest of the structure is represented with appropriate boundary conditions.
Using Test Models
Experiment With Small Test Models
One of the most useful and time saving methods in finite element work is the use of small test models . When
preparing a finite element model involving new or unfamiliar technology-typically an element or type of
solution you have never worked with before. Small test models involving only a handful of elements should
be developed first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Getting Started Guide
Using Test Models94
Main Index
These numerical experiments give valuable insight into element behavior, proposed modeling techniques,
sensitivity of the results to mesh size, or any other technical issue relevant to your analysis. Even the most
sophisticated MSC Nastran analysis methods can be learned and tested on simple models (ideally, create test
models that have readily available theoretical solutions). The key point is that new methods should never be
learned or tested on large, expensive, commercial models.
Inability to Predict the Response of your Structure
A second fundamental reason to use test models occurs when you have no ability to predict the general
behavior or critical regions of your structure, and, therefore, have no rational basis with which to design a
detailed model. Perhaps you have no prior experience with a structure, or its behavior is so complex that
engineering intuition is of little use. In such cases, an appropriate strategy is to build a crude initial model
(using few elements, but with correct loads and boundary conditions) to gain insight into the gross behavior
of the structure. The results of the initial model should aid in selecting elements and in determining where
refined mesh regions should be located in the detailed model. When you are in doubt, it is always best to start
with a small, inexpensive model.&lt;/p&gt;

Model Geometry
Model geometry is defined  in MSC Nastran with the help of grid points . A grid point is a point on or in the
structural continuum which is used to define a finite element. A simple model may have only a handful of
grid points; a complex model may have over a million grids. The structure’s grid points displace along with
the loaded structure. Each grid point of the structural model has six possible components of displacement:
Three translations  about the direction are as follows:
 x-
 y-
z-
Three rotations  about the axes are as follows:
x-
y-
z-.
The above components of displacement are called degrees of freedom  (DOFs).
Example
In Figure 5-1, on z-axis, a grid point has undergone two translations  (one in the positive x-direction and one
in the positive y-direction) and one rotation  (about the z-axis).

Grid Points
Grid points are used to define the geometry of a structure. As discussed in Model Geometry , each grid point
has six Degrees Of Freedom  (DOF): three translations and three rotations. The six degrees of freedom are
identified as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, as shown in the following figure.
Other commonly used terms  for the components of displacement at a grid point  are:
DOF 1 = T1 =  = translation  in direction 1
DOF 2 = T2 =  = translation  in direction 2
DOF 3 = T3 =  = translation  in direction 3
DOF 4 = R1 =  = rotation  about direction 1
DOF 5 = R1 =  = rotation  about direction 2
DOF 6 = R1 =   = rotation  about direction 3

Each grid point refers to two coordinate systems:
One system is used to locate the grid point (CP in field 3)
The other is used to establish the grid point’s displacement (output) coordinate system (CD in field
7).
The displacement coordinate system defines the direction of displacements, constraints, and other grid point
related quantities such as reaction forces. The basic (default) coordinate system is indicated by a zero or blank
in the CP and CD fields. CD and CP do not have to be the same coordinate system.
X1, X2, and X3 (fields 4 through 6) have the following meanings for different types of coordinate systems:
PS in field 8 allows you to apply constraints to any or all of the grid point’s DOFs. See Single Point
Constraints  for more information. Field 9 applies only to superelement analysis (superelement analysis is
described in Superelement Analysis ).

MSC Nastran provides six Bulk Data entry  options for defining local coordinate systems. Each local system
must be related directly or indirectly to the basic coordinate system. The six options are as follows:

Introduction
MSC Nastran offers a variety of general purpose and specialty finite elements . The common and widely used
elements are categorized in Table 6-1:
Several general notes apply to all MSC Nastran elements, which are listed below:
All elements in your model should have unique element ID numbers. Do not reuse element IDs on
different element types.
The formulation of an element’s stiffness matrix is independent of how you number the element’s
grid points.
Each element has its own element coordinate system defined by connectivity order or by other
element data. Element information (such as element force or stress) is output in the element
coordinate system.
Additional details concerning the features and use of each of MSC Nastran’s elements can be found in Bulk
Data Entries .
Spring Element (CELAS2)
Spring elements , also called zero-dimensional or scalar elements, connect two degrees of freedom, with one
at each grid point. They behave like simple extension/compression or rotational (e.g. clock) springs, carrying Table 6-1  The Basic  MSC Nastran Elements

either force or moment loads. Forces result in translational (axial) displacement and moments result in
rotational displacement.
CELAS2
The CELAS2 element defines a spring and includes spring property data directly on the element entry.
Format
The format of the CELAS2  entry is as follows:
The description for the above format is as follows:
Entering a zero or blank for either (Gi, Ci) pair indicates a grounded spring.
A grounded point is a point whose displacement is constrained to zero.
Also, G1 and G2 cannot be the same GRID point (same ID), but can be different grid points that
occupy the same physical point in the structure.
Spring elements do not have physical geometry in the same sense that beams, plates, and solids do,
and that is why they are called zero dimensional.
Example:
Consider the simple extensional spring shown in the Figure 6-1. One end is fixed and the other is subjected
to a 10  axial load. The axial stiffness of the spring (k) is 100 /inch. What is the displacement of

The required Bulk Data entries are specified as follows:
GRID 1201 at the fixed wall is constrained in all six degrees of freedom. GRID 1202 is constrained in degrees
of freedom 2 through 6 since the element it is connected to, only uses degree of freedom 1 (translation in the
X-direction). Recall that a grid point is free in all six degrees of freedom until it is told otherwise. If you keep
the degree of freedom of any GRID point unattached, either unconnected to an element’s stiffness or
unconstrained by other means-results in a rigid body motion singularity will lead to failure in static analysis.
The PARAM,AUTOSPC feature of Solution 101 automatically constrains these unconnected degrees of
freedom.

Figure 6-2  CELAS2 Spring Element Output
The displacement of GRID 1202 is 0.1 in. in the positive X-direction (as the spring is in tension). The hand
calculation is as follows:
The force in the spring element is calculated by MSC Nastran as:
where:
is the displacement of G1
is the displacement of G2
This brings up the crucial point that the sign of force (and stress) output for scalar elements depends on how
the grid points are listed (ordered) in defining an element, and not on a physical sense of tension or
compression. This is not the case when using line (one-dimensional) elements such as rods and beams.
Hence, be careful of how you interpret signs when using scalar elements.
Line Elements
Line elements , also called one-dimensional elements, are used to represent rod and beam behavior. A rod
element does not support bending, where as tension, compression, and axial torsion are supported. Only a
beam element supports bending.
MSC Nastran makes an additional distinction between simple  beams and complex  beams as follows:
Simple beams are modeled with the CBAR element and require that beam properties do not vary
with cross section. The CBAR element also requires that the shear center and neutral axis coincide
and is therefore not useful for modeling beams that warp, such as open channel sections.                         F O R C E S I N   S C A L A R   S P R I N G S    (C E L A S 2)

Complex beams are modeled with the CBEAM element, which has all of the CBAR’s capabilities
plus a variety of additional features. CBEAM elements permit tapered cross-sectional properties, a
noncoincident neutral axis and shear center, and cross-sectional warping. The CBEAM  element’s
additional capabilities are beyond the scope of this book—we will concentrate on rod and bar
elements.
Rod Element (CONROD)
CONROD
The CONROD element shown in Figure 6-3 has two grid points, one at each end, and supports axial force
and axial torsion. Thus, stiffness terms exist for only two degrees of freedom per grid point. All element
connectivity and property information is contained directly on the CONROD entry – no separate property
entry is required. This element is convenient when defining several rod elements having different properties.

CBAR Element Characteristics
CBAR
The CBAR  element is a general purpose beam that supports the following:
Tension and compression
Torsion (bending in two perpendicular planes)
Shear in two perpendicular planes
The CBAR uses two grid points and can provide stiffness to all six degrees of freedom of each grid
point
The displacement components of the grid points are three translations and three rotations.
The characteristics and limitations of the CBAR element are summarized as follows:
Its formulation is derived from classical beam theory (plane sections remain plane).
It must be straight and prismatic (properties cannot vary along the length).
The shear center and neutral axis must coincide (the CBAR element cannot model warping of open
sections).
Torsional stiffening of out-of-plane cross-sectional warping is neglected.
It includes optional transverse shear effects (important for short beams).
The principal axis of inertia need not coincide with the element axis.
The neutral axis may be offset from the grid points (an internal rigid link is created). This is useful
for modeling stiffened plates or gridworks.
A pin flag capability is available to provide a moment or force release at either end of the element
(this permits the modeling of linkages or mechanisms).
Refer to the following entries ( CBAR and CBEAM  in MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide ) or The CBAR Element , 94
and The CBEAM Element  in the MSC Nastran Linear Static Analysis User’s Guide  for further details.Note:   Further description on of offsets and pin flags is beyond the scope of this guide.&lt;/p&gt;

CBAR Element Coordinate System
For example, consider two possible orientations  of the same rectangular beam (no offsets), as shown in
Figure 6-4.
Figure 6-4  Two Orientations of the Same Beam
Although beams (a) and (b) are physically identical, their different orientations result in dramatically
different load carrying abilities. In this sense, they are completely different structures. Therefore, it is critical
to orient beam elements correctly.
The CBAR element coordinate system is described in Figure 6-5.
1.The element x-axis is automatically defined as the direction from GA to GB. The axis begins at GA.Note:   The CBAR element coordinate system is a common source of difficulty for the new user. It is
also critical to your model, since the beam’s cross sectional moments of inertia are defined (on
the PBAR entry) using the element coordinate system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Getting Started Guide 116
Main Index
2.Choose a direction for the beam’s orientation vector . Vector  starts at GA and contains the point (X1,
X2, X3). X1, X2, and X3, which are defined in the displacement coordinate system of GA, are entered
on fields 6, 7, and 8 of the CBAR entry. The direction of  with respect to the cross section is arbitrary,
but  is normally aligned with one of the beam’s principal planes of inertia. A choice of (1.0, 1.0, 0.0)
gives the following:&lt;/p&gt;

Surface Elements
Surface elements , also called two-dimensional elements, used to represent a structure whose thickness is small
compared to its other dimensions. Surface elements can model plates, which are flat, or shells, which have
single curvature (e.g., cylinder) or double curvature (e.g., sphere). For the grid points used to represent plate
elements, stiffness terms exist for five of the possible six degrees of freedom per grid point.
For linear analysis, MSC Nastran plate elements assume classical assumptions of thin plate behavior:
A thin plate is one in which the thickness is much less than the next larger dimension.
The deflection of the plate’s midsurface is small compared with its thickness.
The midsurface remains unstrained (neutral) during bending-this applies to lateral loads, not in-
plane loads.
The normal to the midsurface remains normal during bending.
Quadrilateral Plate Element (CQUAD4)
CQUAD4
The CQUAD4  is MSC Nastran’s most commonly used element for modeling plates, shells, and membranes.
The CQUAD4 can represent in-plane, bending, and transverse shear behavior, depending upon data
provided on the PSHELL property entry. The CQUAD4 element is a quadrilateral flat plate connecting four
grid points, as shown in Figure 6-9.Note:   As there is no stiffness associated to rotation about the normal axis to the plate, the rotational
degree of freedom must be constrained in order to prevent stiffness singularities.&lt;/p&gt;

CQUAD4  element forces and stresses are output in the element coordinate system. The element coordinate
system is established as follows:

The element may exhibit excessive stiffness, particularly for membrane strain. Thus, as a matter
of good modeling practice, CTRIA3s should be located away from areas of interest whenever
possible. In other respects, the CTRIA3 is analogous to the CQUAD4.

The element y-axis is perpendicular to the element x-axis, and the positive x-y quadrant contains
G3.

To model bending only, fill in MID2 only. For example,
To add transverse shear flexibility to bending, fill in MID2 and MID3. For example:
T ransverse shear flexibility MID3 adds a shear term in the element’s stiffness formulation. Therefore, a plate
element with an MID3 entry will deflect more (if transverse shear is present) than an element without an
MID3 entry. For very thin plates, this shear term adds very little to the deflection result. For thicker plates,
the contribution of transverse shear to deflection becomes more pronounced.
For a solid, homogeneous, thin, stiff plate, use MID1, MID2, and MID3 (all three MIDs reference the same
material ID). For example:

displacement output is shown in Listing 6-1.
Listing 6-1  Grid Point Displacement
Here are some checks and observations you can make in examining the deflections shown in Listing 6-1:
The maximum deflections of 3.796E-3 inches are due to the 0.5 lbf lateral loads and occur at grid
points 2 and 3 (the free edge), as expected.
The free edge deflections are identical since the structure and loadings are symmetric.
Grid points 1 and 4 have exactly zero displacement in all degrees of freedom, since they were
constrained to be fixed in the wall.
The lateral deflections occur in the T3 (+z) direction, which correspond with the direction of lateral
loading. These displacements are reported in the displacement coordinate system, not the element
coordinate system.
The maximum lateral deflection of 3.796E-3 inches is much less than the thickness of the plate
(0.15 in). Therefore, we are comfortably within the range of small displacement linear plate theory.

Other Surface Elements
Brief descriptions of MSC Nastran’s other surface elements are provided here for reference:
Solid Elements
MSC Nastran solid  (three-dimensional) elements are used to represent the behavior of thick plates and solids.
The principal solid elements are:
The six-sided CHEXA
The five-sided CPENTA
The four-sided CTETRACSHEAR Four-grid element that supports shear and extensional force only. Used
for analyzing thin reinforced plates and shells. Commonly used with
rod elements to analyze thin-skinned aircraft structures. Performs best
if kept rectangular.
CTRIA6 Isoparametric triangular element with three corner and three midside
grid points. Used for transitioning meshes in regions with curvature.
CQUAD8 Isoparametric element with four corner and four midside grid points.
Useful for modeling singly-curved shells (e.g., a cylinder). The
CQUAD4 element performs better for doubly-curved shells (e.g., a
sphere).
CTRIAR Three-grid isoparametric flat element. Companion to the CQUADR
element.
CQUADR Four-grid isoparametric flat plate element without membrane-bending
coupling. Better performance for modeling planar structures with in-
plane loads (i.e., membrane behavior). Less sensitive to distortion and
extreme values of Poisson’s ratio than the CQUAD4. Not
recommended for curved surfaces.
Note:   Solid elements have only translational degrees of freedom-no rotational DOFs are used to
define the solid elements.&lt;/p&gt;

Six-Sided Solid Element (CHEXA)
CHEXA
The CHEXA  element is recommended for general use. The CHEXA’s accuracy degrades when the element
is skewed. When it is used to simulate bending behavior it is important to take special precautions. In some
modeling situations, it has superior performance to other 3-D elements.
The CHEXA has eight corner grid points and up to twenty grid points if midside grid points are included.
Element stresses ( , , , , , and ) are calculated at the center, and are also extrapolated
out to the corner grid points. The element’s connection geometry is shown in Figure 6-15.

Figure 6-16  CHEXA Element Coordinate System
The CHEXA element coordinate system is defined in terms of vectors R, S, and T which join the centroids
of opposite faces.
The R vector joins the centroids of faces G4-G1-G5-G8 and G3-G2-G6-G7.
The S vector joins the centroids of faces G1-G2-G6-G5 and G4-G3-G7-G8.
The T vector joins the centroids of faces G1-G2-G3-G4 and G5-G6-G7-G8.
The origin of the coordinate system is located at the intersection of these vectors. The X, Y, and Z axes of the
element coordinate system are chosen as close as possible to the R, S, and T  vectors and point in the same
general direction.
Five-Sided Solid Element (CPENTA)
CPENTA
The CPENTA  element is commonly used to model transitions from solids to plates or shells. If the triangular
faces are not on the exposed surfaces of the shell, excessive stiffness can result.
The CPENTA element uses from six to fifteen grid points (six with no midside grid points; up to fifteen using
midside grid points). Element stresses ( , , , , , and ), are calculated at the center and
are also extrapolated out to the corner grid points. The element’s connection geometry is shown in Figure 6-17.

&lt;p&gt;The CPENTA element coordinate system is shown in Figure 6-18.
Figure 6-18  CPENTA Element Coordinate System
The origin of the CPENTA element coordinate system is located at the midpoint of the straight line
connecting the points G1 and G4. The Z axis points toward the triangle G4-G5-G6 and is oriented
somewhere between the line joining the centroids of the triangular faces and a line perpendicular to the
midplane. The midplane contains the midpoints of the straight lines between the triangular faces. The X and
Y axes are perpendicular to the Z axis and point in a direction toward, but not necessarily intersecting, the
edges G2 to G5 and G3 to G6, respectively.Note:   The continuations are not required if all midside nodes are deleted. Components of stress are
output in the material coordinate system. The material coordinate system is defined on the
PSOLID property entry.&lt;/p&gt;

Four-Sided Solid Element (CTETRA)
CTETRA
The CTETRA  solid element is used widely to model complicated systems (i.e., extrusions with many sharp
turns and fillets, turbine blades). The element has a distinct advantage over the CHEXA when the geometry
has sharp corners. For this situation it is possible to have CTETRAs that are much better shaped than
CHEXAs. However, it is important to use CTETRAs with ten grid points for all structural simulations (e.g.
solving for displacement and stress). The CTETRA with four grid points is overly stiff for these applications.
It is acceptable to use CTETRAs with four grid points for heat transfer applications.
The CTETRA has four grid points without midside nodes, or up to ten grid points with midside nodes.
Element stresses ( , , , , , and ), are calculated at the center, and are also extrapolated
out to the corner grid points. The element’s connection geometry is shown in Figure 6-19.

cannot be deleted. Components of stress are output in the material coordinate system. The
material coordinate system is defined on the PSOLID property entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;141 Chapter 6: Basic Element Library

The CTETRA element coordinate system is derived from the three vectors R, S, and T which join the
midpoints of opposite edges.
The R vector joins the midpoints of edges G1-G2 and G3-G4.
The S vector joins the midpoints of edges G1-G3 and G2-G4.
The T vector joins the midpoints of edges G1-G4 and G2-G3.
The origin of the coordinate system is located at G1. The element coordinate system is chosen as close as
possible to the R, S, and T vectors and points in the same general direction.
Solid Element Property (PSOLID)

FCTN in field 7 is only used for fluid elements.
Rigid Bar Element (RBE2)
As a general modeling principle, adjacent elements that differ greatly in relative stiffness (several orders of
magnitude or more) can cause numerical difficulties in the solution of the problem. For example, if a a CBAR
element with extremely large values of I1 and I2 is used to simulate a rigid connection, a numerically ill-
conditioned problem may occur. The RBE2 element defines a rigid body  whose independent degrees of
freedom are specified at a single point and the dependent degrees of freedom are specified at an arbitrary
number of points. The RBE2 element does not cause numerical difficulties . The RBE2 element is actually a
constraint element that prescribes the displacement relationship between two or more grid points.
The format of the RBE2 element entry is shown below:
Grid points 7 and 8 are at the ends of the CBAR element and lie along the stiffener’s neutral axis. An RBE2
element connects all six dependent degrees-of-freedom at grid point 7 (on the beam) to all six independent
degrees of freedom at grid point 1 (on the plate). There is a similar element at the other end of the beam.
Remember that an RBE2 element is not a finite element, but a set of equations that define a kinematic
relationship between different displacements.
The required RBE2 entries are written as follows:0Do not rotate

Basic Material Property Definitions
The description on basic material properties is limited to material that is linear , elastic, homogeneous , and
isotropic . In addition, we assume that the material is a continuum (contains no gaps or voids) and all material
properties remain constant. Many material properties are functions of temperature; thus, we infer that the
temperature of the structure is also constant.
Definitions of these restrictions and related material properties are described as follows:
Linear Deformation is directly proportional to the applied load (i.e., strain is directly
proportional to stress).
Elastic An elastic structure returns to its original, undeformed shape when the load is
removed.
Homogeneous The material has the same properties at every point; it is uniform without
irregularities. The material properties are independent of location within the
material.
Isotropic Material properties do not change with the direction of the material.
Young&amp;rsquo;s modulus
(Modulus of elasticity) E E is the constant of proportionality relating stress-to-strain for unixial behavior
in the linear region. The greater the value of E, the stiffer the material.
Shear modulus
(Modulus of rigidity) GG is the constant of proportionality relating shear stress to shear strain in the
linear region.
Poisson’s ratio  Poisson’s ratio is the absolute value of the ratio of lateral linear strain to axial
linear strain.&lt;/p&gt;

A typical stress-strain curve for structural steel is shown in Figure 7-1:
Figure 7-1  Stress-Strain Curve for Structural Steel
If the load on a structure is sufficient to exceed the linear elastic limit of the material, then nonlinear methods
are required to predict the nature of the plastic (permanently) deformed state. Refer to Nonlinear Analysis  for
further description. Nonlinear methods are also required if the material is nonlinear in its elastic range.

Description
A constraint is the application of a given displacement (i.e., component of translation or rotation) on a grid
point or points.
T wo basic types of constraints in MSC Nastran are:
Single point constraints (SPCs): A single point constraint is applied to an individual grid point.
Single point constraints can enforce either zero displacement or nonzero displacement
Multipoint constraints (MPCs): A multipoint constraint is a mathematical constraint relationship
between one grid point and another grid point (or set of grid points).
The boundary conditions of a static structure (fixed, hinged, roller support, etc.) normally involve various
degrees of freedom to be constrained to zero displacement. For example, consider a grid point fixed in a rigid
wall. All six displacement degrees of freedom: three translational directions and three rotational directions,
must be constrained to zero in order to mathematically describe the fixed boundary condition. Structural
reaction forces called single point constraint forces (SPCFs) may be recovered at grid points constrained by
SPCs and are listed in the . f06 output file.
Rigid body motion and mechanisms describe how the boundary conditions are used to prevent rigid body
motion. The presence of rigid body motion in MSC Nastran static analysis will cause the run to fail. Single
Point Constraints describe several ways to apply SPCs to grid points. Automatic Identification and Removal
of Singularities (AUTOSPC) describes how MSC Nastran automatically detects and constrains singularities
using a feature called AUTOSPC. Boundary condition examples gives several examples of modeling simple
boundary conditions.
Rigid Body Motion and Mechanisms
The equation  requires , the stiffness matrix, be nonsingular (the determinant of a
nonsingular matrix cannot be equal to zero). If any unconnected degrees of freedom exist in the model, the
stiffness matrix will be singular and the solution cannot proceed. Rigid body motion occurs when the
structure moves freely in one or more directions of displacement, (displacement without strain). Rigid body
motion causes singularities and must therefore be constrained.
Consider the two beams shown in Figure 10-1:
Figure 8-1  Rigid Body Motion vs. Adequate ConstraintsF Ku = K
F F
(a) Rigid Body Motion (b) Adequate Constraints&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;153 Chapter 8: Applying Constraints
Main Index
Static Equilibrium
The beam (a) shown in the Figure 8-1 is in static equilibrium. Displacement in the axial direction of the beam
does not occur because there are no actual forces acting on the beam to cause axial displacement. The
constraints shown in (a) are not adequate for MSC Nastran, which sees this structure as unstable since an
infinite number of displacement solutions are possible. MSC Nastran evaluates structural stability
independent of the applied load). The beam shown in (b) is adequately constrained.
Mechanisms
A subclass of rigid body motion occurs when part of an otherwise constrained structure is capable of rigid
body motion, called a mechanism. In linear static analysis, the presence of a mechanism also produces a
singularity failure in the solution.
Inertia Relief
A special technique called inertia relief is available to perform quasi-static analysis on unconstrained (free)
structures under uniform (i.e., zero or constant) acceleration. Examples of such structures include an aircraft
in flight or a satellite in orbit. Details on inertia relief is beyond the scope of this book; for further
information, refer to Inertia Relief  in the MSC Nastran Linear Static Analysis User’s Guide .
Single Point Constraints
Single point constraints (SPCs) are applied to the displacements of individual grid points. In this section we
shall discuss about applying SPCs using the GRID, SPC, and SPC1 Bulk Data entries.
Permanent Constraint on the GRID Entry
The GRID Bulk Data entry format is shown below:
An entry in field 8 (PS) defines permanent single point constraints associated with this grid point. You can
enter any combination of the integers 1 through 6 with no embedded blanks. Applying constraints directly
on the GRID entry is an easy method if only a few grid points in your model need to be constrained. The
constraints are in the displacement coordinate system of the grid point (i.e., the coordinate system defined
in field 7). It is not necessary to define a Case Control constraint set to use this method of applying
constraints.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
GRID ID CP X1 X2 X3 CD PS SEID&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Getting Started Guide 154
Main Index
Single Point Constraint (SPC)
The SPC Bulk Data entry is used to apply a set of single point constraints or enforced displacements (i.e.,
nonzero values of displacement) for static analysis. The format of the SPC entry is as follows:
One SPC entry can handle two sets of (G, C, D) values. The default value for enforced displacement (D) is
zero (i.e., for zero displacement, leave the field blank). Any number of SPC entries may be used to define a
set of constraints.
The constraints are specified in the grid point’s displacement coordinate system.
SID is the SPC set identification number and is selected in the Case Control Section with the command
SPC = SID
Automatic Identification and Removal of Singularities
(AUTOSPC)
MSC Nastran automatically identifies and constrains singularities in the stiffness matrix with the use of a
parameter called AUTOSPC. A grid point singularity table is printed in the output (. f06) file showing which
degrees of freedom were constrained. If this table is present in the output, it is critical that you inspect the
results carefully and understand which degrees of freedom were singular and why. It is possible that singular
degrees of freedom are due to modeling errors.
A sample grid point singularity table is shown in Figure 8-2. This table is from the single element cantilever
rod model in a simple MSC Nastran model.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Figure 8-2  Grid Point Singularity Table
In this table, grid point 2, the free end of the rod, failed (i.e. had no stiffness connection) in five of its six
possible degrees of freedom. Degree of freedom 2 (translation in the Y direction) of grid point 2 was not
singular and must, therefore, have been attached to something – the extensional stiffness of the rod in this
case. CROD elements support extension and torsion, but in this example no value of J, the torsional
constant, was provided in field 5 of the PROD element property entry. As a result, the CROD element had
no torsional stiffness, and the resulting unconnected degree of freedom was detected and constrained by
AUTOSPC.
For further information on singularities and the grid point singularity table, see Grid Point Weight Generator  in
the Linear Static Analysis User’s Guide .

constraints greatly influences the structure’s response to loading. Be cautious while you model
boundary conditions as accurately as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

Load Sets
The concept of sets-collections of entities of a particular type-is pervasive throughout MSC Nastran. Load
sets in linear statics problems are collections or lists of loads, selected by Case Control commands. The Case
Control command usage depends on the type of load or loads being applied. For the loads described in this
chapter, the general form of the Case Control command is either:
LOAD=n
or
DEFORM=n
Where n is an arbitrary user-defined set identification number (SID) in field 2 of the load Bulk Data entry.
All loads with the same SID are combined into a load set.
The applicability of each Case Control command is shown in the following table:
Concentrated Loads
This section shows how to apply concentrated forces  and concentrated moments at grid points.
Forces (FORCE)
Consider a force F acting on a cantilever beam:
A concentrated force F is applied to a CBAR element connecting grid points 1 and 2. The Bulk Data entry
required to specify this load is called FORCE . Its format is as follows:Case Control Command Bulk Data Entry
LOAD (Case) FORCE , FORCE1, FORCE2
MOMENT, MOMENT1 , MOMENT2
PLOAD , PLOAD1 , PLOAD2 , PLOAD4
GRAV*
LOAD*
SPCD*
DEFORM (Case) DEFORM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Special rules apply – see individual load descriptions for details.

ZF = 10 lbf
1 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;165 Chapter 9: Applying Static Loads
Main Index
In our example, the FORCE entry may be written in the tabular format as:
And, in the free field format as:
FORCE,2,2,,10.,0.,-1.,0.
The load set identification number (SID in column 2) refers to a command defined in the Case Control
Section (LOAD=2 in this example; the integer value 2 is arbitrarily chosen). Leaving column 4 blank means
that the basic (default) coordinate system is used to specify the orientation of the load. The (0., -1., 0.) entries
in columns 6, 7, and 8 refer to a vector in the -Y direction, defining the direction of application of the load.
The force applied to the grid point is , given by
(9-1)
where
Thus, the value of F in column 5 is the full value of the applied load of 10 lbf because vector  (in this
example) is of unit length.
MSC Nastran provides two other methods to apply a concentrated force:
The FORCE1 and FORCE2 entries are described in detail in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide . The
type of FORCE entry to use is simply a matter of preference.
Moments (MOMENT)
The application of concentrated moments  is analogous to forces. Consider moment M acting about the basic
Z axis of the simply supported beam shown below:Field Contents Value

As was the case with FORCE entry, M is the full magnitude of the moment since  is a vector of unit length.
The direction of the applied moment is given by the sign of M according to the right-hand rule because
is a vector in the direction of the positive Z axis direction. Specifying  and
would produce an equivalent result.
MSC Nastran provides two other methods to apply a concentrated moment:
The choice of which entry to use is a matter of preference.
Distributed Load on a 1-D Element (PLOAD1)
The PLOAD1  Bulk Data entry is used to apply a uniformly or linearly varying distributed  load to CBAR
and CBEAM elements.
The load can be applied along the entire element length, a segment of the length, or at a point along the
length. The form of the PLOAD1  entry is shown below. The meanings of X1, X2, P1, and P2 are shown in
Figure 9-1.
Format:MOMENT1Uses two grid points to determine direction ( , where  is a unit vector parallel
to the vector from grid 1 to grid 2).

The SCALE factors mean the following:
Additional details concerning projected loads can be found in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide  under
Bulk Data, PLOAD1  entry. We will concentrate on Length and Fractional loads.
The best way to demonstrate the use of PLOAD1 is with a few examples.LE LENGTH The values of Xi are the actual length of the element.
FR FRACTIONAL The values of Xi are fractional distances (fraction of length of
element) along the length of the element starting from end A.
LEPR LENGTH
PROJECTEDThe Xi values are actual distances along the element axis, and
the distributed load is input in terms of the projected length of
the element.
FRPR FRACTIONAL
PROJECTEDThe Xi values are ratios of the actual distance to the length of
the element, and the distributed load is specified in terms of
the projected length of the element.

Pressure Loads
Uniform Normal Pressure Load on Surface (PLOAD)
The PLOAD Bulk Data  entry is used to define a uniform normal static pressure load  on triangular or
quadrilateral surfaces by using grid points. The PLOAD  entry may be applied to 2-D (surface) or 3-D (solid)
elements, and has the following form:&lt;br&gt;
Grid Points G1, G2, G3, and G4 define either a triangular or quadrilateral surface; if G4 is zero or blank,
the surface is triangular. The direction of the pressure load is determined by applying the right-hand rule to
the grid point ordering sequence of the surface.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Uniform Normal Pressure Load on a 2-D Element (PLOAD2)
The PLOAD2 Bulk Data  entry is used to apply a normal uniform pressure load to CQUAD4 or CTRIA3 2-
D (surface) elements using element IDs.
The PLOAD2  entry has two forms:
Alternate form:
The load set ID (SID) is selected by the Case Control command LOAD=SID. The direction of the pressure
is determined using the connected GRID points in the same right-hand rule sense as the PLOAD entry (i.e., 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

elements must actually exist.
Normal or Traction Pressure Load on a Face (PLOAD4)
The PLOAD4 Bulk Data  entry defines a pressure load on the face of a variety of surface or solid elements.
The pressure load can either be normal to the surface, or contain a traction (not normal to the surface)
component. In addition, a different value of pressure can be entered at each corner. The PLOAD4 entry
applies to the following elements:

Alternate format (for surface elements):
The load set ID (SID) is selected by the Case Control command LOAD = SID. If P2, P3, and P4 are blank
fields, the load intensity is uniform and equal to P1; P4 is left blank for a triangular face. In addition, for
pressure that acts normal to the face, the continuation entry is not used. For details about how to apply
pressure loads in directions other than normal to the surface (traction loads) see the description of “PLOAD4 ”
on page 2529 of the .
The direction of positive pressure for surface elements is the positive normal, determined by applying the
right-hand rule to the sequence of grid points on the loaded face. Load intensities P1, P2, P3, (and P4) act
at corner points G1, G2, G3, (and G4) for triangular (and quadrilateral) elements. The default direction of
positive pressure for faces of solid elements is inward. In addition, when using the THRU option, all

Acceleration Loads (GRAV)
This section shows how to apply “static” acceleration  loads to your model. Examples of common static
acceleration loads are gravity  (the response of a structure to its own weight) and vehicle maneuver loads
(perhaps a pilot or an equipment package pulling g’s in a rapid turn). The acceleration causes a static load,
and not a dynamic one – the structural response is steady state (static) with the transient part being zero. In
all cases, both the magnitude of the acceleration and the direction in which it acts must be specified.
Acceleration is applied using the GRAV Bulk Data entry, which has the following format:1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Main Index
The direction and magnitude of acceleration are given by  where the vector&lt;br&gt;
gives the direction. The magnitude of  is equal to A times the magnitude of .
For models that have only GRAV loads, the load set ID (SID) is selected in the Case Control Section with a
LOAD = SID Case Control command. If other types of loads (such as FORCE or PLOAD) are also present
in the model, they must be combined with the GRAV load using a LOAD Bulk Data entry (see: “Combining
Loads (LOAD) ” on page 179 for more information on the LOAD Bulk Data entry).
Finally, the model must include mass density information to use acceleration loads. Mass density is entered
on the material property Bulk Data entry – MAT1 in our case. For example, for a model of typical structural
steel using English units, the mass density might be:
Hence, the MAT1 Bulk Data entry might look like the following:
See Material Definition (MAT1) , for further discussion of the MAT1 Bulk Data entry.
