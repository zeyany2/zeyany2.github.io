Introduction

Introduction
A cone-shaped flaring tool is pushed into a cylindrical tube to permanently increase the diameter of the tube end. The goal
of the analysis is to determine whether the final shape of the tube, after the entire process, meets the objective. The
nonlinear nature of the problem, along with the irreversible characteristics, makes it impossible to know in advance the
load required to drive the tool into the tube. As a result, multiple runs through the analysis cycle may be necessary to achieve
the final objective of the analysis.
This problem demonstrates the use of MSC Nastran SOL 400 to analyze a contact problem involving deformable-
deformable contact and large elastic-plastic deformations.
Solution Requirements
The requested solutions include the curve of the tube diameter at the right end as a function of loads and thedeformed
shape of the tube and the tool along with the distributions of von Mises stresses and plastic strains.
FEM Solutions
A numerical solution has been obtained with MSC Nastran’s SOL 400 for the element mesh (shown in Figure 14-1) using
axisymmetric elements.Element type 4-node axisymmetric elements
Contact  properties Friction between the tool and the tube is ignored in the analysis

unloading. One hundred (100) uniform time increments are used to solve each load steps. The stiffness matrix will be
updated at each iteration (full Newton-Raphson iteration strategy).

Results
The tube diameter at the right end of the tube gradually increases during the analysis as the load increases and reaches the
maximum of 0.4316 inches. The final tube radial displacement after unloading is settled at 0.4093 inches. See Figure 14-2
for the curve of tube diameter as a function of time (load). The entire analysis procedure can be repeated with various load
levels to achieve the desired final tube diameter. The curve is not smooth at the loading path because of the discrete finite
elements. It can be improved by refining the finite element meshes.&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction
A cylindrical cup drawing test is simulated with a circular punch and blank. The test is simulated for a 1 mm thick
aluminium sheet modeled by one-point shell elements and using an isotropic elasto-plastic material with work-hardening.
Only a quarter section of the cup is analyzed. A schematic view of the cup drawing process is shown in Figure 15-1. The
simulation demonstrates various capabilities available in MSC Nastran SOL 400 to simulate large strain processes including
robust and efficient shell elements, large strain material and geometric nonlinearity, and automated contact algorithms that
can handle large amounts of sliding and friction.

Solution Requirements
The contact forces on the rigid tools, workpiece, and the stress/plastic strain contours in the workpiece are of interest. The
availability of the large-strain shell elements in SOL 400 (by using suitable PSHLN1  extensions to the PSHELL  entry) are
demonstrated. Analytical rigid tools that capture curved geometries accurately are modeled and friction between the
workpiece and these rigid tools is simulated. The solutions presented include:
History plot of the contact forces acting on the rigid punch, die, and holder
Contact normal forces and friction forces acting on the workpiece
Plastic strain and equivalent stress contours in the workpiece
FEM Solutions
The contact, material/geometry, convergence and other parameters used for the cup drawing simulated herein are as
follows.
Contact Parameters
The contact bodies defined by BCBODY  and BSURF  are shown in Figure 15-2. The first body is the deformable workpiece; the
second, third and fourth bodies are the rigid punch, rigid die, and rigid holder, respectively.
The gap between the holder and die is 1 mm. All the rigid bodies are defined with analytical surfaces using the NURBS&lt;br&gt;
option. Friction coefficient is taken as 0.05 for all surfaces.

BCTABLE  with ID 1 is used in conjunction with the BCONTACT (Case) = 1  case control option to define the touching
conditions between the bodies in the forming step. Three sets of contact parameters are defined in the above table: the first
set for the workpiece-holder, the second set for the workpiece die, and the third set for the workpiece punch. The contact
parameters for all sets are identical in this problem though they can be varied for each set if needed. The friction coefficient
is defined as 0.05, the bias factor as 0.95, and the separation force as 50 N. The definition of a non-default separation force
bears more explanation - during the sheet forming process, especially at the early stages, nodes tend to chatter (contact,
separate, back into contact, etc.). Using the default separation force (maximum residual force in the solution) allows a
significant amount of chattering and leads to increased iterations and smaller steps. Specifying a larger separation force
reduces this chattering and reduces the number of iterations for the solution. It should be noted that care should be taken
in specifying the non-default separation force; it should not be so large that it prevents physical phenomena like earing, etc.

Note that ID 0 on the BCPARA  option indicates that the parameters specified herein are applied right at the start of the
analysis and are maintained through the analysis unless some of these parameters are redefined through the BCTABLE&lt;br&gt;
option. Important entries under BCPARA  option include FTYPE = 6  (bilinear Coulomb friction), BIAS = 0.95  (distance
tolerance bias), FNTOL = 50  (separation force). A program calculated default (1/4 of the shell thickness) is used for the
distance tolerance ( ERROR ) is not defined on the BCPARA  option.
Material/Geometry Parameters
An isotropic elasto-plastic material with work-hardening is used for the workpiece. MATBV  is used to define the elastic
properties and MATEP  in conjunction with TABLES1  is used to define the initial yield stress and work-hardening properties:

&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;
It should be observed that a 2 is used in the third field of the TABLES1  option to indicate that the data corresponds to stress
vs. plastic strain (as opposed to stress vs. total strain). Only the first line of the work-hardening data is indicated here. The
plastic strains are specified up to 1.0 in the actual table. The following should be noted: For the large strain problem being
simulated herein, TABLES1  data is interpreted by the program as Cauchy stress versus true plastic strain. Also, if the actual
plastic strains in the analysis exceed the maximum value in the table, the work-hardening slope calculated using the last two
values of plastic strain is used for extrapolating.
Reduced integration shell elements are used herein. They are identified by the PSHELL  option in conjunction with the
PSHLN1  option.

elements with a one-point quadrature scheme are able to undergo large rotations without any artificial correction for
warping. The large strain formulation for the element is flagged through the PARAM, LGDISP ,1 in conjunction with the
NLMOPTS ,LRGSTRN,1  bulk data entries. The former option indicates that a large displacement analysis with follower force
effects is to be conducted. The latter option indicates that additional large strain parameters are to be flagged for the shell
elements. Note that for large strain elasto-plastic applications using elements pointed by the PSHLN1 , PSLDN1 , PSHLN2  entries,
NLMOPTS,LRGSTRN,1  is a mandatory option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Demonstration Problems
FEM Solutions216
Main Index
As is customary for all Nastran shell elements, a material coordinate system is defined herein for each of the shell elements.
This orientation is defined through the THETA/MCID  option on the CQUAD4  option:
CQUAD4   19      1       40      22      3       4       0
CQUAD4   20      1       41      23      22      40      0
In the current example, the basic coordinate system (ID 0 indicated in red on the CQUAD4  options above) is projected
onto the plane of the element. The resulting axes define the X-Y-Z orientation of the material coordinate system in the
elemental plane.
Convergence Parameters
The nonlinear procedure used is defined through the NLPARM  entry:
NLPARM   1       100             PFNT    0       30      U       NO
where 100 indicates the total number of increments; PFNT  represents Full Newton-Raphson T echnique wherein the
stiffness is reformed at every iteration; KSTEP = 0  in conjunction with PFNT  indicates that the program automatically
determines if the stiffness needs to be reformed after the previous load increment is completed and the next load increment
is commenced. 30 is the maximum number of allowed recycles for every increment and. if this were to be exceeded, the
load step would be cut-back and the increment repeated. U indicates that convergence will be checked on displacements
(U). NO indicates that no intermediate output will be produced after every increment. The second line of NLPARM  is
omitted here, which implies that default convergence tolerances of 0.01 will be used for U checking. It should be noted
that, by default, the PFNT  checking used herein conducts displacement checking over incremental displacements and is
generally more stringent than FNT checking which conducts displacement checking over weighted total displacements.
Note that P checking (checking on residuals) has not been conducted in this example. The normal P check in SOL 400
compares the weighted residuals with the weighted external loads and checks that the tolerance (default = 0.01) is satisfied.
In this problem, external loads are absent since the punch imposes displacement boundary conditions on the workpiece.
Under these circumstances, SOL 400 normally checks residuals in the current iteration versus residuals in previous
iterations. However, due to frequent separations, residuals and displacements oscillate significantly and the check of current
weighted residuals versus previous weighted residuals causes a large number of unnecessary recycles. Due to these reasons,
displacement checking alone is conducted in this problem.
Case Control Parameters
Some of the case control entries to conduct these analyses are highlighted as follows: SUBCASE (Case)  1 indicates the case
being considered and STEP (Case) 1 indicates the step being considered within the case. BCONTACT = 1  is used to indicate
the contact parameters for SUBCASE 1 . NLPARM = 1  is used to flag the nonlinear procedure for SUBCASE 1 . In addition
to regular output requests like DISPLACEMENT (Case) S, STRESS  (Case) ES, the option that is required for contact related output
in the F06 file is BOUTPUT (Case) . It should be noted that with the BOUTPUT  option, one can obtain normal contact forces,
frictional forces, contact normal stress magnitudes and contact status for the contact nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

Results
The history plot of the rigid tool contact forces in the Z direction are presented in Figure 15-3. Two trends are noteworthy:
The contact forces are in equilibrium; i.e., the contact force exerted by the punch on the workpiece is in equilibrium with
the contact forces transferred by the workpiece to the holder and die. Note also that as the punch pushes the blank upwards
(+Z direction), the predominant tendency is for the sheet to contact the die. However, portions of the sheet separate from
the die and make intermittent contact with the holder.
In order to verify the accuracy of the SOL 400 solution, the total punch force obtained from SOL 400 is compared with
the corresponding solution obtained from Marc in Figure 15-4. It is seen that the history of the forces match quite well and
are within about 2% of each other.

The equivalent plastic strain contours at the outermost fiber of the workpiece and the corresponding equivalent stress
contours at the end of the cup forming process are plotted in Figure 15-5. It is noted that maximum plastic strains are of the
order of 45% and the peak values occur along the die radius. The portion of the workpiece held between the die and the
holder is the most highly stressed. Also, the circumferential variation of the quantities is negligible, thereby confirming the
axisymmetric nature of the problem being simulated. 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0

F06 Output
A number of case control options ( DISPLACEMENTS , SPCFORCES , STRESS , NLSTRESS , BOUTPUT ) are used (see
nug_16is.dat ). This, in conjunction with the YES or NO option for INTOUT  on the NLPARM  entry, allows extensive
output of relevant quantities in the F06 file:
•Contact normal forces, normal stresses and frictional forces at the contact nodes of the Workpiece are produced
via the BOUTPUT (Case)  option. BOUTPUT = ALL  produces output for all contact nodes. BOUTPUT = N  where
N is a set number would restrict output to only those contact nodes that belong to set N. BOUTPUT = NONE&lt;br&gt;
suppresses all contact related output in the F06 file.
•For the nonlinear output format (requested by NLSTRESS (Case) ), average values of the stress components, strain
components, equivalent stress, and equivalent plastic strain are produced for the top and bottom fibers. For each
layer, the integration point values are averaged over the number of integration points and presented in the F06
file. For the one-point elements used herein, the average is the same as the gauss point value. It should be noted
that for the large-strain elasto-plastic problem simulated herein using the NLMOPTS ,LRGSTRN,1  option, the
output stresses are the Cauchy stresses and the output strains are the logarithmic strains.

Modeling Tips
The PSHLN1  option in conjunction with the PSHELL  option allows the users to flag the 3 -D shell elements. These
elements perform well for large-displacement/large rotation/large strain applications. 3-noded or 4 -noded shell
topologies and thin-shell or thick-shell formulations can be chosen. 4-noded shell elements flagged through the C4
field of PSHLN1  offer options of thick-shell full integration, thick-shell reduced integration, and thin-shell full
integration. Reduced integration 4-noded elements are chosen in the present problem for efficiency and
robustness purposes.
For large strain elasto-plastic applications, use should be made of the NLMOPTS ,LRGSTRN,1  option to flag
appropriate element behavior.
In the present problem, the shell is supported between a die and holder. The uniform gap between the die and
holder matches the original thickness of the workpiece. Any increase in this thickness is prevented by the rigid
tools and normal stresses through the thickness would be introduced. This violates the plane stress assumption for
the shell element. For such double-sided applications, an alternate element to use is the solid shell element. This
element uses continuum element topology while offering the benefits of shell bending. It can be flagged through
the PSOLID  option in conjunction with the C8, BEH=SLCOMP , INT=ASTN  field on the PSLDN1  option.
For deformable-rigid body contact, an important consideration is the definition of the interior and exterior sides
of the rigid body. The rigid body should be aligned such that it’s exterior side is facing the contacting deformable
body. The interior side is the one formed by applying the right-hand rule along a rigid patch. If the rigid body is
incorrectly aligned, it needs to be flipped before running the analysis.

Introduction
This problem demonstrates MSC Nastran’s ability to perform multibody contact analysis, incorporating automated
double-sided contact with friction between the contact surfaces for linear plane strain elements. For these types of contact
problems, it is not necessary to assign either body as a primary o rsecondary.
Solution Requirements
The large displacement elastic-plastic contact analysis is carried out using MSC Nastran for a deformable-to-deformable
contact problem with friction. The application of the nonlinear plane strain element is demonstrated by using the
nonlinear extension PSHLN2  option along with the PLPLANE  option. The following results from the MSC Nastran model
are compared with the results obtained from the Marc model.
Deformed shapes at steps 10, 20 and 30
Contour plot for equivalent plastic strain
FEM Solutions
A numerical solution has been obtained with MSC Nastran’s SOL 400 for a 2-D representation of the contact simulation
between two deformable bodies. The details of finite element model, contact simulation, material, load, boundary
conditions, and solution procedure are discussed below.
Finite Element and Contact Model
The finite element mesh for each of the two deformable bodies contains 60 elements and 79 nodes. MSC Nastran’s 2 -D
plane strain solid elements with material ID 1 are selected using the following PLPLANE  and PSHLN2  entries. The second line
of the PSHLN2  option enables SOL 400 to access the 4-node plane strain elements using the regular CQUAD4  elements. This
element can be used for both linear and nonlinear applications. When used for linear applications, the assumed strain
formulation should be activated for this element using the NLMOPTS ,ASSM,ASSUMED  bulk data entry to get good bending
behavior. This assumed strain option should not be used for the applications involving large strain plasticity as in the case
of the present problem. The finite element model used for this simulation is shown in Figure 16-1.

In defining the contact model, the elements comprising the deformable bodies are used to generate a deformable contact
bodies with ID 1 and 2 using the following BCBODY  and BSURF  entries. The friction factor of 0.07 is defined for both these
contact bodies.

&amp;hellip;
Furthermore, the following BCTABLE  entries identify how these bodies can touch each other. BCTABLE  with ID 0 is used
to define the touching conditions at the start of the analysis. This is a mandatory option required in SOL 400 for contact
analysis and is flagged in the case control section through the optional BCONTACT (Case) = 0  option. The BCTABLE  with
ID 1 is used to define the touching conditions for later increments in the analysis and is flagged using BCONTACT = 1 in
the case control section. The 0 defined for the first field ( ISEARCH ) of third data line of BCTABLE  indicates that double-
sided contact will be used for this contact pair. With this double contact option, SOL 400 will consider another contact
pair for the analysis with body 1 as primary a nd body 2 as secondary i n addition to the contact pair defined in the BCTABLE&lt;br&gt;
option.

Important entries under BCPARA  option include FTYPE  – the friction type and the BIAS  - the distance tolerance bias. As
a general recommendation, BIAS  is set to 0.9 (note that the default value of BIAS  is 0.9). For the frictional case, FTYPE&lt;br&gt;
is set to 6 (bilinear Coulomb model).

Solution Procedure
The nonlinear procedure used is defined through the following NLPARM  entry:
NLPARM   1       30              PFNT            25      P       YES
0.01                         &lt;br&gt;
where 30 indicates the total number of increments; PFNT  represents Pure Full Newton-Raphson Technique wherein the
stiffness is reformed at every iteration; KSTEP = 0  in conjunction with PFNT  indicates that the program automatically
determines if the stiffness needs to be reformed after the previous load increment is completed and the next load increment
is commenced. 25 is the maximum number of allowed recycles for every increment. P indicates that convergence will be
checked on residuals ( P). YES indicates that intermediate output will be produced after every increment. The 0.01 defined
in the second line of NLPARM  indicates the convergence tolerances of 0.01  for residual checking.
Results
The deformed shape at steps 10, 20, and 30 observed from both Marc and SOL 400 models are compared in Figure 16-4.
The equivalent plastic strain contours observed at step 30 from Marc and SOL 400 runs are presented in Figure 16-5 and
Figure 16-6. It is clearly observed from these pictures that, the predictions from SOL 400 matches closely with the
predictions from Marc.
Modeling Tips
PSHLN2  entry in conjunction with regular PLPLANE  entry allows the users to make use of the plane strain elements
using regular Nastran elements CQUAD4  CQUAD8 , and CTRIA6 . Users should make use of the NLMOPTS ,LRGS,1  option
to flag the large strain behavior of these elements.
The value of 0 for ISEARCH  parameter in BCTABLE  defines the double sided contact for this problem. Assigning
the value of 1 for ISEARCH  parameter will define single sided contact for this problem, and this will not work
properly in this case. The nug_17w.dat  input file shows this wrong way of contact definition for this problem
and Figure 16-7 shows how SOL 400 works in such situations.&lt;/p&gt;

The deformable contact body is simply a collection of mutually exclusive elements and their associated nodes. The rigid
cylindrical body is defined using 2-D NURBS line.
Furthermore, the BCTABLE  entries shown below identify that these bodies can touch each other. Since the primary b ody is
a rigid one, this actually means that the deformable body is the secondary o ne.

removed immediately. It is done using BCMOVE  option. To prevent the two bodies cylinder reclaims contact, a new BCTABLE&lt;br&gt;

Here the PFNT  option is selected to update the stiffness matrix during every recycle using the Newton -Raphson iteration
strategy, and the default displacement convergence tolerances will be used.
The simulation process is controlled by the case control section. The first STEP (Case)  is the forming process and the second

Force control applied via a control node associated with the rigid cylinder may be used instead of displacement (or
equivalently velocity) control. Using this technique, the release of the load requires less difficulty with the contact table
(please see nug_18b.dat ). In terms of CPU time, removing the rigid body from contact table is more efficient since there
is no need to do contact manipulation (please see nug_18c.dat ).

Introduction
This problem demonstrates the ability to perform metal forming analyses. A rigid cylinder is pressed into an elastic-plastic
material and, in the second loading stage, it is rolled. Large plastic deformation is anticipated in this analysis.
Solution Requirements
To model this large plastic deformation, additive plasticity with mean normal return is used. This is activated in MSC
Nastran using the NLMOPTS  bulk data entry, nonlinear material options, and then choosing LRGSTRN,1 . T ogether with
this option, nonlinear property extensions for the PSOLID  entry should be used. This can be done by activating the
PSLDN1  bulk data entry and selecting the required properties.
FEM Solution s
A numerical solution has been obtained with MSC Nastran’s SOL 400 for the element mesh ( Figure 18-1) using solid
elements defined by BCBODY  and BSURF  entries (contact body ID 1). The dimensions of the workpiece are 20 x 10 x 12
inches. The radius of the cylinder is 10 inches, the width 18 inches, and the cylinder is placed on top of the workpiece at

The rigid cylinder (contact body 2) is load controlled. This means that two nodes define the motion of the rigid. One node
defines the translational degrees of freedom and one node defines the rotational degrees of freedom. The motion of the
cylinder is first in the -z-direction, and, after this, it rolls around its y-axis in the x-direction. This motion is prescribed by
defining two analyses steps and using SPCD entries. Node 227 is for the translational motion, and node 226 for the
rotational motion. Note that in step 2, the cylinder rotates both around the y-axis and moves in the x-direction, making a
rolling movement.

Introduction
This example models a honeycomb (core) structure with a face sheet between which exists an initial delamination. A hole
is drilled in the core part, where a prescribed displacement is applied to the face sheet in order to study the effect of
delamination of the face from the core.
A plane strain assumption has been used and, for simplicity, the same isotropic material is used for the two parts.
The delamination is modeled in two ways:
•With glued contact and crack growth using the VCCT  option.
•With interface elements using a cohesive zone model.
Figure 19-1 illustrates the VCCT model. The face sheet is glued to the core. The center part of the face sheet is omitted from
the contact body and thus defines the initial cracks. The grid IDs defining the crack tips are shown in Figure 19-2.Element type 4-node plane strain; 4-node interface

Figure 19-1  Definition of Contact Bodies for the VCCT Model
The model using interface elements is shown in Figure 19-3. Here, we do not use contact; instead, there are interface
elements between the core and the face which share the grids from the existing meshes. The interface elements have zero
thickness, but they are shown with finite thickness in Figure 19-3 (the face part has been moved downwards for better
illustration).
For the VCCT model, a crack growth resistance is specified. The energy release rate is calculated for each crack at each load
level. When this energy release rate is larger than the crack growth resistance, the crack will grow. The growth is
accomplished by releasing the glued contact at the crack tip. The next grid along the interface is automatically identified
and a new calculation of the energy release rate is performed, and the check for growth repeated. This continues at constant
load until either the crack reaches a free boundary or the energy release rate is below the crack growth resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

Solution Requirements
Main Index
With the interface elements and the cohesive material model, the growth of the delamination occurs by increased damage
in the interface elements. Damage could occur at any point along the interface, but in this case, the largest stresses occur
where the initial delamination ends, so the largest damage will happen here. When the interface elements have sustained
full damage at all integration points, they no longer contribute to the stiffness of the structure.
Solution Requirements
Requested results are the force-displacement curve of the point where the prescribed displacement is applied and the
amount of growth of the initial delamination.

Results
The deformed shape at the final load for the two cases is shown in Figure 19-4. It can be seen that the amount of growth of
the delamination is the same for the two models. The cohesive zone variant shows the “stretched” interface elements. They
are, at this point, fully damaged and do not contribute to the structural stiffness.
Figure 19-5 shows a plot of the reaction force versus the prescribed displacement. Here, we clearly see the difference between
the two approaches. For VCCT, the interface is rigid until crack growth occurs. The jumps in the reaction force indicate
when a new node is released. With a finer mesh, the curve would be smoother. The cohesive zone model shows a different
behavior. The initial stiffness is lower as a result of the properties of the cohesive material. Here the interface layer is
relatively soft, and the growth of the delamination is smooth. By adjusting the properties of the cohesive material one can
adjust the initial stiffness of the interface layer. Thus, the VCCT approach models the interface as rigid while the interface
element approach models an elastic interface with initially zero thickness.
The values used for the crack growth resistance and the cohesive energy are the same in the two model. This makes sense
since these quantities are related – both correspond to the energy needed to break the connection.

Modeling Tips
Both models could be done with higher-order elements for increased accuracy. When glued contact is released in the VCCT
model, the midside grid is released whenever a corner grid is released. Hence, although this would give an increased general
accuracy of the solution, it would not improve the jagged nature of the force-displacement curve.
Some notes on mesh design. In the VCCT model, the meshes on both sides of the glued interface have matching nodes.
One of the two grids at the crack tip is identified in the VCCT  input. It does not matter which one of the two that is used.
It is allowed to use nonmatching meshes for VCCT based crack growth. Figure 19-6 shows an example. Here, the bottom
part is glued to the top part (the bottom part is the touching side and the top part the touched side). In this case, it is
important that the grid of the touching part is chosen for the VCCT  input. This is the grid that would be released in case
of crack growth. The touching part should be the part with a finer mesh density.
The current interface element model does not use contact. The interface elements and the other elements share nodes. In
order to allow a model with independent meshes, one can also use glued contact here. See Figure 19-7 for an example. The
interface elements are shown with finite thickness for clarity. The top part of the interface elements are glued to the top
part of the model and the bottom part of the interface elements to the bottom part. This way, all three parts can be modeled
independently. Similar to the VCCT example above, the touching body (in this case the interface elements) should have a
finer mesh density.0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2

Introduction
A small and a large steel plate are bolted together. Initially, the smaller plate is in full contact on one side with the larger
plate. The opposite side of the smaller plate is supported. Furthermore, the bolt head is touching the larger plate and the
nut is glued to the smaller plate. It is assumed that the material  behavior for both the plates and the bolt is linear elastic.
In the first load step, the bolt is fastened by applying a pre-tension force ( ) to the bolt  in the basic Z-direction.
In three subsequent load steps, the bolt is locked (that is, further shortening of the bolt is suppressed) and the plates are
subjected to cyclic loads. T wo types of loads will be presented: a mechanical load that consists of a uniform pressure equal
to  applied to the larger plate and a thermal load in which temperature of the plates is increased by
.

T wo solutions, one involving a uniform pressure equal to  applied to the larger plate and one involving
a temperature increase by  of the two plates, are:

That the bolt force increases with increasing temperature of the plates, due to thermal expansion
The analysis results are presented with linear elements.
Bolt Modeling
In various engineering applications, it is necessary to define a pre-stress in, for example, bolts or rivets before applying any
other structural loading. A convenient way do this is via multi-point constraints. The idea is to split the element mesh of
the bolt across the shaft in two disjoint parts, such that duplicate grid points appear at the cut, and to connect the duplicate
nodes again by multi-point constraints (see Figure 20-1). The constraints are chosen such that an overlap or a gap can be
created between the two parts in a controllable way. If the motion of the parts is somehow constrained in the direction in
which the gap or overlap is created, then an overlap (a “shortening” of the bolt) will introduce a tensile (pre-)stress in each
of the parts and a gap (an “enlongation” of the bolt) will result in a compressive stress.
The multi-point constraints have one secondary a nd two primary g rid points. The secondaries  are the grid points at the
cut from the bottom part of the bolt (see Figure 20-1). The first primary g rids are the corresponding grid points from the
top part of the bolt on the other side of the cut. The second primary i n the constraints is a unique third grid point, called
the control grid point of the bolt. This is often a free grid point (that is, not part of the element mesh) and is shared by all
multi-point constraints on the cut.

Constraints.

in which ,  and  are the displacement degrees of freedom of a grid point from the bottom part, its
corresponding grid from the top part and the control grid point, respectively. It immediately follows from this equation
that  is the displacement difference of the bottom and top grids and is equal to the size of the overlap or gap
between the parts. Hence, by enforcing the displacements of the control grid point, an overlap or gap of a particular size
can be created between the two parts.
It can be shown (see, for instance, Marc Volume A: Theory and User Information, Chapter 9, Section “Overclosure Tying” ),
that if the multi-point constraints are set up as outlined above, the force on the control grid point equals the sum of the
forces on the grid points from the bottom part as well as minus the sum of the forces on the grid points from the top part:
.
Hence, the force on the control grid point is the total force on the cross-section of the bolt. By applying a (pre-tension)
force to that grid point, the total force on the cross-section can be prescribed. Moreover, if the shortening of the bolt is
prescribed via an enforced displacement on the control grid point, then the reaction force on that grid point is equal to the
total force on the cross-section of the bolt.
Note that both types of boundary conditions on the control grid point can be combined in a single analysis as demonstrated
in this example. In the first load step, the pre-tension force will be applied to the control grid point of the bolt. This results
in a certain amount of shortening of the bolt. At the end of the first load step, the amount of shortening is recorded and is
kept constant in subsequent load steps, via a single point constraint on the control grid point.

There are two ways to define the multi-point constraints for bolt modeling in the bulk data: each constraint can be defined
explicitly via the MPC  option or the entire set of constraints can be defined via the BOLT  option. The latter has been
designed specially for bolt modeling and has several advantages over explicit MPC s:
Provides a much more concise input than explicit MPC s;
Generates all the required multi-point constraints on all displacement and rotational degrees of freedom
automatically;
Ensures continuity of the temperature field across the cut in the thermal passes of coupled analyses;
Requires no special provisions in a contact analysis (see below).
FEM Solutions
A numerical solution has been obtained with MSC Nastran’s SOL 400 for the element mesh shown in Figure 20-2 using 3-D
solid linear elements. The bolt and the nut are assumed to be rigidly connected and are modeled as a single physical body.
To fasten the bolt, the element mesh of the bolt is split into two parts across the shaft and the 41 grid point pairs on both
sides of the cut are connected by multi-point constraints of the form discussed in the preceding section. Grid ID 1903 acts
as the control grid of the bolt.
Two versions of the input are considered. In the first version, the BOLT option is used to generate the multi-point constraints
on the cut. In the second version, the constraints are defined explicitly via the option.
The BOLT option requires a bolt ID (5000), the ID of the control grid of the bolt (1903) and the grids at the cut from the
top and bottom parts of the bolt. The latter must be entered pair-wise in the TOP and BOTTOM  section of the option: the
i-th TOP grid should correspond to the i-th BOTTOM  grid.

Contact
The main problem with the use of explicit MPC s is that in a contact analysis, the constraints may conflict with the multi-
point constraints due to contact. Special provisions have to be made in the contact setup to avoid that the secondary g rids
of the MPC s can come in contact with other contact bodies. Furthermore, due to the cut in the mesh, it is difficult for grid
points of other contact bodies that touch the bolt surface, to slide across the cut from the bottom part of the bolt to the
top part or vice versa. The BOLT  option addresses both issues, provided that the two parts of the bolt are in the same contact
body. Conflicts with contact constraints are avoided and grid points that touch the surface of the bolt can slide without
difficulties across the cut.
For the present model, the two methods are compared. T o avoid problems in the MPC  version between the explicit MPC s
and the contact constraints, the radius of the bolt shaft is slightly smaller than the radius of the holes in the plates, such
that contact between the shaft and plates will not occur.
The three physical components of the model (the two plates and the bolt with the nut) have been selected as contact bodies
defined by BCBODY  and BSURF . The contact bodies are identified as the set of elements in the respective components:

The first contact body (bolt and nut) must be selected as the secondary ( or contacting) body. Since the contact
algorithm detects contact between the grid points at the surface of the secondary ( or contacting) body and the
faces of the elements at the surface of the primary ( or contacted) body, the body with the finer element mesh in
the contact region generally should be selected as the secondary b ody and the body with the coarser mesh as the
primary,  as this results in “more points in contact” and thus a better description of the contact conditions than
with the opposite definition. The ISEARCH  entry is set to 1 to force search order from the secondary b ody to the
primary.
The bolt can touch the plates and the plates can touch each other.
The IGLUE  entry is set to 1 for contact between the nut and the smaller plate to activate glued contact conditions
(that is, no sliding and no separation) between these two contact bodies.

Loads, Boundary Conditions and Load Steps
The loading sequence consists of four load steps. In the first load step. The pre-tension force in the basic Z direction is
applied to the control grid point of the bolt via a FORCE  option, as follows:
$ bolt-force
FORCE    1       1903    0      200.     0.      0.     1.
At the end of the load step, the shortening of the bolt due to the applied pre-tension force is recorded and kept constant in
subsequent load steps by a single-point constraint on the displacement of the control grid in the basic Z direction using a
SPC1:
$ bolt-lock
SPC1     5       3       1903
Throughout the analysis, the displacements of the control grid in the basic X and Y directions are suppressed by a single-
point constraint:
$ bolt-xy
SPC1     4       12      1903
In all four load steps, the full load is applied in a single increment. The nonlinear procedure NLPARM  used in the load steps is:
NLPARM   1       1               PFNT    1       50      UP      NO&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;   .01     .01
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;   0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the PFNT  option is selected to activate the pure Newton-Raphson iteration strategy. Convergence of the non-linear
iteration process is checked on both displacements and forces, using tolerances equal to 0.01.
Results
The shortening of the bolt due to the pre-tension force applied in the first load step is listed in Table 20-1. The solution
obtained with an equivalent Marc 2005 model is included for reference. This shortening is recorded at the end of the first
load step and kept fixed in the subsequent load steps. It is apparent from this table that the MPC version and the BOLT
version produce identical results.
Pressure Load
The pressure load is applied in a cyclic fashion to the large plate in the final three load steps. The plate is loaded in load
steps 2 and 4 and unloaded in load step 3. The deformed structure plot (magnification factor 500) as well as the equivalent Table 20-1  Bolt Shortening During Fastening in the First Load Step

In Figure 20-4, the MSC Nastran solution (blue dots) is compared with the solution obtained by Marc (the solid line). The
good agreement between the two solutions is apparent.
This plot demonstrates the well-known fact that the bolt force is unaffected by the pressure applied to the plate. Due to a
slight bending of the larger plate under the pressure load, however, the bolt force is not exactly constant.
Thermal Load
The thermal load is applied in a cyclic fashion to both plates. The plates are heated in load steps 2 and 4 and cooled down
in load step 3. The deformed structure plot (magnification factor 100) as well as the equivalent von Mises stress distribution
at the end of the final load step are shown in  Figure 20-5. A plot of the bolt force in the basic Z direction is shown in
Figure 20-6. Again, the MSC Nastran solution (blue dots) is compared with the solution obtained by Marc (the solid line)
and the agreement of the two solutions is apparent.

Figure 20-6  Bolt Forces During Loading Cycle by Thermal Load.
In this load case, the bolt force increases with increasing temperature due to thermal expansion of the plates. It decreases
again to the pre-stress force after cooling down.
Modeling Tips
Multi-point constraints provide a convenient way to fasten bolts. Either the shortening of the bolt or the total force in the
cross-section of the bolt can be controlled via enforced displacements or forces on the control grid point of the bolt. These
two types of boundary conditions can be combined in one simulation in which the bolt is first pre-stressed and then loaded
by other mechanical or thermal loads.
The BOLT  option provides a convenient way to generate the required multi-point constraints. It can be used conveniently
in a contact analysis, provided that the two parts of the bolt are in the same contact body.

Introduction
A belt is positioned around a pulley such that a 90o section of the pulley is contacted. One end of the belt is fixed; the other
end is loaded by a tensile force with magnitude . It is assumed that the material behavior for both the belt
and the pulley is linear elastic. Although this problem can be solved by a 2-D approximation, a full 3-D model is chosen
here in order to show the characteristic behavior of 3-D parabolic hexahedral elements in a contact analysis involving
friction. An analytical  solution for the case with Coulomb friction is known.
Solution Requirements
Analyses will be carried out for three different values of the friction coefficient: , , and .
With a constant value of the applied load, the reaction force will decrease for increasing values of the friction coefficient.
This reaction force is the primary requested quantity, as this can be easily compared with an analytical solution.
Analytical Solution
Assuming Coulomb friction between the belt and the pulley, the principle of rope friction according to the Euler-Eytelwein
formula provides a relation between the magnitude  of the applied force, the magnitude  of the reaction force, the
angle  spanned by the belt and the friction coefficient  between the belt and the pulley:
With  and , the theoretical value of the magnitude of the reaction force  is listed in Table 21-1
for various values of the friction coefficient .

Numerical solutions have been obtained with MSC Nastran’s SOL 400 for the element mesh shown in Figure 21-1 using 3-
D 20-node hexahedral elements. Assuming that the deformations of the pulley are small and localized around the contact
area, only an 180o section has been modeled. In total, there are five contact bodies: two deformable and three rigid. The
rigid bodies will be used to easily apply the boundary conditions (single point constraints and forces).

The first deformable body consists of all elements of the belt, where the second deformable body consists of all elements
of the pulley. The body number ID’s of the belt and the pulley are 1 and 2, respectively. These deformable contact bodies
are defined by BCBODY  entries and identified as 3-D bodies referring to the BSURF  IDs 1 and 2:

of the pulley. Its body ID number is 3 and it is identified as:

The second and the third rigid bodies are load controlled rigid bodies. A load controlled rigid body is associated with a
control grid, which can be used to apply forces and/or single point constraints. In the current analysis, two flat load
controlled rigid bodies are used. They will be glued to both ends of the belt and their control grids will be used to prevent
a rigid body motion in the basic z-direction, to apply the external force on the belt and to transfer the belt load to the fixed
control grid. The load controlled rigid bodies are identified as:

The first SECNDRY PRIMARY  combination indicates that the grids of deformable body 1 are treated as secondary g rids
when contact is established with body 2. The friction coefficient is set to 0.05.
The other SECNDRY PRIMARY  combinations activate glued contact between the bodies with body ID numbers 1 and
5, 1 and 4, and 2 and 3, respectively.
The bilinear Coulomb friction model will be activated using the BCPARA  option (FTYPE = 6); this option is also used to
indicate that the separation behavior is based on stresses (IBSEP = 4), which is necessary in a contact analysis involving
quadratic elements:

In order to activate the full nonlinear formulation of the 20 node hexahedral elements, the nonlinear property extension
of the PSOLID , PSLDN1  entry is used. For the materials defining the belt using MATBV  (material ID number 1) and the pulley
(material ID number 2), this results in:
MAT1     1      1.+9            .3      1.

Here the FNT  option is selected to update the stiffness matrix during every recycle using the full Newton -Raphson iteration
strategy. Convergence checking is performed based on displacements, forces and work. The error tolerance is set to 10-4
for all criteria. Note that the MAXDIV  field is set to 10 to avoid that bisections occur, since too many bisections may increase
the overall solution time.

The obtained values of the reaction forces are listed in Table 21-2, together with the relative error compared to the analytical
solution. The numerical and analytical solutions turn out to be in good agreement.

Convergence Behavior
A nonlinear analysis involving contact and friction may need several iterations to fulfil the convergence requirements. In
such inherently nonlinear analyses, it may be advantageous to increase the number of criteria needed to force a bisection.
As discussed above, this number ( MAXDIV  on the NLPARM  option) has been set to 10 instead of the default value 3. The
tables below show the convergence behavior with the increased value ( Table 21-3) and the default value ( Table 21-4). The
increased value clearly reduces the overall number of Newton-Raphson iterations and thus the analysis wall time. When
looking at Table 21-3, iteration 9 reaches displacement, load and work errors which are within the required tolerances. The
extra iterations needed are caused by the fact that some grids of the belt which are initially in contact with the pulley,
separate because of tensile contact stresses. After separation of these grids, a new solution with a smaller number of contact
constraints has to be found.

Introduction
The interference fitting of a valve insert into a cylinder head recess is to be simulated. The general arrangement is shown
in Figure 22-1. The compressive interference between the valve insert external radius and the cylinder head valve recess
opening is 0.05 mm. Only a portion of the relatively stiff cylinder head is modeled. An approximate analytical solution for
the stress in the valve insert can be found from a deformation analysis of thick-walled cylinders subject to symmetric
external loading.

Solution Requirements
A single solution is sought  and the average hoop and radial stresses in the valve insert are compared to athick cylinder
solution assuming the cylinder head is rigid. Comparison plots include average hoop and radial stresses plotted along the
radial distance from the value center for the predicted and analytic solutions.
Analytical Solution
An estimate for the hoop and radial stresses in the valve insert can be obtained from the analytical solution of a two-
dimensional plane stress (axial stress assumed to be zero) thick walled cylinder with prescribed displacement on its external
radius. The analytical solution assumes the cylinder head is rigid and the radial displacement of the insert at its external
radius is equal to the interference fit.
The thick walled cylinder solution only varies with radius, , where the radial displacement, , becomes the solution of
or . The stresses are then determined from the radial displacement as,
subjected to the boundary conditions,  and
.
This yields the analytic solutions of

Results
Figure 22-3 plots the FEA and analytical solutions for the hoop and radial stresses in the valve insert against the radius from
the valve center. An arbitrary cross-section (high noon position of Figure 22-1) of the valve insert along the free surface was
chosen to pick the FEA stresses. The results of the analytical and FEA solutions are in general agreement.

Several factors may have contributed to the difference in results. The analytical solution assumes a perfectly shaped insert
with prescribed displacements on the outside radius. On the other hand, the portion of the cylinder head that is modeled
using FEA is a nonsymmetric deformable body, which makes the FEA results slightly nonuniform across the circumference
as shown in Figure 22-4. The valve insert is in contact with the cylinder head not only across the insert&amp;rsquo;s cylindrical surface
but across its bottom surface as well. In addition, the shape of the cross-section of the valve seat disc has a slant edge on its
top free surface.15 16 17 18 19 20 21

Figure 22-4  Slightly Nonuniform Hoop Stress in Valve Insert
Modeling Tips
This application example holds the insert in position by contact and friction. Take out friction, and the insert may (or may
not) pop out - in which case, the best thing is to add some soft springs, or a very small amount of friction to hold it in place
in the axial direction. Using the parabolic tetrahedral elements allows for good contact detection of the cylindrical surface
which yields a very smooth contact condition between the two bodies.
If the interference distance is small compared to the element size, the default contact tolerances will probably be ok;
however, it is possible that the interference fit will end up larger than the contact distance tolerance and contact will be
missed (one reason for a spotty stress plot). The remedy is to specify a distance tolerance equal to the interference fit for
the contact pair in the table, as well as a bias of 0.99 in general.

Introduction
This problem demonstrates the ability of MSC Nastran SOL 400 to do a frictional contact problem. An ostensibly simple
geometry poses a substantial challenge for the contact algorithm due to the large sliding involved between the two
deformable bodies. Sudden changes in the motion path pose a challenge to the ability of the contact algorithm to correctly
place the node on the contact surface while respecting the various geometric details in the problem.
Due to large bending stresses in the deformed configuration, assumed strain formulation is used with the 8 -node
hexahedral elements. The material is elastic and the original geometry without residual stresses is recovered upon the
complete removal of the loading.
From elementary strength of materials analysis, the tip deflection for beam bending can be written as:
where  is the applied load,  is the length of the beam,  is the moment of inertia and  is the Young’s modulus. The
normal stress along the beam cross section varies in the thickness direction as:
where  is the moment and  is the thickness coordinate. It must be noted that the above solution only holds for small
displacements and uniform cross section.
Solution Requirements
A numerical solution has been obtained with MSC Nastran’s SOL 400 for a 3-D representation of a belt buckle with a
deformable-to-deformable contact between the two pieces of the buckle. The details of finite element model, contact
simulation, material, load, boundary conditions, and solution procedure are discussed below.

The ANALYSIS (Case)  contains a single SUBCASE (Case)  with two steps. The two STEP (Case) s comprise of individual load
sequences consisting of insertion (clipping) and removal of the belt buckle. Each step has a definition of convergence

Large displacement effects are included in the nonlinear analysis using the LGDISP option:
PARAM    LGDISP  1
While the assumed strain formulation is flagged using the NLMOPTS  option:
NLMOPTS,ASSM,assumed
The NLMOPTS  field triggers the assumed strain formulation which provides a better bending behavior of the continuum
elements. This alleviates the difficulty associated with spuriously large shear stresses induced due to bending moment. The
LGDISP  field indicated the use of large displacement, large rotation kinematics of the element. This is adequate when the
analysis consists of Hookean elastic material; however, incase of large deformation plasticity or other inelastic models, the
LRGSTRN  parameter should be used in the NLMOPTS  option (for more details on its usage, please refer to Chapter :
Chapter 3: 3-D Sheet Metal Forming  of this manual).&lt;/p&gt;

Element Modeling
Besides the standard options to define the element connectivity and grid coordinate location, the bulk data section contains
various options which are especially important to do nonlinear analysis.
The nonlinear extensions to lower -order solid element, CHEXA  can be activated by using the PSLDN1  property option to the
regular PSOLID  property option in the manner shown below:
PSOLID   1       1       0
PSLDN1   1       1       1                                             +&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C4        SOLI       L                                             +
The PLSLDN1  option allows the element to be used in both large displacement and large strain analysis and has no
restrictions on the kinematics of deformation unlike the regular CHEXA  elements with only PSOLID  property entry. The
standard CHEXA  elements are more suitable for large rotations but small strain analysis due to their linear formulation in
co-rotational system. While the difference may be small or even negligible in elastic analysis, use of any inelastic material
model would certainly require the use of these options.
Modeling Contact
The BCPARA  defines the number of bodies in contact with maximum number of contact entities (e.g., patches), nodes on
the periphery of the contact surfaces and contact parameters like friction type (in this case – node based, bilinear Coulomb
model), friction coefficient, bias factor, and type of contact procedure used.
BCPARA         0ERROR      0.005BIAS        0.99FTYPE          6 &lt;br&gt;
It must be mentioned that the contact procedure being used (flagged via ISPLIT  flag) is iterative penetration checking
procedure and must always be used for robustness in a quasi-static analysis.
Friction has been flagged via the FTYPE  field where a 6 denotes the bilinear, Coulomb model. The friction coefficient is
0.1 and is included in contact body definition with BCBODY  option or the contact tables using the BCTABLE  option.  Another
significant point is the use of BIAS  in frictional problems. The bias factor measures the non-dimensionalized distance on
both sides of the contact surface which is used to make a decision if the node is in contact or not, based on whether the
node falls within this band defined by contact zone tolerance. Ideally, it should be 1.0 or as close to it. However, due to the
possibility of excessive iterations in case of even very slight penetration, the bias is kept as zero or, in other words, a slight
penetration is accepted. While a bias of zero works well for nonfrictional problems, it can be a detriment for frictional
problems which require the bias to be set as close to one as possible in order to avoid a fictitious tangential force on the
node which can cause non convergence of the solution. Finally, the ERROR parameter denotes the contact zone tolerance.
The default value is about 1/20th of the smallest element size for a solid element. In this case, it has been chosen to be an
even smaller value of 0.005.
T o identify how the contact bodies can touch each other, the BCTABLE  option is used. BCTABLE  with ID 0 is used to define
the touching conditions at the start of the analysis. This is a mandatory option required in SOL 400 for contact analysis
and it is flagged in the case control section through the optional BCONTACT = 0  option. The BCTABLE  with ID 1 is
used to define the touching conditions for later increments in the analysis, and it is flagged using BCONTACT = 1  in the
case control section. Also, the SECNDRY-PRIMARY c ombination defines that the nodes for body 1 are nodes belonging
to the secondary b ody. This, in literature, is referred by various terminologies as either contacting body nodes or tied nodes
(imagining the situation of multi-point constraints). The nodes belonging to body 2 are said to belong to the primary b ody&lt;/li&gt;

The Young’s modulus is taken to be 10 GPa with a Poisson’s ratio of 0.4.

The nonlinear procedure used is defined through the following NLPARM  entry:

FNT represents Full Newton-Raphson technique wherein the stiffness is reformed at every iteration; KSTEP  (field after FNT)
is left blank and in conjunction with FNT, it indicates that the program will determine if the stiffness needs to be reformed
between the end of the load step and the start of next load increment.
Fifty (50) is the maximum number of allowed recycles for every increment and, if this were to be exceeded, the load step
would be cut-back and the increment repeated. UV indicates that the maximum norm of vector component of the
incremental displacements will be checked for convergence. ALL indicates that intermediate output will be produced after
every increment. The second line of NLPARM  indicates that a tolerance of 0.01 will be used for displacement based
convergence checking.
NLAUTO  defines the parameters in the adaptive load stepping scheme. The initial load step is 1% of the total load. It must
be noted that, for many problems including plasticity of complicated contact conditions in the early stages of the analysis,
this must be a very small percentage (typically 0.5%). The smallest and largest ratio between the steps is 0.1 and 1.2,
respectively, while the minimum value of the step is . Finally, the desired number of recycles is kept at ten which is
the default in SOL 400. If this number is chosen to be very small, then the step size is cut to a smaller size for convergence
to be achieved and there will be larger number of steps. If this number is very large, then the load step will allow more
iterations for convergence in the same step.
The number of increments is provided in the third field of the NLPARM  option. It is also worth noting that removing the
NLAUTO  option results in a constant load step procedure with a total of 20 load increments per step (thus, a total of 40
for the analysis).
Alternately another nonlinear procedure used is defined through the following NLSTEP  entry like:
NLSTEP         1      1.                                                +&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adaptive time procedure with total time of 1 is used. Initial time step of 0.01 is used as fraction of total time. It means the
initial load step is 1% of the total load. It must be noted that, for many problems including plasticity of complicated contact
conditions in the early stages of the analysis, this must be a very small percentage (typically 0.5%). The maximum number
of recycles allowed for each increment are 10 and minimum is 1. The desired number of recycles per increment is 4. If this
number is chosen to be very small, then the step size is cut to a smaller size for convergence to be achieved and there will
be larger number of steps. If this number is very large, then the load step will allow more iterations for convergence in the
same step.The smallest and largest ratio between the steps is 0.1 and 1.2, respectively, while the minimum value of the step
is 1E-5. Output is written to result file for every single increment. 105–&lt;/p&gt;

Figure 23-2 shows the sequence of the analysis with a close-up view of the buckle. It can be seen that the clip slides on top
of the protrusion of the static frame without any penetration. It is quite remarkable that even with the large motion as well
as large sliding contact per load increment between the two deformable contact bodies, the analysis shows a robust behavior.
A vector plot of the comparison of normal and frictional contact forces with the Marc results is presented in Figure 23-3 and
Figure 23-4, respectively. The contact forces for SOL 400 and Marc agree very well in both magnitude and direction.

Next, the load displacement for the frictional and frictionless cases are compared in Figure 23-5. Only the X direction forces
are plotted versus time. It is always recommended to perform a frictionless analysis ( nug_27f.dat ) whenever possible to
aid in the understanding of the affect of adding friction. As expected, for the frictionless case, the load displacement curve
is symmetric about the center line (between the insertion and removal steps). Deformed geometry is shown at various peaks
of the curve and, as intuition would suggest, the peak forces correspond to the point of maximum bending. Addition of
the non-conservative friction forces destroys the symmetry and the peak insertion force increases compared to the peak
force in removal. The removal of the clip generates less pull-out force compared to the push-in force. Also, the insertion

force starts reducing due to frictional forces aiding the motion as opposed to resisting the motion as the sliding switches
from the convex part to the concave part of the contact surface.

Performing the calculation of the bending stress at the outer fibers of the thinnest section gives,
.
The value of  agrees closely to the corresponding bending stresses in Figure 23-6 of . As
expected, the linear solution presents an upper-bound to the actual stresses.
Modeling Tips
The two most important aspects in the analysis comprise of the inclusion of assumed strain enhancements to the standard
element formulation and the choice of contact and time stepping scheme parameters use of adaptive load stepping scheme,
and its associated parameters. The former is important due to presence of bending stresses in the structure which can
manifest themselves as (sometimes large) spurious shear stresses. This is a purely numerical artifact due to the standard,
displacement based finite element chosen which can be ameliorated by the use of an assumed strain enhancement to the
standard element.
Among the numerical parameters affecting the convergence of the job, the two most important parameters for this kind of
analysis are the contact bias and maximum number of recycles for the adaptive stepping scheme.
In contact analysis with friction, it is important to use a high bias (preferably 0.99) for frictional problems for improved
convergent results. In many cases (although, not in this problem, nug_27b.dat ), it can decrease the number of iterations
as well.
Next is the contact zone tolerance. Typically, a default value is 1/20th the smallest length of solid element. If the contact
zone is too big, then there could be a loss of accuracy due to acceptance of penetrated nodes or large amount of recycling
due to contact nodes separating. However, reducing the contact zone tolerance may not always yield the reduction in the
number of iterations. In fact, in certain problems where there are not many separations expected, reducing to a very small
number can even increase the number of iterations due to contact detection and scaling of incremental displacements in
the iterative penetration checking algorithm in contact.
It is also worth noting that the adaptive load stepping improves the speed and accuracy of the analysis quite significantly
for this problem due to its intelligent choice of time steps based on the convergence parameters. This adequately
demonstrates the strength of the adaptive stepping in tough problems where the smart algorithm adjusts the increment size
based on the kinematics of deformation, contact constraints, and convergence rates rather than the fixed time stepping
where the only alternative is to cut down the existing increment size in case of non convergence in the specified number of
recycles.
It is also noted that a very high or very low number of desired number of recycles can either invoke an excessive number of
iterations or induce cutbacks during the analysis. For example, decreasing the desired number of recycles to may increase
the number of increments. Due to a large amount of sliding and significant contact nonlinearity, a large number of recycles,
in general, are expected for most increments. Therefore, a high number of desired recycles proved to be useful in this
particular example. However, in problems with milder material and/or contact nonlinearities where only a few iterations 3

per increment are expected, a smaller number of desired recycles can yield faster results. This difference can result in notable
savings of the computing time for large jobs.
Flat rigid surfaces can be glued to the ends of the buckle and insert to control the insertion and extraction of the insert in
and out of the buckle. The advantage of this modeling technique is that the total insertion and extraction force component,
Fx, can be easily determined as shown in Figure 23-5, since all of the forces acting on rigid bodies are resolved to a single
force and moment vector acting at the position of the rigid bodies.
Finally, since the buckle has a plane of symmetry, it is cost effective to only model the half of the model say above this plane
of symmetry.

Introduction
The model airplane engine analysis consists of a cylinder head, a engine block, a gasket, bolts, and a plug. The gasket is
assembled between the head and the block. The problems demonstrates how the solution sequence 400 of MSC Nastran
can be used for a typical analysis for engine involving the nonlinear pressure -over closure relationship of the gasket material
and bolt pre-tension load. Glued contact is used to establish contact between the different parts of this engine model.
Solution Requirements
The nonlinear analysis involving large displacement and gasket nonlinearity is carried for the model airplane engine to find
the forces in the bolts and contact forces in the gasket. While the deformations are relatively small the Large Displacement
activates the initial stress capability which is required for proper modeling of the gasket and the bolts.
FEM Solutions
MSC Nastran’s nonlinear solution sequence SOL 400 is used to analyze the engine model under the bolt and pressure loads
in two steps. The details of finite element models, contact simulations, material, load, boundary conditions, and solution
procedure are discussed in the following sections.
Finite Element Model
The finite element model used for the 3-D solid approach is shown in Figure 24-1. The model consists of 88293 CTETRA&lt;br&gt;
element and 468 CHEXA  elements. MSC Nastran’s 4-node tetrahedral elements are used for block using the following PSOLID&lt;br&gt;
and PSLDN1  options. Head, bolts, and plug are also models with 4-node tetrahedral elements.

The following BCTABLE  entries identify how the contact bodies can touch each other. The BCTABLE  with ID 1 is used to
define contact conditions at the first step of the analysis. Since there is no difference in the contacts in Second Step the
same BCTABLE with ID 1 is used to define the contact conditions for second step in the analysis, and it is flagged using
the option BCONTACT (Case) = 2  in the case control section. Glued contact is used for all the six contact pairs defined in
the BCTABLE  option. Delayed sliding is enabled for the contact pairs involving gasket by choosing the value 2 for the field

Figure 24-3  Pressure-over Closure Relations for Gasket Materials
Loading and Boundary Conditions
The analysis for the model airplane engine is carried out in two steps. In the first step, a pre-tension load is applied on bolts.
In the second step, a pressure load is applied in the part of head and gasket. Some nodes on the outer boundaries on the
block are constrained in all directions. Figure 24-4 shows these boundary conditions applied in both Steps 1 and 2.0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.200102030405060Unloading Curve RingLoading Curve RingUnloading Curve BodyLoading Curve BodyRingBodyGasket Pressure (MPa)

Figure 24-4  Constraints used in Steps 1 and 2
The following data in case control section of the input file defines the load and boundary conditions at the two different
steps of the analysis. The bulk data entries SPCD, SPC1, and PLOAD4  are used to define the boundary condition and loads in
these steps. Bolt pretension loading is simulated using BOLT.
In order to define Pre-Stress in Bolts, Bolt modeling is carried out using BOLT  entry. BOL T&lt;br&gt;
consists of combination of two pairs, TOP and BOTTOM  nodes set. The key idea is to split the
element mesh of the bolt across the shaft in two disjoint parts, such that duplicate grid points
appear at the cut, and to create an overlap or gap between the two parts via multi-point
constraints. If the motion of these parts is somehow constrained in the direction in which the
gap or overlap is created, then an overlap (shortening) will introduce a tensile (pre-) stress in each
of the parts and a gap (elongation) will result in a compressive stress. This technique is more
elaborated in Chapter 20: Bolted Plates .
However the internal MPC equations are generated between the TOP and BOTTOM  nodes to a
free node which is also called as Control node. The BOLT entry for Bolt_1  is defined as follows:
BOLT       89847   38083
TOP        38271   38272   38273   38274   38275   38276   38277+&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction
This test case demonstrates contact analysis using MSC Nastran. T wo types of contact conditions between components are
considered:
glue contact
nonglue contact
In the first one, the contact is maintained for all the analysis after it occurs. In other words, nodes in contact are not allowed
to separate whereas, in the second one, separation can change depending on the loading conditions.
Large displacement/rotation and nonlinear materials are not taken into account in this example.
Solution Requirements
The numerical analysis is performed to demonstrate the behaviors of the 3-D surface contact solution into MSC Nastran.
In particular, the simultaneous presence of glue, nonglue surface contact is considered. The deformed structure, the
satisfaction of the relative motion between components, and the stresses in the contact regions are considered as result of
the analysis.
FEM Solutions
FEM solutions have been obtained with MSC Nastran’s solution sequence SOL400. The details of finite element models,
contact simulations, material, load, boundary conditions, and solution procedure are discussed.Boundary conditions Pinned Connections with/without Glued Contact SOL 400

Finite Element Models
The structure consists of different components that have been modeled independently taking into account that matching
meshes are not needed in the contact regions.
Due to geometrical behaviors:
The pins and the spacers have been modeled by 8-node CHEXA  elements
4-node CTETRA  elements have been used to model the remaining components. Note that fine meshes have been
used for these components in order to avoid the rigidity of such kind of element associated with this type of
element.
For the axle, two CBAR elements have been used. In this way the proper load has been applied in the middle grid point. No
LGDISP  parameter has been defined and therefore no geometrical nonlinearity is considered.
Contact Models
In defining the contact regions for the structure, the components are modeled as deformable bodies. In particular, 15
contact bodies have been defined by specific BCBODY  and BSURF  entries (each couple of options has been defined using the
same identifier). Note that each of them has been defined considering all the elements belonging to the specific
components.

Each contact body has been defined in the same way so, as an example, one set of options is used to define one of them
that has been listed:

In the above BCBODY  option, the 3-D (third field) elements mentioned in the BSURF  which identifier is 13 (look at the
fifth field) define the contact body number 13. Furthermore:
The fourth field defines the general behavior of the contact body. In this case, it is a deformable contact body
The null value in the sixth field means that symmetric penetration or double side contact check is considered. The
contact is verified symmetrically and both the contact surfaces are checked for penetration and, also, if we need to
define a PRIMARY  and a SECNDRY  in any case.
The empty seventh field forces a null friction coefficient. It means that no tangential forces are generated when the
contact condition occurs, unless these bodies are glued together.
The negative value in the eighth field allows activating the analytic option for a deformable body. It is used in this
case because the part of each component involved in the contact process is cylindrical and therefore is simple to
represent it analytically. In this way, the contact is represented in the best way.
After the definition of the contact bodies, each couple of bodies that could be in contact must be defined in the BCTABLE&lt;br&gt;
option. In this entry, one of the contact bodies is defined as the PRIMARY  while the other one is the SECNDRY . The contact
behaviors are completely defined. An example of the option format used in this case is listed below:

It can be checked how the nineteen contact regions (look at the fifth field of the above BCTABLE  option) are defined in
the same. The only difference is in the eighth field of the option where the SECNDRY  option is defined. In fact, we can see
a unit or null value. If a unit value is defined, the two contact surfaces must be glued. It means that the glue option is
activated and all the degrees of freedom of the nodes are tied in case of deformable-deformable contact once the node comes
in contact. In general, if the unit value is defined, all degrees of freedom are MPCd in the deformable-deformable contact
once the grids have come in contact. T o turn on the general SOL 400 contact algorithm the BCPARA  entry:
BCPARA, 0, NLGLUE,1
is used. It should be taken into account that if, in SOL 400 on the BCTABLE , there are multiple GLUE and non GLUE&lt;br&gt;
entries associated with different SECNDRY  entries, then, the above option must be used. It is the case in this example.
A null value activates the standard contact conditions. It means that a SECNDRY  node can move only over the PRIMARY&lt;br&gt;
contact surface when it comes in contact (except if glued). In this case, if the general load condition leads to the separation
of the contact bodies, the secondary n ode start again to move without constraints. Note that in this entry different contact
parameters (the distance below which the node is considered in contact, friction coefficient, separation force, stress friction
limit, contact tolerance bias, etc…) can be defined for each contact region.
The BCTABLE  entry is activated by BCONTACT (Case)  option in the Case Control section.  Note that in this case, a BCONTACT =
0, defined above the subcase level activates the corresponding BCPARA,0  and BCTABLE,0 entries defined in the Bulk
Data Section. It allows to initially identify contacting bodies. Note that in SOL 400, a BCONTACT =0 is allowed above
all subcases but is not required. Any of the contact Bulk Data entries that allow a 0 and have a 0 value ID field are
automatically sensed by SOL 400 with or without a BCONTACT = 0  command. The contact regions are summarized in
the table below.

The torsion link apex pivot is rigidly connected to the LOWER  torque link while a nonglued contact region is
defined between the first body contact and the UPPER  torque link. Also, the APEX SPACER  is in the same contact
condition. Considering the null friction coefficient, this modeling solution allows to avoid any singularity
maintaining the relative rotational motion between the two links.
The rigid link pivot is rigidly connected to the LOWER  torque link but it is connected by nonglued contact region

Solution Procedure
In the present analysis, contact is the only nonlinearity. It means that the provided load condition generates small
displacements and only the stresses are in the linear elastic part of the stress-strain curve of the material. As consequence,
no geometrical and material nonlinearity are taken in account. Furthermore, looking at the geometries, the contact
conditions seems to be not so complicated, It simplifies the approach to be used in the analysis.
First of all no STEP (Case)  is defined under the SUBCASE (Case)  level.

PV indicates that convergence will be checked on vector component (V) of the residuals ( P). In this V method,
convergence checking is performed on the maximum vector component of all components in the model.
YES indicates that intermediate output is produced after every increment.
Results
No results to compare are available for this test case so what has been obtained by the calculation will be checked from a
qualitative viewpoint. The maximum total displacement occurs in the bottom part of the inner cylinder, close to the axle
(where the concentrated loads are applied).

To check how the contact is working it is possible to take advantage of a procedure that in MSC Nastran allows storing all
the contact results into the database. In fact it is not possible to obtain these data into XDB (PARAM, POST,0) or OUTPUT2
(PARAM,POST,-1 ) postprocessing files while adding the keyword:
scr = post
in the Nastran command line, all the results, including the contact ones, are stored into the database. They are retrieved
into MSC Patran selecting:

It is possible to understand which components are in contact displaying the Contact Status  output. As first example some
of the contact regions belonging to the lower and upper torque links will be considered.
Looking at the Contact Status  Contours in Figure 25-7 and taking into account the contact regions behaviors (as
summarized in Figure 25-6) we can say that:
Both the contact bodies regions ( PRIMARY  and SECNDRY ) are highlighted.
The contact status in the UPPER TORQUE LINK-TORSION LINK APEX PIVOT  nonglued contact region put in
evidence how the deformation of the structure determines the contact only in a limited part of the bodies.
A good contact modeling is recognized by a congruent representation of the Contact Status  output in the
PRIMARY  and SECNDRY  contact bodies. In particular in case of glued contact a continuous contact status contour
should be displayed. A different representation could highlights problems in the geometries of the contact bodies.

A nonclear situation is displayed for the nonglued contact between UPPER TORQUE LINK  and TORSION APEX PIVOT .
In fact, the contact status is differently represented in the corresponding contact regions of the two components. Probably,
the combined effects of the deformation and the different element types in the two components determine it.
Differently, in case of nonglued contact regions defined in the UPPER CYLINDER-UPPER LINK PIVOT  connection the
contact status seems to be represented correctly (see Figure 25-8). In fact, there is a complete congruency between the two
regions that are in contact.

Modeling Tips
Important behaviors of this example are the definition of glued and nonglued contact regions and the effects of contact
geometries to obtain good results. Contact is only verified in a qualitative viewpoint by the analysis of the Contact Status&lt;br&gt;
output.
The following are some guidelines and tips for modeling this benchmark:
The geometry of a contact surface should be defined property in order to avoid problems when it touches another
surface contact.&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction
Brake squeal is the unpleasant high frequency vibrations (2000 to 10000 Hz) that occur in disk brake systems. Application
of the brakes causes an increase in line pressure which results in the caliper piston (s) to push the pads against the spinning
rotor. A valuable review paper by Kinkaid et al. (Kinkaid  2003) provide a comprehensive review and bibliography of
research on disc brake squeal. The high pitch noise or squeal occurs when a specific combination of piston pressure, friction
and damping effects cause two stable modes to merge or coalesce into a single unstable mode.
The solution to preventing modal coalescence is to modify the design. This would include, but is not limited to, material
changes, design changes and the addition or modification of present damping components. However the analysis of disk
brake systems has been challenging due to the complexity of the structure, material properties and loading environment.
Brake squeal analysis models require not only the typical FEM mesh of the components (pads and rotor at a minimum),
but also the representation of the contact/frictional connection between the pad and rotor. This contact/friction is
represented by an unsymmetric stiffness matrix. Previously in Nastran there were restrictions imposed by this method that
included:
The meshed contact area between the rotor and pad must be congruent
Separation is not allowed; full contact is maintained
The contact matrix is supplied as a DMIG  generated outside of the normal FEM calculations
Each contact condition involving the friction coefficient and loading (magnitude and pattern) required a unique
DMIGApplied loads Piston pressure normal to pad surface
Element types 8-node solid element HEXA and PENTA. Both conventional element and advanced
nonlinear element may be used.

T ypically, the generation of the DMIG entries required days to weeks of analysis time. Interested users are directed to Section
5.3 of the Advanced Dynamic Analysis Users Guide for a description on manual generation of the contact/friction
connection DMIG  entries.
The advanced nonlinear element may now be used as conventional elements in Brake Squeal Analysis and other linear
perturbation analysis. However, it should be noted that the advanced nonlinear elements will be creating, using, and storing
much more data than the conventional elements. It will require more memory and space. Storage of the advanced nonlinear
element datablocks may be selected and controlled by Case Control Card DBSAVE .
The introduction of the brake squeal analysis capability in this release has eliminated all of the previous restrictions. In
addition, the user now has the capability to examine various combinations of friction values, loading, and contact
definitions in a single execution. Further, the system matrices can include, at user request, differential stiffness due to
preloading, large displacement effects and full nonlinear property definitions. No longer is the brake squeal analysis limited
to a string of single shot runs or multiple restarts. This example features the following: 3-D deformable-deformable contact
with friction, multiple SUBCASE (Case) /STEP (Case)  analysis, user selectable complex solution domain - real or modal space,
choice of complex Lanczos or Hessenberg solver, and full user control of contact parameters.
Solution Requirements
Brake squeal analysis is activated in MSC Nastran&amp;rsquo;s Advanced Nonlinear solution sequence ( SOL 400) with the Bulk Data
entry BSQUEAL . The BSQUEAL  entry is selectable within the Case Control section at the SUBCASE  level. With the
ANALYSIS (Case)  chaining capability complex eigenvalues can be computed at user selected load factors.The case control
loading and modal extraction requests are shown in the listing that follows. This example demonstrates the extraction of
complex modes at specific piston load points

The analysis contains a single SUBCASE (Case)  with four STEP (Case) s. Step 1 performs the nonlinear loading in 10 steps.
Contact bodies are selected with the BCONTACT (Case)  where the contact friction values are defined on the Bulk Data BCTABLE .
This step performs a normal nonlinear 3-D contact analysis that allows separation of the contact surfaces.
Steps 2 through 4 perform a complex eigenvalue extraction at selected load points. The methods used to extract the modes
are defined above all the STEP definitions. Activation is done with the ANALYSIS (Case)=MCEIG  entry which requires a
normal modes and complex modes selection which in this example is above all STEP  definitions. The user has access to all
of the MSC Nastran modern modal methods: Lanczos, complex Lanczos, and Hessenberg.
Load steps selected for complex mode extraction is defined by the NLIC  entry. This entry selects the loading STEP  and
the load increment - LOADFAC . The allowable values for LOADFAC  are determined by the INC value defined on the Bulk
Data NLPARM  entry. The BSQUEAL  entry is also present to select the variables such as friction value to be used in generating
the contact stiffness matrix between the pad and rotor. As the example shows, complex modes are extracted for a defined
friction value of 0.3 at piston loads of 20, 50, and 80 percent of the maximum. This then allows, in one execution,
monitoring the complex modes for possible coalesce of two modes which signals the onset of brake squeal.
If using Advanced Nonlinear Elements in the model, its corresponding datablocks should be saved in NLSTATIC  analysis
for use in the following perturbation analysis. The first STEP should include Case Control DBSAVE  as

Contact is easily defined in MSC Nastran. The Bulk Data pair BCBODY /BSURF  to designate the type of contact body
(deformable) and the elements comprising the contact body. The contact algorithms locate the element faces that will
potentially participate in contact surfaces. There is no need for user effort to limit the elements listed on the BSURF  entry
to aid the contact algorithms. For example, all of the elements in the rotor are selected in BCBODY /BSURF 4  of the larger
model, and there is no need to painstaking pick only those elements that might contact the pads; similarly for the pads.
The contact bodies for this example model are shown in Figure 26-1. Note that the elements defining the contact body can
be groups of discontinuous elements as shown by the brake pads.
Figure 26-1  Contact Bodies
Additional contact bodies are permitted. With disk brake systems, other components would be (but not limited to) the
caliper, pistons, guide pins, and steering knuckle. The BCTABLE  collects the contact bodies and assigns various parameters
related to the surface contact. In the example below, there are four contact bodies. Contact between the pads and pistons
are defined as glued contact - integer 1 in field 8. Glued contact also has the feature of eliminating the requirement of
matching mesh gridpoints between the bodies. Pad and rotor contact is defined as full nonlinear contact with a frictional
value of 0.3.
If the contact surfaces are a mixture on glued (pistons to pads) and full nonlinear contact (pads to rotor) the BCPARA  entry
is also required.
BCPARA   0       nlglue  1
This ensures that a contact body that participate in glued and full nonlinear contact will maintain the full nonlinear contact
status in all STEP (Case) s.

BCTABLE  with ID 0 is used to define the touching conditions at the start of the analysis. This is a mandatory option
required in SOL 400 for contact analysis, and it is flagged in the case control section through the optional BCONTACT (Case)&lt;br&gt;
= 0 option. The BCTABLE  with ID 1 is used to define the touching conditions for later increments in the analysis, and it
is flagged using BCONTACT = 1  in the case control section. Also, the SECNDRY-PRIMARY  combination defines that the
nodes for body 1 are nodes belonging to the secondary b ody. This in literature is referred by various terminologies as either
contacting body nodes or tied nodes (imagining the situation of multi-point constraints). The nodes belonging to body 2
are said to belong to the primary b ody which are also referred to as the contacted body nodes or the retained nodes
(imagining the situation of multi-point constraints)
The definition of the contact bodies (defined as Rotor and Pads in Figure 26-1 above) as stated above use the
BCBODY /BSURF  Bulk Data pair. The BCBODY  options define the deformable body including the body ID,
dimensionality, type of body, type of contact constraints and friction, etc. BSURF  identifies the elements forming a part of
the deformable body and includes the convenient THRU  option when listing the element ID&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;

Brake Squeal Parameters

AVSTIF  is the average stiffness on a per unit basis between the pad and disk. This variable is under user control instead of
a hidden predefined value. This stiffness is used in forming the penalty contact stiffness between the pad and rotor. Thus
AVSTIF  has a direct influence over the overall stability of the model and the values of the brake squeal modes. The default
value is 1.0E+4 however it is advised that until the user is comfortable with the calculated results, several additional brake
squeal runs be performed using alternate AVSTIF  values.
Evaluation of the proper value for AVSTIF  (or if the default is appropriate) can be easily accomplished with the STEP&lt;br&gt;
command. As the BSQUEAL  is called from the Case Control section, a series of STEP s can be defined each calling a
BSQUEAL  Bulk Data entry with a unique AVSTIF .
The second line of data defines the rotational axis of the rotor; all reference from the basic rectangular coordinate system.
The first three values define the cosines of the rotation axis. The second three values represent a point on the rotation axis.
As the rotor spins about the Z direction, only the Z cosine is supplied. Any point coordinate on the Z axis would be
acceptable for the three values as the rotor straddles the Z=0.0  plane.

The displacements for the pads simulate the guidance of the brake caliper system. This is best described in Figure 26-2.

Solution Procedure
The nonlinear procedure used is defined through the following NLPARM  entry:
NLPARM   2                       FNT                     PV      YES
FNT represents Full Newton Raphson technique wherein the stiffness is reformed at every iteration. KSTEP  (field after FNT)
is left blank, and in conjunction with FNT, it indicates that stiffness needs to be reformed between the end of the load step
and the start of next load increment. The maximum number of allowed recycles for every increment is left at the default
of 25. If more than 25 recycles is exceeded, the load step would be cut-back and the increment repeated. PV indicates that
the maximum norm of vector component of the incremental loads will be checked for convergence. YES indicates that
intermediate output will be produced after every increment. The second line of NLPARM  is not defined indicating that
default tolerances will be used for convergence checking.
The number of increments is provided in the 3rd field of the NLPARM  option. The default is 10 and this ties back to the
allowable values for LOADFAC  on the NLIC (Case)  entry.

Introduction
This problem demonstrates the ability of the Nastran SOL 400 thermal nonlinear solution sequence to perform thermal
radiation view factor calculations using the Hemi-cube and Gaussian integration methods. The Gaussian adaptive
integration view factor calculation method has been with Nastran for many years. The view factor computed by the
Gaussian method is extremely accurate. However, as the problems get big, computation time is roughly proportional to the
number of surfaces squared. The introduction of Hemi-cube method in MSC Nastran permits the solution of very large
scale view factor problems where previously the use of the Gaussian method was overly time intensive. As compared to the
adaptive Gaussian method, we have seen an improvement in CPU speed of 33 times in some problems. The CPU time
increases linearly with the number of radiation surfaces because in Hemi-cube, the computation time is linearly
proportional to the number of surfaces. In this problem, we have an analytical solution in which we compare both Hemi-
cube and the Adaptive Gaussian integration methods to see which method offers the most accuracy.

Figure 27-1  Concentric Spheres (top sector of outer sphere removed)
As shown in ( Figure 27-1), the inner sphere with radius equal to 1 inch is subjected to a constant temperature of 1000°K
(red). There is radiation exchange between the inner and the outer sphere (orange). The outer sphere radiates to space at
an ambient temperature of zero K with view factors equal to 1.0.&lt;/p&gt;

For these two diffuse isothermal concentric spheres, the view factors need to be determined. Since all of the energy leaving
the inner sphere (1) will arrive at the outer sphere (2), . The reciprocity relation for view factors gives
, or . Since the inner sphere cannot see itself, . Finally since
energy must be conserved, the sum of all view factors of a closed cavity must be unity, which yields,
. Notice how the number of view factors grow as the square of the number of surfaces, i.e. two
surfaces yield 4 view factors. Given the geometry of the spheres as  and , the four view factors become:
. Below is an equation for calculation of outer sphere temperature where the outer sphere is
radiating to space at absolute zero and a view factor of 1. (Holman, Jack P . Holman Heat T ransfer . McGraw-Hill, 2001).
This solution assumes perfect conduction  (no resistance to heat flow) in the outer sphere.
While, in general, the view factors cannot be obtained from analytical solutions, in this simple problem, the view factors
can be found analytically and we can use these view factors in a simple three grid model to check our analytic solution
above. One grid represents the inner sphere, another represents the outer sphere, and the last grid represents the ambient
temperature of the outer sphere.

In this case, we have CHBDYG element 6987 with TYPE=&amp;lsquo;AREA4 &amp;rsquo; bounded by grid 3390, 3389, 3397, 3398. The normal
vector is defined by the grid connectivity and is directed from the inner sphere to the outer sphere ( Figure 27-2 and
Figure 27-3). The internal sphere has KSHD  defined on the 4th field of the VIEW data entry, which means that this group of
elements can shade the view of other elements. The external sphere has KBSHD  defined which means that these elements&lt;/p&gt;

can also be shaded by other elements. The reason that we have specified the shading flag is to speed up the sorting for these
potential blockers in the view factor calculations. In general when the surface is very complex, the use of the flag called
BOTH  is recommended. The RADSET  option tells us there is only 1 cavity in the model, and the 2nd field on the VIEW  points
to the IVIEWF  or IVIEWB  on the CHBDYG  field 5th or 6th, respectively. For a plate element, there is top and the bottom
surface for view factor calculations. For a solid element, only the front side IVIEWF  should be used. The inner sphere here
is represented by number as 1 on the field 5 ( IVIEWF ) on the CHBDYG. The 7th and 8th represent the ID for the RADM&lt;br&gt;
option where 7th field is the top surface RADM  ID and the 8th field is the bottom surface RADM  ID. The RADM  specified
the emissivity used for the sphere and, in this case, the emissivity for the inner sphere is equal to 0.7.
The RADCAV  bulk data entry indicates that we will print the summary of view factor calculations. In this case, we have a
complete enclosure and, therefore, the view factor summation should equal 1.0. The surface numbers 703, 704 are the ID
numbers for the CHBDYG that has the radiation exchange.

Radiation - RADBC (radiation to space)
On the outer sphere, we have a radiation to space using the view factor supplied on the 3rd field on the RADBC . (see Example&lt;br&gt;

Please note the negative EID represents that the radiation to space is effected from the back surface (opposite to the

The nonlinear procedure used is defined using the following NLPARM  entry:
NLSTEP         1      1.                                                +&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In thermal analysis, the TEMPD  bulk data entry specifies the initial temperature for the nonlinear radiation analysis. In this
case, an initial guessed temperature of 800° was used. A casual selection of initial guessed temperature is not so important
in a nonlinear conduction and convection thermal analysis. However, for nonlinear radiation analysis where the thermal
radiation transfer is given by , an initial guess is very helpful. The error (residual) is proportional
to the temperature to the 4th power. It is. therefore, recommended to specify a higher estimated temperature in a radiation
dominant problem.
The default method for the NLPARM  is the AUTO method in SOL 400 analyses. The convergence criterion is based on
UPW. In this problem, you can achieve convergence by either the PFNT  method (as above) or the AUTO method:
NLSTEP         1      1.                                                +&lt;/p&gt;

Main Index
The U convergence criterion measures the error tolerance for the temperature. It has a recommended value of 1.0e-3 or
smaller for thermal problem. The P and W convergence criteria measure the error tolerances for the load and work,
respectively.
The number of increments is specified on the 3rd field of the NLPARM  data entry ( NINC ). This should be set to 1 for
steady-state thermal analyses since convergence can be achieved in one step only. This, typically, is not the case for structural
analyses, where NINC  is set to 10 by default. Generally, the PFNT or FNT methods are used for highly nonlinear
mechanical analyses.
Modeling Tips
The current model uses 1268 surfaces to define the radiating surfaces of both spheres. The CPU run times for the Gaussian
and Hemi-cube methods are nearly the same, at 27 seconds.
Figure 27-4, however, shows the dramatic increase in run time for the Gaussian model and the clear benefits of the Hemi-
cube method as the number of surfaces increases.
At 20,000 surfaces, the Gaussian model takes 33 time longer to complete.

Introduction
This example demonstrates the chaining of thermal and structural analysis in SOL 400 whereby the first step is a nonlinear
steady state thermal analysis subject to heat flux on the chip, convection and radiation boundary conditions, and the second
step is a nonlinear static analysis using the temperatures from the first step. The thermal stress analysis chaining has always
been available in the linear heat transfer to linear static analysis using param, heatstat,yes in the SOL 101 run. However, it
was not possible previously in Nastran to run a nonlinear heat transfer followed by the static analysis in a single execution
because SOL 101 is a linear heat transfer solution. The only alternative is to run a nonlinear thermal analysis using SOL
153 and used the resulting temperature punch file as the input thermal load for your stress analysis. The user can output a
punch file by specifying TEMPERATURE (Case)(PRINT,PUNCH)=all  in the first run. This will create a punch file that
consists of temperature for every grids in the model. In the thermal stress run he can use the TEMP(LOAD)=1  in the case
control to use the temperature load in the static run. Chaining of thermal and structural analyses facilitates design studies
based on:
1.changing the materials properties
2.changing the thermal boundary conditions
3.changing structure constraints
whereby the temperatures as well as the corresponding displacements are visualized in a single run.
Solution Requirements
Bonded joints are used in the design of a circuit board. A change in temperature due to the equipment operation can
introduce stresses in joined materials of dissimilar thermal expansion coefficient. In this case we have chip heating due to
the applied power, causing thermal gradients in the different materials which, together with the  fixed displacements cause
high stresses near the end of the lead frame.
The chip dimension ( Figure 28-1) is 3.80 mm by 3.80mm with thickness equal to 0.7 mm. It is mounted on top of adhesive
(paste). The outer case dimension is 14 mm by 14 mm by 3.22 mm.

Figure 28-2  Outer Case
A heat flux is applied to the top surface of the chip with heat flux equal to 0.025 W/(mm2oC). The top surface, bottom
surface and the sides (adjacent to the lead frame where it is fixed) of the case are subjected to convection heat loss. Heat is
convected to the environment at 70oC. The respective heat transfer coefficient for the top, bottom and sides are 4.05x10-
5 W/(mm2oC), 2.026x10-5 W/(mm2oC) and 7.00x10-5 W/(mm2oC). Finally there is a radiation loss on top of the outer
case to ambient environment of 40oC with emissivity equal to 0.8 and view factor is 1.0.
The structural boundary conditions include fixing the end of the lead frame as shown in Figure 28-3.

FEM Modeling
Main Index
In running a thermal stress analysis, it is important to check you have specified a thermal coefficient of expansion on the
field 7 on the MATBV  bulk data entry. Otherwise, there will be no thermal expansion in your problem.
It is important that you have a consistent set of units. In this case, the thermal conductivity has units of W/(mm2 K), and
therefore your Young&amp;rsquo;s modulus should be in the unit of N/(mm2). This consistency also applies to the Stefan-Boltzmann
constant also used in the radiation boundary conditions with units of W/(mm2 K).

There are two steps in this analysis. The first step is associated with the thermal boundary conditions as indicated with
ANALYSIS (Case)=HSTAT . The second step is the thermal stress analysis and the structure boundary condition which the
ANALYSIS (Case)=NLSTAT . The TEMPERATURE (Case)(load)=1  in the second step will allow the Step 2 to pick up the
calculated temperature from step 1 as the thermal load for the calculation of thermal stress. Please note that the
param,lgdisp,1 is required when chaining thermal and structural analyses. The TEMP(INITIAL)=9  points to the
TEMPD ,9,0.0  in the bulk data section. This indicates the initial stress free temperature is at zero degrees. The thermal strain
is then equal to the product of the linear coefficient of thermal expansion times the change in temperature. In this example,
the thermal coefficient of expansion is constant, temperature dependency is also readily possible.
Following is the output from the thermal analysis and thermal stress analysis.

Introduction
This example demonstrates the beam-to-beam contact capabilities of MSC Nastran SOL 400. In contrast to the standard
grid-to-segment based contact, beam-to-beam contact is a true segment-to-segment contact, in which the beam elements
are able to touch each other at arbitrary locations mid-way between the grid points of the elements and can slide along each
other, with or without friction. The model consists of a woven fabric which is impacted by a rigid sphere. The fabric is a
plane weave and consists of  sinusoidally shaped yarns. It is clamped along the four sides and the yarns are initially
in contact at their intersections (see Figure 29-1). The total area of the fabric is . The sphere, with a radius of
and a mass density of , hits the fabric with an initial velocity of  at the center.

Solution Requirements
A numerical solution has been obtained with MSC Nastran’s SOL 400. The details of the finite element model, contact
simulation, material, load, boundary conditions, and solution procedure are discussed below.
The case control section of the input contains the following options for a nonlinear analysis:
BCONTACT = 0
SUBCASE 1
STEP 1
ANALYSIS=NLTRAN
TSTEPNL = 1
BCONTACT = 1
SPC = 1
IC = 2
The ANALYSIS (Case)  is a nonlinear transient analysis and contains a single subcase with one step. The step has time stepping
procedure and convergence control settings defined via TSTEPNL (Case) , contact table and parameters via BCONTACT (Case) ,
fixed displacements (or single point constraints) via SPC (Case) , initial velocity via IC (Case) , and the displacements results for
the.f06 (output) file.

The large strain option is activated for the nonlinear property extensions PBEMN1  to the beam elements, via the option:
NLMOPTS LRGSTRN 1
This option selects (among other things) the updated Lagrange formulation of these elements, which is needed for a proper
treatment of the large rotations of the beams.
Element Modeling
The yarns are modelled by 1440 2-node CBEAM  elements with an elliptical cross section. The orientation vector  that is
used to construct the local element y- and z-directions of the beams points in the basic Y -direction for the yarns in the basic
X-direction and it points in the basic X-direction for the yarns in the basic Y-direction. The element y-directions of the
beams are thus parallel to the basic XY-plane. The major axis of the elliptical cross section coincides with the element y-
direction and is also parallel to the basic XY-plane. The minor axis coincides with the element z-direction (see Figure 29-1
and Figure 29-2).

The nonlinear extensions to the beam elements can be activated using the PBEMN1  property extension to the regular PBEAM&lt;br&gt;
or PBEAML  options in the manner shown below:
PBEMN1  1
LS
This PBEMN1  option selects a thin elastic beam element with transverse shear effects, which is similar to the standard
CBEAM  element with only a PBEAM  property, except that the former allows nonlinear material behavior, such as
plasticity effects, to be used for the beam elements. In this example, no nonlinear material effects are considered, but the
beam elements with and without the property extension will be compared in the elastic regime.
Modeling Contact
The standard contact algorithm of MSC Nastran is based on a grid-to-segment approach. The grid points on the surface
of the touching (or secondary)  contact body can touch the segments on the surface of the touched (or primary)  contact
body. Here, the segments of a contact body are, for example, the faces of solid elements, the top and bottom surfaces of
shell elements, and the surface of a rigid contact body. The grid-to-segment algorithm works well for contact between solid,
shell and rigid contact bodies. It even works fine if the secondary b ody consists of beam elements and the primary i s a solid,
shell or rigid contact body. In that case, the grid points of the beams can touch the segments on the surface of the solid,
shell or rigid body.
If both secondary a nd primary b ody consist of beam elements, then the grid-to-segment approach is not very convenient.
Beams generally touch each other somewhere in the middle of the element and not necessarily at the grid points. The beam-
to-beam contact algorithm of MSC Nastran SOL 400 addresses this case. It is a true segment-to-segment contact
algorithm, in which the beam elements of the secondary c ontact body can touch the beam elements of the primary c ontact
body at arbitrary points mid-way between the grids of the elements. Moreover, beam elements which are in contact can
slide along each other with or without friction. The beam-to-beam contact algorithm is activated by the BEAMB  option
to BCPARA . It supplements the standard grid-to-segment algorithm, that is, the grid points of a beam contact body can touch
the surface of solid, shell or rigid bodies through the grid-to-segment algorithm and, if beam-to-beam contact is activated,
then the beam elements can also touch beam elements of another (or the same) contact body.
The cross section of the beam elements is taken into account when two beam elements are coming in contact, but the actual
shape of cross-section, defined by PBEAM  or PBEAML , for example, is ignored. Instead, a circular cross-section is assumed
for contact. The radius of the contact cross-section is called the “beam contact radius” and must be defined via the BCBMRAD&lt;br&gt;
option. The beam contact radius is defined on a per element basis and may vary from element to element. However, if a
beam element is initially in contact with another beam element and during the analysis slides off that element to a third
beam element with a different contact radius, the sudden jump in the contact radius may lead to convergence problems.
Therefore, the contact surface of the beam elements of a contact body is smoothed by averaging the beam contact radii of
the elements at the common grid points. The resulting contact surface for a sequence of beam elements is a piecewise
conically shaped surface (see Figure 29-3). Note that the beam contact radius is not used when the grid points of the beam
element touch a solid, shell or rigid contact body.J I1I2+2 =&lt;/p&gt;

Figure 29-3  Conically Shaped (Smoothed) Contact Surface Obtained by Averaging the Beam Contact Radii at the Grids
The present example contains three contact bodies. The first two bodies consist of the beam elements representing the yarns
in the basic X-direction and the beam elements representing the yarns in the basic Y-direction, respectively (see Figure 29-1).
The third contact body is the rigid sphere. The beam-to-beam contact algorithm is used to model contact between the
yarns. The standard grid-to-segment based contact algorithm handles contact between the grid points of the yarns and the
rigid sphere. Friction is included in the analysis, in the form of the force based, bilinear Coulomb friction model (type 6).
The BCPARA  bulk data option defines the number of bodies in contact and contact parameters like the friction type FTYPE&lt;br&gt;
and the beam-to-beam contact flag BEAMB .

The deformable contact bodies are defined by the bulk data entries BCBODY  and BSURF . The BCBODY  option defines the
contact body with its ID, dimension, type of body etc. and BSURF  identifies the elements forming the deformable body.

Note that the dimension of the two deformable contact bodies is set to 3D even though the bodies consist of 1D beam
elements. This is because the contact body lives in 3D-space, that is, all grid points have 3 displacement degrees of freedom.
The rigid sphere is defined as a load-controlled rigid contact body using a BCBODY  bulk data option. The BCBODY&lt;br&gt;
includes the NURBS surface definition of the sphere. The CONTROL  field is set to the ID (1) of the control grid point
associated with the body.

In contrast to a position or velocity controlled rigid body, the load-controlled body does not have a prescribed motion.
Instead, the displacement degrees of freedom of the control grid point are the displacements of the rigid body and can be
controlled by single point constraints or loads on the control grid point in the usual way. In this example, the rigid body
will be free to move in the basic Z-direction, while the motion in the other two directions will be suppressed via single point
constraints (see below).
The sphere is initially located in the positive Z-half space of the basic coordinate system, at some distance from the fabric.
During the initial contact search, the body will be moved towards the fabric, such that it just touches the fabric at start of
the first time step. This initial contact body approach is activated by the BCONTACT (Case)  = 0 case control option. During
the approach, the rigid body is moved in the direction of the velocity defined by the APPROV section of the BCBODY.

To identify how the contact bodies can touch each other, the BCTABLE  option is used. BCTABLE  with ID 0 is used to define
the touching conditions at the start of the analysis, during the initial contact search and the contact body approach. The
BCTABLE  with ID 1 is the main BCTABLE  used to define the touching conditions for later time steps in the analysis,
and it is flagged using BCONTACT (Case)  = 1 in the case control section. The two BCTABLEs  are identical and specify that
the yarns parallel to the basic X-direction (contact body 1) can touch the yarns parallel to the basic Y-direction (contact
body 2) and that the grid points of both beam contact bodies can touch the rigid sphere (contact body 3). The BCTABLE s
also define the friction coefficient (0.1) for all possible contact combinations.

The definition of the beam contact radii for the beam elements completes the contact set-up. The radii are defined via the
BCBMRAD  option. This is a mandatory option if beam-to-beam contact is used. Since the beams generally will touch each
other in the direction of the minor axis of the elliptical cross-section of the beam elements (see Figure 29-1), the beam contact
radius is set equal to the semi-minor axis  for all beam elements in the model.

The rigid sphere is allowed to move only in the basic Z-direction and is given an initial velocity in that direction towards
the fabric. As explained in the preceding section, the motion of the sphere is controlled by the displacements of the control

In a dynamic contact analysis in MSC Nastran SOL 400, the Generalized-Alpha operator with zero spectral radius is
automatically chosen by the program. The Generalized-Alpha operator uses two parameters NDAMP, NDAMPM   in its
formulation. By varying the values of these parameters, the spectral radius can be varied from 0.0 to 1.0. For contact
problems, NDAMP  is automatically taken as 0.0 and NDAMPM  as 1.0, yielding a spectral radius of zero. This is well-
suited to damp out high frequencies that are normally excited during the impact process. Other features that are
automatically used by the dynamic contact algorithm to avoid high frequency content include the following: There is no
projection of the contacting segment onto the contacted segment. A contacting segment that falls within the distance
tolerance is simply constrained in its current position. Also, if there is penetration detected during the Newton-Raphson
iterations, the maximum penetration is used as a scale-back factor to reduce the time step and restart the increment with
the reduced time step.
The TSTEPNL  entry controls the time stepping for the solution. Important parameters of the TSTEPNL  entry are as follows:
ID (2nd field of entry 1) - The ID is used as a cross-reference in the case control section to identify the TSTEPNL&lt;br&gt;
entry to be used for a particular step.
NDT, DT, NO (3rd - 5th fields of entry 1) - These parameters control the total simulation time, the initial analysis
time step, the output frequency and the maximum possible time step. The product of NDT and DT defines the total
simulation time - in the current problem, the total simulation time comes out to be 2x10-4 s. NO is left as blank in
the current problem - the default value of NO is 1 - this implies that for this problem, output is desired at every
single step. In addition, the maximum time step cannot exceed NO times DT - which means that for this problem,
the maximum time step cannot exceed 5e-7s. In general, for impact problems, given that the energy conversion
(from kinetic energy to strain energy and vice-versa) occurs during very small time intervals, it is important to keep
tight control over the time-steps.
METHOD , KSTEP  (6th and 7th fields of entry 1) - In the present problem, METHOD  is taken as PFNT . FNT or PFNT&lt;br&gt;
is a recommended default for contact problems. PFNT  denotes Pure Full Newton Technique wherein the operator
matrix is reformed at every iteration. KSTEP  is left as blank in the present problem, which for the PBEAM  +
PBEMN1  elements case will default to -1 and for the PBEAM  case will default to 1. KSTEP = 1  indicates that
the stiffness at the start of the next increment is taken to be the same as the stiffness at the last iteration of the
previous increment while KSTEP = -1  indicates that the stiffness is again updated at the start of the next
increment.
CONV  (9th field of entry 1) and EPSU  (2nd field of entry 2) - In the present problem, this is taken as UV. U
indicates displacement control and V indicates the vector component method. The ratio of the maximum iterative
change in the displacement over the maximum incremental change in the displacement is calculated. Convergence
is established when this ratio is &amp;lt; EPSU  (0.1 in the present problem). Note that, by default, for V style checking,
separate checks are made over translational degrees of freedom and over rotational degrees of freedom. If the
rotational check is deemed to be unnecessary, use can be made of the MSCLPRM,MRCONV,N,  in which N is
set to 2 or 3 to by-pass the rotation check.&lt;/p&gt;

MAXBIS  (2nd field of entry 3) - controls the maximum number of bisections allowed for each time step. In the
present problem, this number is set to 0. It should be noted that the penetration check and possible time-step
cutback is independent of the value of MAXBIS  or DTBIS  (the smallest bisection time possible).
ADJUST  (3rd field of entry 3) - controls the time step skip factor for automatic time step adjustment. The blank
field allows ADJUST  to default to 5 in the present problem. A non-zero ADJUST  value allows the following
additional checks at the end of an increment:
•After the first 2 increments wherein the user-given time-step is used, the analysis is restarted with either the same
time step or possibly a smaller time-step. If the prescribed time step violates frequency-based time step estimates,
then the first 2 increments are repeated with the program-evaluated time step. This restart allows good accuracy
at the start of the analysis if a high initial time step has been prescribed.
•At a frequency of every ADJUST  increments, the dominant frequency of the system is estimated and is used to
evaluate the optimal time step. The number of steps ( MSTEP ) to resolve this dominant period can be defined
by the user (4th field of entry 3). MSTEP  defaults to 10 (for mildly non-linear) and 20 (for highly non-linear).
The time step for subsequent increments is reduced by a factor of ½ or ¼ if the optimal time step is smaller
than the current time step. Similarly, the time step for subsequent increments is increased by a factor of 2 or 4
if the optimal time step is larger than the current time step.
•The final optimal time step for the next increment is based on two algorithms - the frequency algorithm (which
allows both increase and decrease in time steps and is only checked when ADJUST  &amp;gt; 0) and the output algorithm
(which is independent of the ADJUST  value). After the frequency algorithm comes up with predicted time step,
the time step may again be adjusted such that it satisfies the frequency requirement and becomes an even sub-
multiple (1, 1/2, ¼, etc.) of the required output time. Note that if the time step is reduced arbitrarily due to a
penetration cutback, then the time steps for the next few increments may be changed unevenly before they
become regularized.

Figure 29-4 shows the final deformed shape of the fabric in two views. The contact status is displayed as well. The latter is
1 at the grid points of beam elements in contact and 0 otherwise and indicates that the yarns are in contact at the crossings.
The displacement in the basic Z-direction of the rigid sphere is plotted as a function of time in Figure 29-5 for different
friction coefficients and for standard beam elements with only a PBEAM  property as well as for beam elements with a PBEMN1&lt;br&gt;
nonlinear extension. The first conclusion that can be drawn from this figure is the fact that, in the elastic regime, the
standard beam element and the beam element with the nonlinear extension give basically the same results. The difference,
of course, is that the beam element with PBEMN1  extension can also be used with material non-linearities, such as
plasticity effects. The second thing that stands out is the effect of the friction. Due to friction, the yarns more-or-less stick
to each other, so there is less sliding and the fabric behaves stiffer than without friction. This can also be seen from
Figure 29-6, in which the final deformed shapes are drawn for the frictionless case and the case with friction.&lt;/p&gt;

The beam-to-beam contact algorithm is a symmetric algorithm, in the sense that the same contact condition is found,
whether beam element A is touching beam element B, or element B is touching element A. This means that the choice of
the secondary a nd primary c ontact bodies on the BCTABLE  entry is less important for beam-to-beam contact than it is for
the standard grid-to-segment based contact. For the latter, the proper choice of secondary a nd primary m ay be critical in
certain cases, particularly if the mesh densities of the bodies differ significantly.
In this chapter, no nonlinear material effects such as plasticity, are considered. The standard CBEAM  element with only a
PBEAM  or PBEAML  property supports only elastic material behavior, but if the nonlinear extension PBEMN1  is used in
combination with the PBEAML  property, nonlinear material effects can be taken into account. The PBEAML  can then
refer to, for example, a MATBV  material with an associated MATEP  entry, to include plasticity effects. Note that the shape of
the cross-section must be known to the program to be able to do the cross-section integration, required for nonlinear
material behavior. Therefore, a beam element with a PBEAM  property cannot support nonlinear material effects, not even
with a PBEMN1  extension.
In the present problem, the output frequency NO is defined as 1. This causes output at every step and also prevents the time
step from increasing beyond the initial value (5e-7 seconds). In many contact / impact problems, it is beneficial to have a
time step value that does not exceed the user-prescribed initial time step value - however one may not desire a NO value of
1 always since that may cause very large output file sizes. For such cases, a larger value of NO (NO = 5, 10 , etc.) can be
prescribed and ADJUST  can be set to 0. The ADJUST = 0  setting forces the program to by-pass the frequency check thereby
preventing any time step increase and the output algorithm ensures that the time step is regularized as quickly as possible
and that output is produced whenever the time reaches NO times DT.

Introduction
This demonstration problems manual, written for those with a working knowledge of Nastran, highlights the steps
necessary to use the advanced features of MSC Nastran , including contact, elastic-plastic creep, elastomeric material
nonlinearities and heat transfer. The subsequent application examples focus on how to include these advanced features by
making relatively modest changes to existing MSC Nastran bulk data files using either a text editor or using a pre- and post-
processing program s like Patran or SimXpert .
Every application example has a working input file(s) available to simulate the results found in each chapter, and upon
clicking its name, it will be downloaded into your browser to use. Once an understanding of how to invoke a new feature
has been reached, you are encouraged to experiment by changing some of the input parameters and rerunning the
application. Furthermore, as confidence grows, these models can serve as stepping stones to more complex simulations that
can help you better understand and improve your simulations .

Introduction
A steel cylinder is pressed into an aluminum block. It is assumed that the material  behavior for both materials is linear
elastic. The cylinder is loaded by a point load  with magnitude F = 35 kN  in the vertical direction. A 2-D approximation
(plane  strain) of this problem is assumed to be representative for the solution. An analytical  solution for the frictionless case
is known - (Ref: NAFEMS, 2006, Advanced Finite Element Contact Benchmarks , Benchmark 1 2D Cylinder Roller
Contact).
Solution Requirements
There are two solutions: one using a friction coefficient of 0.1 between the cylinder and block and one  frictionless.
Length of contact zone
Normal pressure distribution as function of distance (x-coordinate) along the contact surface
Tangential stress distribution as function of distance along the contact surface
These solutions demonstrate:
More elements near the contact zone
Which surface is treated as primary ( contacting) and secondary ( contacting)
The analysis results are presented with linear and parabolic elements.FE results 1.Plot of normal contact pressure against distance from center of contact

Analytical Solution
An analytical solution for this contact problem can be obtained from the Hertzian  contact formulae (Hertz, H., Über die
Berührung fester elasticher Körper. J. Reine Angew. Mathm. 92, 156-171, 1881) for two cylinders (line contact). The
maximum contact pressure  is given by:
where  is the applied normal force,  the combined elasticity modulus,  the length of the cylinder and   the
combined radius.
The contact width  is given by:
Using the normalized coordinate  with  the Cartesian x-coordinate, the  pressure distribution is given by:
The combined elasticity modulus is determined from the modulus of elasticity and  Poisson’s ratio of the cylinder and block
, , , and , as follows:
The combined radius of curvature is evaluated from the radius of curvature of the  cylinder and block  and
, as follows:
For the target solution, the block is approximated with an infinitely large radius. The  combined radius is then evaluated as:

Note that half the contact length is equal to 6.21 mm which corresponds to  approximately 7.1 degrees of the ring. Hence,
it is clear that, in order to simulate this  problem correctly, a very fine mesh near the contact zone is needed.
FEM Solutions
A numerical solution has been obtained with MSC Nastran’s solution sequence 400 ( SOL400) for the element mesh shown
in Figure 1-1 using plane strain linear elements. The elements in the entire cylinder and entire block have been selected as
contact bodies with the BCBODY  and BSURF  entries. Contact body IDs 1 and 2 are identified as a set of elements of the block
and cylinder respectively as:
BCBODY1        1       1      2D  DEFORM       6     &lt;br&gt;
BSURF          6    1929    THRU    3856                                +&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;      4197    THRU    4536                                        
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BCBODY1        2       1      2D  DEFORM       7     &lt;br&gt;
BSURF          7    4937    THRU    5336                                +   &lt;br&gt;
Furthermore, the BCTABL1 entries shown below identify that these bodies can touch each other:
BCTABL1        0       1
BCTABL1        1       1
BCTABL1        2       1
Thus, any deformable contact body is simply a collection of mutually exclusive elements and their associated nodes. The
order of these bodies is important and is discussed later.  For the simulations with friction, a bilinear Coulomb model is
used (FTYPE = 6 ). The secondary o r contacting nodes are contained in the elements in the cylinder, whereas the primary
nodes  or nodes or contacted segments are contained in the elements in the block.pmax3585.37Nmm2 =&lt;/p&gt;

In many applications, the power dissipation inside integrated circuits is transient in nature. The device maybe turned on
for 10 seconds or less. The above model ( Figure 30-1) consists of D2pak copper tab mounted on the aluminum heat sink.
Due to the symmetry, only a quarter of the model is meshed.

&lt;p&gt;We are running a total 600 time steps with equal steps of 0.02 seconds and output the temperature at every 5th step. This
means that the temperature will then be output at 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 seconds, respectively. Also we can use the Method called
FIXED  and the convergence is set on the error on temperature (U) with 0.01 as the error tolerance. Grid point 195 is the
fastest responding in the copper tab; it is also used in subsequent graphs to illustrate how fast the chip heats up and cools
down.

The SPOINT  2556 is on the field 5 (CNTRLND) on the CONV , and the SPOINT 2555 is on the field 6 (TA1). The field 6
on the MAT4  option is the convection coefficient times the TABLED1  ID 2 where this a function of time. At time equal to
zero, the value is equal to 0.02, and time equal to 10 seconds, the value is 0.03.
For SPOINT 2556, we used SPCD and SPC1 to specify enforced temperature as a function of time. The value of 1.0 that
specified on the field 5 on the SPCD  bulk data entry actually is a scale multiplier to the TABLED1  ID 2 that it refers to.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

The ambient temperature is constant at 25oC, but we could make it time dependent as well. It is important that for any
enforced temperature as a function of time or any use of a control node in RADBC  or CONV  bulk data entries, that a value of
1 is specified on field 5 on the TLOAD1  or TLOAD2  entry to indicate that this refers to the SPCD .
Modeling Tips
The transient thermal analysis involved a lot more data compared to a steady state thermal analysis since every time step
requires a temperature distribution. It is sensible to monitor those nodes that handle the time-dependent boundary
conditions. In this case, the convection coefficient as a function of time is applied to SPOINT 2556 which, when plotted
as a graph in SimX, should behave as described by the input. The other point of interest is where the heat load is applied.
Adaptive time stepping facilitates capturing transient thermal behavior more precisely than uniform stepping, because the
length of each time step changes based upon changes in temperature. To invoke adaptive time stepping requires the
nonlinear procedure defined through the NLSTEP  entry:
NLSTEP,6,12.0
,GENERAL,10,1,10
,ADAPT,0.001,1.0E-5,0.5
,HEAT,U,1.0E-6,1.0E-6,1.0E-6,AUTO
and a backward Euler thermal operator with the NDAMP  parameter:
PARAM,NDAMP,0.5
This will run for a total time period of 12 seconds with an initial time step of 12/1000. The minimum time step is 12*1e-
5; the convergence is set to U and is at 1e-6. The allowable range of the NDAMP, NDAMPM  parameter is -2.414 to 0.414, and
any NDAMP  value that violates this range is reset to the closest allowable value. Here it triggers the backward Euler
operator. (NDAMP = 0  would be the Crank-Nicholson operator). The adaptive time stepping would avoid the small
oscillation seen in Figure 30-4 since the backward Euler operator is both stable and immune to oscillations. The input files&lt;br&gt;
nug_45c.dat  and nug_45d.dat  use this operator.&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction
This problem demonstrates the ability of MSC Nastran SOL 400 to model shape memory materials. The most common
materials which have shape memory properties are alloys of nickel and titanium. The shape memory effect is due to a phase
change between martensite and austenite phases in the alloy. These phases have identical chemistry but different crystalline
structures; body-centered-tetragonal for martensite and face-centered-cubic for austenite. T ransitioning between these two
phases requires only a small amount of activation energy giving the transformation. A cold collapsed stent sheathed in a
catheter can be deployed in a plaque lined blood vessel by the self-expansion caused by the change in room to body
temperature, with the stent expansion keeping the vessel open and blood flowing properly. In other words, the stent’s
“remembered” shape keeps the blood vessel open.The martensite phase forms when the material is cooled down, or it can
form when stress is applied to a hot material. In this phase extensive deformation can occur as a thermoelastic martensitic
shear mechanism. This deformation can be undone when the material is re-heated, or at simple unloading of a hot material.
When a hot (unstrained) specimen is cooled it is initially in the austenite phase. Upon cooling between martensite start
and martensite finish  temperature the specimen will change to the martensite phase. Conversely starting from a
cold specimen which is in a martensic phase upon heating between austenite start  and austenite finish  temperatures,
the specimen will change to the austenite phase. Different temperature ranges can be distinguished ,
, , where  is defined as the temperature above which the yield strength of the austenite phase
is lower than the stress required to induce the austenite-martensite transformation. Uniaxial tensile tests will show the
following responses. For , the specimen is completely in the martensite phase. The stress versus strain curves will
display a smooth parabolic type behavior, the deformation is caused by the movement of defects such as twin boundaries
and the boundaries between variants. Unloading occurs nearly elastically and the accumulated deformation caused by the
reorientation of the existing martensite and the transformation of any pre-existing austenite, remains after the specimen is
completely unloaded. Note that the deformation is entirely due to oriented martensite and this would be recoverable upon
heating to temperatures above the ( ) range. This would show the shape memory effect. For , the
specimen shows pseudo elastic behavior. In this range the specimen is in the austenite phase, and stress induced martensite
is formed, along with the associated deformation; upon unloading the martensite is unstable and reverts to austenite
thereby undoing the accumulated deformation. For  when the stress is higher than the yield stress no phase
transition takes place, and the austenite phase will deform plastically which cannot be undone. Figure 31-1 shows thermo-
mechanical response of NiTi, the data is of Miyazaki  et al.  (1981). In this case, , ,
, and . T wo different models are available to simulate the shape memory behavior: a
mechanical model, and a thermo-mechanical model. The thermo-mechanical model describes the complete behavior as
discussed before. The mechanical model only describes the super elastic behavior, and thus can only be used at higher
temperatures. In this example, a stent will be analyzed at different ambient temperatures. Simple loading and unloading is
applied. Stress-strain graphs will show the response at the different ambient temperatures. MsMf

Figure 31-2 shows a representation of the stent which is modeled. At a prescribed ambient temperature the stent is loaded
and unloaded by prescribing the displacement in the z-direction. For modeling reasons isotropic material is chosen at the
end parts of the stent. In this way no local effects will occur where the displacements are prescribed. Smaller steps are chosen
during the unloading part. Small steps are also needed to capture the shape memory behavior.

Two STEP (Case)S are defined to do the loading and the unloading. It is possible to obtain extra post quantities to examine

Large displacement effects are included in the nonlinear analysis using the large strain option:
NLMOPTS LRGS    1
For the mechanical model the multiplicative decomposition formulation is used, this is set automatically for the elements
using this material behavior. It can be activated for the whole model using
NLMOPTS LRGS    2
Element Modeling
Besides the standard options to define the element connectivity and grid coordinate location, the bulk data section contains
various options which are especially important to do nonlinear analysis, and are needed to be able to use shape memory
material. The nonlinear extensions to lower-order solid element, CHEXA  can be activated by using the PSLDN1  property
option to the regular PSOLID  property option in the manner shown below:
PSOLID   1       1       0
PSLDN1   1       1       1                                             +&lt;/p&gt;

The PLSLDN1  option allows the element to be used with different kinds of inelastic material models, one being the shape
memory model. This element is also used in both large displacement and large strain analyses and has no restrictions on
the kinematics of deformation unlike the regular CHEXA elements with only PSOLID  property entry.
Material Modeling
The material properties for the thermo-mechanical model is given using the MATSMA  option. The mechanical model uses
a subset of these properties. The following material properties for the shape memory material are used:
This data corresponds to temperature ranges where the martensite  austenite phase transformations take place at
, , and , , where . The initial volume fraction of
martensite is taken  for all cases except for the case where , then the volume fraction of
martensite is .

Loading and Boundary Conditions
The loading is prescribed by a displacement of  in the z-direction. For unloading, the displacement goes back to
zero. T o improve stability, the nodes are only allowed to move in the radial and axial direction. To obtain this, a cylindrical
coordinate system is applied to each node using the CORD2R  option, and the tangential movement is fixed.Young’s modulus

30 Increments are used for the loading and 60 increments for the unloading. T wo STEP (Case)S are defined to do the loading
and unloading. The analysis is performed at different ambient temperatures to study the material behavior, respectively.
Results
Analyses are performed for the thermo-mechanical and mechanical models at different temperatures. Figure 31-3 shows the
stress-strain relationship for one node (node number 1292) at different ambient temperatures for the thermo-mechanical
model. The z-component of the stress and strain of this node is collected during the loading and unloading and plotted in
the figure. At  an analysis is performed with a martensite volume fraction of 0% and an analysis with a
volume fraction of 100% . Note that for 0% martensite no plastic behavior occurs. If no martensite is present no plastic
behavior can occur, and due to the low temperature no martensite can form due to stress. Physically this would however
be an unstable situation, and the martensite volume fraction should be set. This is different for  where
martensite will form if none is present, and the material will show plastic behavior. Also note that since these are
temperatures below  the plastic deformation cannot be undone. This only happens for the case where
, and . The simulation for  stops prematurely, because it cannot find convergence.
The material behavior can be sensitive during unloading, in this case reducing the timestep further did not help. What
would help to get convergence in this case is to refine the mesh.
Figure 31-4 compares the results of the mechanical model with the thermo-mechanical model. The mechanical model is
designed to simulate the super-elastic behavior, so it should be used for higher temperatures. The results show a similar
response.
Modeling Tips
The behavior of the shape memory material can be quite sensitive to the loading. Therefore, the user must use sufficiently
small timesteps, and the mesh should be fine enough. It is best to use the PFNT  option of NLPARM  for stability.T 150Co–=

Introduction
The 3-D contact capability introduced in MSC Nastran supported a general node to surface contact in all translational
degrees of freedom. The feature of shell edge to shell edge contact was added in the R3 release of MSC Nastran. The
following two cases are considered to demonstrate two different types of shell edge contact.
Solution Requirements
MSC Nastran&amp;rsquo;s solution sequences 103 and 400 are used to demonstrate the shell edge contact capability with the two test
cases. The details of the finite element model, contact simulation, material, load, boundary conditions, and solution
procedure for these two models are discussed below.
Case 1:  T wo equal parts of rhombic plate are meshed with different mesh densities of 16 x 32 and 20 x 40 CQUAD4  elements.
These two parts do not share any node at their common edge as they are connected using in-plane glued edge contact. The
FE model used for the modal analysis ( SOL 103) shown in Figure 32-1 and the case control section part of the input is given
below:Applied loads Case 2: Move top edge of top tube down two inches.

Case 1: Modal analysis of thick rhombic plate. This is a NAFEMS test case involving evaluation of
natural frequencies of a fully clamped rhombic plate. The plate is divided into two equal parts
in the vertical direction. These two parts are meshed with different mesh densities and then
connected with in-plane glued edge contact.
Case 2: Diagonal crushing of two square tubes. This model demonstrate the capability of general shell
edge contact by crushing the lower square tube with the upper square tube as a result of the edge
contact between the two tubes.

Material Modeling
The isotropic, Hookean elastic material properties of the deformable body for Case 1 are defined in the SI (international)
system using the following MATBV  option:
MAT1     1      2.+11           .3      8000.
The MATBV  entry for Case 2 is given in the same system below:
MAT1     1      2.1+11          .3      1.
Element Modeling
Besides the standard options to define the element connectivity and grid coordinate location, the bulk data section contains
various options with special relevance to nonlinear analysis. For the SOL 400 analysis of Case 2, the nonlinear extensions
to the lower-order shell element, CQUAD4, are activated by using the PSHLN1  property option in conjunction with the
regular PSHELL  property option in the manner shown below:
PSHELL   1       1      .05      1               1
PSHLN1   1       1
C4      DCT     L&lt;br&gt;
For the modal analysis of Case 1, regular CQUAD4  elements are defined using the following PSHELL option.
PSHELL   1       1      1.       1               1
Modeling Contact
The BCPARA  option used for the Case 2 model is given below. It defines the number of bodies in contact, together with the
maximum number of contact entities (e.g. patches), nodes on the periphery of the contact surfaces and bias factor. The
general shell edge contact option is enabled by activating the beam to beam contact flag BEAMB .
BCPARA   0    BIAS   .95      BEAMB   1
The definition of the contact bodies consists of the BCBODY  Bulk Data Entry which defines the deformable body including
the body ID, dimensionality, type of body, type of contact constraints and friction, etc. while the BSURF  identifies the
elements forming a part of the deformable body. The following BCBODY  entries are used for cases 1 and 2. Figure 32-2
identifies the contact bodies used in both these models.

Figure 32-2  Contact Status Plot for Modal Analysis (Case 1)
To identify the interaction between the contact bodies, the BCTABLE  Bulk Data Option is used. BCTABLE  with ID 0 is
used to define the touching conditions at the start of the analysis. This is an optional entry required in SOL 400 for contact
analysis and it is flagged in the case control section through the optional BCONTACT (Case) = 0 option. The BCTABLE&lt;br&gt;
with ID 1 is used to define the touching conditions for later increments in the analysis, and it is flagged using BCONTACT
= 1 in the Case Control Section.
A contact option, COPTxfamily , in BCTABLE  allows more advanced control on how the contact bodies should interact with
each other. COPTxfamily  is defined using the formula COPTx=A+10&lt;em&gt;B+1000&lt;/em&gt;C , where the terms A, B, and C are defined
as follows:
A: the outside of the solid elements in the body
B (flexible bodies): the outside of the shell elements in the body
Note if B = 6  for both bodies in a contact combination, then nodes that separate from a body, cannot come in contact
again in the current step or in subsequent steps unless a different flag is chosen for one of the bodies.= 1: the outside will be in the contact description ( DEFAULT )

B (rigid bodies): the rigid surface
C (flexible bodies): the edges of the body
Note that C has no effect if beam-to-beam contact is not switched on (i.e., BEAMB  is left as 0 on BCPARA ).
The following BCTABLE  entries are used for the SOL 103 analysis of Case 1:
BCTABLE  1                       1

It is important to note that the in-plane edge glued contact is activated by assigning value 60 for COPTS1  and COPTM1  in
the 4th line of the BCTABLE  option. The value 60 (B = 6) signifies that the edges are checked for contact without taking
the shell thickness into account. Glued contact is defined by using a value of 3 for IGLUE  in the 2nd line of the BCTABLE&lt;br&gt;
option. The value of IGLUE=3  allows moments to be transmitted across the contacting interface. JGLUE=0  in the 5th field
of the 2nd line following keyword SECNDRY e nsures that glued nodes do not separate during the modal analysis. The
contact status plot for Case 1 is presented in Figure 32-2.
For the SOL 400 analysis of Case 2, the regular shell edge contact option is activated by assigning value of 10010 (B=1 and
C=10) for COPTS1  and COPTM1  in the following BCTABLE  entries:

The number of increments is provided in the 3rd field of the 1st line of NLPARM  option. PFNT  represents Pure Full
Newton Raphson technique wherein the stiffness is reformed at every iteration. The value of KSTEP=1  along with PFNT&lt;br&gt;
option indicates that the stiffness matrix will not be updated between the convergence of a load increment and the start of
the next load increment. PV indicates that the maximum vector component of the residuals will be checked for
convergence. NO indicates that intermediate output will not be produced after every increment. The second line of
NLPARM  indicates that a tolerance of 0.1 will be used for convergence checking. The nonlinear procedure also deactivates
Quasi-Newton, line search and cutbacks by assigning the value of 0 for MAXQN , MAXLS , and MAXBIS .

Frequencies of 6 modes extracted from the modal analysis are indicated in the Table 32-1. It clearly shows that the in -plane
glued edge contact can be successfully used to assemble parts with different mesh densities, since the predictions are within

Modeling Tips
The most important aspect in the shell edge contact analysis is the COPT  options introduced in BCTABLE . This gives more
flexibility for users to define the interaction between different contact bodies (solid or shell or beam elements). Readers can
observe the changes in results for the two cases presented in this chapter by removing the COPT  options in BCTABLE .
It is also possible to define the COPTx  options in the BCBODY  option. The option COPTB  in the BCBODY  option can be
used to define the same COPTx  option in cases where BCTABLE  is not used in the model with BCONTACT (Case) =ALLBODY&lt;br&gt;
option. This is recommended as an exercise for the readers.
It is important to remember that the general shell edge contact capability is activated by setting the beam to beam contact
flag option BEAMB  to 1 in BCPARA  entry.

Introduction
This example demonstrates the modeling and analysis of a lap joint. T wo plates are joined using a riveted connection. Three
methods of modeling the rivets are considered, resulting in three different analysis models. In the first two, the rivets are
modeled with bushing elements since their flexibility is given by an empirical expression. They are connected to the plates
using a point-to-point or a patch-to-patch connection. The third method models the rivets with beam elements and
connects them to the plates using patch-to-patch connections.
The first method uses a point-to-point connection and requires the bushing elements to be defined explicitly as CBUSH&lt;br&gt;
elements, together with its grids. The grids of the bushing elements need to coincide with grids of the plate elements, so
this imposes a limitation on how the plates can be meshed, since plate grids must be present at locations where a connection
is desired. Furthermore this method leads to a strongly localized load transfer, especially when the plate mesh is relatively
fine.
The second method uses a patch-to-patch connection, which is modeled using CFAST . This method generates the bushing
elements internally and does not require their grids to be coincident with plate grids. In addition to the bushing element,
a set of constraints is generated internally to connect the bushing grids to the plate elements on each side of the connection.
This eliminates the need of nearly congruent meshes on both sides with grids at the location of the connection.
The third method uses a patch-to-patch connection, which is modeled using CWELD . This method internally generates
beam elements instead of bushing elements, but the way of connecting the beam grids to the plates is the same as for CFAST .
In this case, the stiffness of the rivets is given by the standard beam stiffness formulations for a beam with circular cross-
section having linear elastic material behavior.
The lap joint has three rows of rivets in the loading direction. For this analysis only, a strip (one rivet pitch of 20 mm wide)
of the lap joint is modeled with proper symmetry boundary conditions along the edges of the strip that are parallel to the
xz-plane.
The shear flexibility (see Vlieger, H., Broek, D., “Residual Strength of Cracked Stiffened Panels, Built-up Sheet Structure”,
Fracture Mechanics of Aircraft Structure, AGARD-AG-176, NATO, London, 1974) is calculated as follows:
the axial rivet stiffness is calculated using a simple formula:
These values are entered as the translational stiffness values of the bushing elements. Their rotational stiffness values are
assumed to be zero, but a small torsional stiffness is added to avoid singularities. Beam elements have bending and torsional
stiffness given through their formulation, so there is no risk of singularitiesCs1

A numerical solution has been obtained with MSC Nastran&amp;rsquo;s solution sequence SOL 400 performing a nonlinear static

The analysis contains two subcases essentially analyzing the same type of loading but in different spatial positions. The first
subcase performs one step by applying the tensile load in x-direction. The second subcase performs two steps: the first step
rigidly rotates the lap joint through 45° about the model y -axis and the second step applies the tensile load in this rotated
position. It is clear that the CBUSH  or CBEAM  forces in the connector elements as well as the stress state in the plates at the
end of each subcase must be the same, thus illustrating the large displacement capability of these connections. Each step
defines a nonlinear static analysis via ANALYSIS (Case) , has a definition of convergence control via NLPARM (Case) , fixed
displacements (or single point constraints) via SPC (Case) , forced displacements (in this case a rotation) and applied loads&lt;/p&gt;

The mesh of the lap joint is shown in Figure 33-1 where each plate is meshed by 28 x 6 CQUAD4  elements with 18x6 elements
in the overlap region. Figure 33-1 also displays a zoomed in view of one of the rivets in a patch-to-patch connection and a

Large displacement effects are included in the nonlinear analysis using the option:
PARAM    LGDISP  1
This parameter is needed to account for all geometrically nonlinear effects and is essential even if no large rigid body
rotation is applied prior to loading of the joint.

Modeling the Connections
The input for the three different methods of the connection is summarized below:
Connection method 1: Explicitly define the CBUSH  elements and their properties to make point-to-point connections
between the plates.
$ Connector elements and properties, point-to-point
PBUSH    3       K      3.1416E52.3226E42.3226E4 100.0

CBUSH    339     3       150     283     1.0     0.0     0.0
Each CBUSH  element has two grids entered in fields 4 and 5 and references its properties through the property ID in field
3. In this application, the local x-direction of the CBUSH  element is from the first grid to the second. Fields 6,7, and 8
define an orientation vector lying in the x-y plane (similar to the CBEAM  element). The properties are entered through
PBUSH  and only stiffness values are entered in this model. The K in field 3 indicates that the next values are stiffness values.
The first three are the translational stiffness values: first the axial stiffness followed by two shear stiffness values. The next
three are the rotational stiffness values of which only the first (.e., the torsion value) has been entered so the bending values
are zero.

CFAST  and their properties through PFAST .

Each CFAST  fastener element internally generates a CBUSH  element and a number of RBE3 elements to connect the CBUSH&lt;br&gt;
grids through a number of auxiliary grids to the plates. The approximate location of each fastener is entered as the GS grid

first direction from the first grid to the second of the CBUSH  element. Field 6, 7, and 8 specify the translational stiffness
values, where the first is the axial stiffness (in the element local x -direction) and the next two are the shear stiffness values.
The next three fields specify the rotational stiffness values of which only the first (i.e., the torsion value) has been entered,
so the bending values are zero. The GS grids are used to determine the end node locations of the CBUSH  elements. The
surface on each side of a connection is identified by a PSHELL  property ID. The nearest projection point of the GS grid on
the shell elements sharing this property ID defines a grid point of the internally generated CBUSH  element. Four auxiliary
grids are positioned around each projection point forming a square auxiliary patch.
The connection is established by connecting the CBUSH  grids to the auxiliary patches with RBE3  elements and
connecting the auxiliary grids to the plate structure with RBE3 elements. Thus each fastener involves one CBUSH  and ten
RBE3  elements which are being generated internally. Any unspecified CBUSH  grids and the auxiliary grids are also
generated internally.

Each CWELD  weld element internally generates a CBEAM  element and a number of RBE3 elements to connect the CBEAM&lt;br&gt;
grids through a number of auxiliary grids to the plates. The approximate location of each weld is entered as the GS grid in
field 4 of the CWELD  input. The two plates on each side of the connection are identified through their property IDs in
fields 12 and 13 (i.e. fields 2 and 3 of the second input line) and the connection method PARTPAT  is specified in field 5.
Each CWELD  references its properties through a PWELD  property ID entered in field 3. The properties of the weld are
defined in the PWELD  input. The weld diameter is entered in field 4 and is used to compute the locations of the auxiliary
grids and the cross-section properties of the beam. The weld material data are referenced through a material ID in field 3.
The GS grids are used to determine the end node locations of the CBEAM  elements. The surface on each side of a
connection is identified by a PSHELL  property ID. The nearest projection point of the GS grid on the shell elements sharing
this property ID defines a grid point of the internally generated CBEAM element. Four auxiliary grids are positioned
around each projection point forming a square auxiliary patch. The connection is established by connecting the CBEAM&lt;br&gt;
grids to the auxiliary patches with RBE3 elements and connecting the auxiliary grids to the plate structure with RBE3
elements. Thus each weld involves one CBEAM  and ten RBE3  elements which are being generated internally. Any
unspecified CBEAM  grids and the auxiliary grids are also generated internally.
The internally generated grids get IDs with high offsets w.r.t. the grids entered in the input. In a similar way, internally
generated RBE3 s get IDs with high offsets with regard to the elements entered in the input. The internally generated
CBUSH  or CBEAM  elements retain the element ID of the CFAST  or CWELD  from which they originate.

The nonlinear procedure used is defined through the following NLPARM  entry:

PFNT  represents the “Pure” Full Newton Raphson technique where the stiffness is updated every iteration. KSTEP  (the field
following PFNT ) is left blank and in conjunction with PFNT , it indicates that stiffness needs to be updated between the end
of a load increment and the start of the next load increment. 25 is the maximum number of allowed recycles for every
increment. U indicates that convergence testing will be done based on the displacement error. UP indicates that convergence
testing will be done based on the displacement error and the load equilibrium error. NO indicates that result output will be
produced at the end of every step. The second line of NLPARM  indicates that tolerances of 0.0001 will be used for
convergence checking.&lt;/p&gt;

The number of increments is provided in the 3rd field of the NLPARM  option and since no adaptive load stepping has
been activated all increments will be of equal size. The NLPARM  with ID = 1 is used to control the rigid body rotation of
45° in step 1 of subcase 2. Thus, each increment makes a rotation of 1°. Since the motion is a rigid body motion, the lap
joint remains stress free and there are no loads acting on the joint. Therefore, only displacement convergence testing is done
during this phase, no load convergence testing. The NLPARM  with ID = 2 is used to control the loading of the lap joint
in step 1 of subcase 1 and step 2 of subcase 2. Thus, the total load is applied in ten equal load increments. During this
phase, the lap joint no longer remains stress free and both displacement and load convergence testing are activated.
Results
Figure 33-2, Figure 33-3, and Figure 33-4 show the equivalent stress distribution for the three connection methods. Only the
overlap region is shown here because the stresses near the rivets are of primary interest. It can be observed that the maximum
equivalent stress in the point-to-point connection displayed in Figure 33-2 is higher than the maximum equivalent stress in
the patch-to-patch connection shown in Figure 33-3. This is as expected since the patch-to-patch connection provides a less
localized load transfer in the connection. A difference can also be observed between the CFAST  and CWELD  connections.
With the CFAST  connection, there is direct control over the stiffness values in the different deformation modes of the
element (axial, shear, bending and torsion deformations); whereas with the CWELD , these stiffness values are determined
by the underlying beam formulations. There is clearly an advantage for the CFAST  when the stiffness values are known
from empirical expressions based on a detailed investigation of the connections in question. The stress state shown is at the
end of step 1 in subcase 1. It can easily be verified that the stress state at the end of step 2 in subcase 2 is the same, illustrating
the proper handling of the large rotation.

Table 33-1 lists the shear force in the three rivets for the three connection methods. These results are taken from the output
at the end of step 1 of subcase 1. It can easily be verified that these results at the end of step 2 in subcase 2 are the same.
Figure 33-5 shows the deformed configuration of the overlap region in the patch-to-patch connection with CFAST  at the
end of step 1 in subcase 1. Clearly an effect of geometrical nonlinearity can be observed as the joint shows the tendency to
align the lower and upper plates in the direction of the external load. The plot shows the deformations in true scale. It can
easily be verified that the other two models display a similar behavior.Table 33-1  Rivet Shear Forces

Modeling Tips
For geometrically complicated structures, modeling riveted joints (or similar types of spot connections) with point-to-point
connections using CBUSH  elements (or other line type elements like CBEAM ) can be a labor intensive task since it requires
meshes with hard points at the rivet locations. Making such congruent or near congruent meshes may prove to be very
difficult. Moreover this type of connection creates stress singularities at the point of connection, because of the highly
localized load transfer. CFAST  and CWELD  connections can eliminate these drawbacks, since more grids near the point of
connection are involved in the load transfer. The patch-to-patch type connection methods involving auxiliary patches are
preferred when the area of the connector element is large with respect to the size of the element faces to which the
connection is made. In general this improves the accuracy of the load transfer between the connected surfaces.
CFAST  has more flexibility to define the mechanical properties, because the stiffness values for the different deformation
modes of the element (i.e. axial, shear, bending, and torsion deformation) can be specified independently. With CWELD ,
the stiffness values follow from the underlying beam formulations.

Introduction
This problem demonstrates the ability of the Nastran SOL 400 nonlinear solution sequence to perform a creep analysis using
adaptive time stepping. A stainless steel oval is pressurized at a uniformly high temperature and over time allowed creep.
The details of the finite element model, material and creep properties, load, boundary conditions, solution procedure, and
adaptive creep stepping are discussed below.

Element Modeling
The FE-mesh of the tube is shown in Figure 34-1. The model consists of 200 4-node plane strain elements and 255 nodes.
Only half of the tube is modeled due to symmetry. The symmetric conditions are applied to suppress rigid body motions.Applied loads •A pressure of 66 psi is applied to the inner surface of the tube in the first load step
within the second. This is to apply pressure load at the beginning of analysis.
•At the second load step, the pressure load remains unchanged for 1000 hours
during the creep step.

Besides the standard options to define the element connectivity and grid coordinate location, the bulk data section contains
various options which are especially important for nonlinear analysis. The nonlinear extensions to lower-order plane strain
element CQUAD4  can be activated by using the PSHLN2  property option in addition to the regular PLPLANE  property option:
PLPLANE  1       1     &lt;br&gt;
PSHLN2   1       1       1       1.0                              +&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  C4       PLSTRN  L
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PSHLN2  option allows the element to be used in both large displacement and large strain analysis and has no
restrictions on the kinematics of deformation unlike the regular CQUAD4 elements with only the PLPLANE  property
entry. These standard elements are more suitable for large rotations but small strain analysis due to their linear formulation
in the co-rotational system. While the difference may be small or even negligible in a truly linear analysis, nonphysical
behavior may be seen in the results from analyses in which the linear assumptions are exceeded and these options are not
used.

Creep and large strain effects are included in the nonlinear analysis using the NLMOPTS  option:
NLMOPTS,CREEP,
,LRGSTRN,1,
,ASSM,ASSUMED
The CREEP  field activates the creep analysis. The LRGSTRN  field indicates the use of large displacement, large rotation
kinematics and large strains of the element.
Because it is an analysis with isotropic, elastic Hookean material, and the large strain option is on, the assumed strain
formulation is toggled on with the NLMOPTS input. The assumed strain formulation provides better bending behavior
for the continuum elements.

load step, the pressure remains unchanged for seconds to allow the material to creep. Each step has a convergence control
via NLSTEP (Case) , single point constraints via SPC (Case) , LOAD (Case)  via FORCE , and the displacements and stress results for
the.f06  (output) file. The NLOUT  entry specifies the quantities of output sought via Cauchy stress, creep strain, and
equivalent creep strain.
The nonlinear procedure used is defined through the following NLSTEP (Case)  entry. In the first load step:
NLSTEP      1   1.00E-09
GENERAL       40       0      10       0

MECH      PV    0.00    .100E-010.00        PFNT       0       3
$
The total time of this step is 1.0E-09 with fixed stepping of one increment. The PV method is used for convergence control
with the tolerance as 0.01 and with stiffness update method as PFNT  signifying full Newton Raphson procedure with
stiffness being updated during every iteration.
In the second load step, the load stepping is controlled by the following NLSTEP (Case)  entry:
NLSTEP      2   3.47e6

Introduction
This example demonstrates the ability of the MSC Nastran SOL 400 nonlinear solution sequence to hydro-form a square
pan using pressure loads. Such problems exhibit geometrical instability because of the formation of wrinkles during the
forming process, posing substantial challenges for the analysis. These challenges require a robust algorithm to steer through
convergence process during the forming. Artificial damping, demonstrated herein, shows its capability to deal with such
wrinkling instabilities.
Solution Requirements
A numerical solution has been obtained with MSC Nastran&amp;rsquo;s SOL 400 for a 3-D representation of the structure with
deformable-to-deformable contact between the two panels. The details of finite element model, contact simulation,
material, load, boundary conditions, and solution procedure are discussed below.
The case control section of the input contains the following options for nonlinear analysis:

The input data shown above defines the analysis type and loading sequences. ANALYSIS (Case) = NLSTATIC  means that the
type of this SOL 400 analysis step is nonlinear quasi-static. One load STEP (Case)  defined in the SUBCASE (Case) . This step
comprises the pressure load application onto the surfaces of the solid and shell elements. The control parameters for the
load stepping and iterative procedures are defined by the bulk data option NLSTEP . The contact table and contact parameters
are given via BCONTACT (Case) . The displacement or rotational constraints are applied via SPC1. The pressure loads are applied
via two PLOAD4  entries, one for the shell surface (body2) and the other for the upper surface of the solid body (body1).
The large strain and geometrical nonlinear characteristics are activated by the NLMOPTS /LRGS  and LGDISP  options,
respectively:
NLMOPTS  LRGS    1
PARAM    LGDISP  1
where the NLMOPTS  entry field LRGS =1  triggers the large strain formulation and provides better behavior when plasticity
is present. LGDISP =1  indicates the use of large displacement, large rotation kinematics for the element.
The boundary conditions and pressure loads applied onto the two panels are shown in Figure 35-1. Due to symmetry, only
one quarter of the structure is shown.

Element Modeling
Besides the standard options to define the element connectivity and grid coordinate location, the bulk data section contains
various options which are especially important for nonlinear analysis. The nonlinear extensions to the lower-order solid
element, CHEXA  can be activated by using the PSHLN1  property option in addition to the regular PSOLID  property option:
PSOLID    1       1       0
PSLDN1   1       1
C8      SOLID   LRIH
The PLSLDN1  option allows the element to be used in both large displacement and large strain analysis and has no
restrictions on the kinematics of deformation unlike the regular CHEXA elements with only the PSOLID  property entry.
The 8-node hexahedral element with the reduced integration scheme is very suitable for problem with severe bending
deformation.
The other panel is modeled with shell elements, and activated via two bulk data cards: PSHELL  and PSHLN1 . PSHELL  is
the entry to define the regular shell element in Nastran. PSHLN1  is an extra entry for user to select the advanced shell element
which is more suitable for large strain and rotations:
PSHELL   2       1      2.54     1               1
PSHLN1   2
where 2.54 mm is the thickness of the shell elements.
Modeling Contact
In this example, contact occurs between the solid and shell panels between which glued contact is defined. Therefore no
friction is considered.
To identify how the contact bodies can touch each other, the BCTABLE  option is used. BCTABLE  with ID 0 is used to define
the touching conditions at the start of the analysis. This is a mandatory option required in SOL 400 for contact analysis
and it is flagged in the case control section through the optional BCONTACT = 0  entry. The BCTABLE  with ID 1  is used
to define touching conditions for later increments in the analysis, and is flagged using BCONTACT = 1  in the case control
section. Also, the SECNDRY-PRIMARY c ombination specifies that the corresponding body is a secondary o r primary
body. This, in literature, is variously referred to as either contacting body nodes or tied nodes (imagining the situation of
multi-point constraints). The nodes belonging to body 1 are said to belong to the primary b ody, similarly referred to as the
contacted body nodes or the retained nodes.

The damping algorithm in nug_52a only uses the initial time step information of the ADAPT card. It does not use the
desired number of recycles or the scale factor. The time stepping algorithm (increase of 1.5 or cutback of 0.5) is based on
a comparison of the incremental strain energy and the estimated damping energy.
The recycle based algorithm in nug_52b is based on a comparison of the actual number of recycles taken for convergence
to the desired number of recycles. The time step is allowed to increase if the number of actual Newton-Raphson recycles &amp;lt;
the desired number.
Results
Figure 35-2 shows the sequence of analysis with a close-up view of the square pan when damping is used for the analysis. It
can be seen that a wrinkle develops with the increase of applied pressure. For comparison purposes, another job which does
not use damping is also shown in Figure 35-3. It can be seen that the wrinkles develop more slowly with loading. Without
damping applied, the wrinkling occurs a little earlier and the analysis is extremely unstable. That is why significantly more
iterations are needed at the wrinkling stage. In some cases, this may cause an unsuccessful analysis if the control parameters
are not properly set .

Artificial damping typically acts as an extra strategy for analyses involving wrinkling and snap-through (softening of
materials) for both uniform and adaptive stepping strategies. Furthermore, for the recycle based approach, proper setup of
the adaptive time stepping control parameters can help when conducting nonlinear analysis. In general, the most significant
parameters that influence the number of increments / number of iterations are the initial time step and the desired number
of recycles. Some broad guidelines are as follows: For linear problems, the initial time step ratio can be set as 1.0 and the
desired number of recycles can be set as 4. For mildly nonlinear problems, the initial time step ratio can be set as 0.1 and
the desired number of recycles can be set between 6 - 8. For highly nonlinear problems, the initial time step ratio can be
set as 0.01 and the desired number of recycles can be set between 8 - 10.
Contact analyses, especially with friction, often demonstrate strong nonlinearities due to the frequent touching of a node
or the sliding of a node from its contacting surface. Adding artificial damping will also help improve the stability and the
efficiency of such contact analyses. It is to be noted that in a glued contact between solid and shell elements, the contact
body comprising of the shell elements are to be modeled as the secondary.
The default values for the adaptive time stepping scheme in Sol 400 represent a serious attempt to ensure successful analysis
completion in the general case. However, each problem will be helped by an intelligent choice of control parameters.
Generally, to start with a small time step is always better than a large initial time step, even though the cut back will reduce
the time step, it will cost more time completing the analysis. Also, it is recommended adjusting the desired number of
iterations accordingly if the convergence criteria change. For example, a tight convergence tolerance requires more&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction
Main Index
Introduction
The purpose of this document is to demonstrate the arc-length solution capability of Nastran to solve snap-through
problems using the ARCLN  option in NLSTEP  entry. The example considered is a shallow cylindrical shell structure which
exhibits snap-through and snap-back behaviors under the action of a point load. This problem is widely used by many
researchers to investigate and validate various nonlinear arc-length procedures. The challenge with load control nonlinear
solution methods is that they fail to converge at limit points where the tangent stiffness matrix is singular. Hence, these
methods are not suitable for applications where the response of a structure beyond the limit point is of interest. Although
displacement control methods can capture the snap-through behavior of such problems, they fail at the point where snap-
back begins. The arc-length method which is a path following technique allows the analysis to pass the limit points without
any difficulty.
The model is analyzed in MSC Nastran using the SOL 400 solution sequence. Crisfield’s arc-length scheme is utilized for
the nonlinear solution procedure. Nastran analysis results are compared with that of published solutions (Crisfield, 1981).
Solution Requirements
The geometry of the model, shown in Figure 36-1, is a cylindrical shell with radius R = 2540 mm, length 2L = 508 mm, and
thickness h = 6.35 mm. The straight edges of the structure are pin supported and the curved edges are free. The cylindrical
segment subtends an angle 2  = 0.2 radians with the axis of the cylinder. A point load P is applied at the midpoint of the
shell structure.
Since the structure exhibits bi-planar symmetry, only a quadrant of the geometry is considered for the finite element
analysis. A 6 x 6 shell element mesh is used to discretize the model. The case control options used for the solution sequence

Four node quadrilateral shell elements ( CQUADR ) are used to model the structure. Properties of the elements, such as shell
thickness, are defined through the PSHELL  entry. Additional nonlinear properties for the shell elements corresponding to
PSHELL  are specified using the PSHLN1  option. Keyword C4 indicates that the next two entries in that input line apply to
elements with four corner nodes. DCTN  implies a doubly-curved thin shell element type, and LDK is the integration code.
For thick shell elements, DCT and L options are used for the structural property and integration code, respectively.

The problem is analyzed in MSC Nastran using the SOL 400 routine which is an implicit nonlinear solution procedure.
In the PARAM entry LGDISP = 1  enables the nonlinear large displacement capability with updated element coordinates
and follower forces effect. Control parameters for the nonlinear solution scheme are described through the NLSTEP  entry.
The entries in GENERAL  option are common to all types of analysis. The first three entries denote maximum, minimum

increments are specified in the next two fields.
The sixth entry indicates the desired number of iterations for convergence and the last field implies the maximum number
of increments in the current load case.
The parameters for a mechanical analysis are described through MECH  keyword. The first field flags to select the
convergence criteria. The next two fields indicate the tolerance error for displacement and load. The method for updating
the stiffness matrix is specified in the fifth field. The flag used in the last entry chooses the type of variables to be considered
for error check.
In this analysis, an initial load increment of 0.01, which is 1% of the total load applied, is used. A convergence check on
relative displacement and residual forces is selected and the corresponding tolerance values are 0.001 and 0.001. Nodal
rotations and moments are not included in the convergence check. Pure full Newton-Raphson method is employed for
updating the stiffness matrix which recalculates the tangent stiffness matrix for every iteration.
This problem can be solved alternately by adopting the automatic adaptive load stepping scheme with damping option.
This procedure is initiated with the ADAPT  keyword which replaces the ARCLN  option in the NLSTEP  entry. Initial time step,
minimum and maximum time steps and the desired number of iterations are sequentially specified for the ADAPT  option.
In the next line of input, the flag to activate damping ( IDAMP ) and the damping ratio ( DAMP ) are specified.

Results
Force-deflection response of the structure modeled with thin shell elements is presented in Figure 36-3. The solid blue line
represents the behavior of the node at which the load is applied, and the red line indicates the response of the midpoint of
the free edge. From the response of the midpoint node, it is observed that the structure follows a stable nonlinear path in
the beginning phase of the analysis. As the applied load reaches a value of 596 N, the stiffness matrix approaches singularity
indicating an unstable equilibrium. At this limit point, the structure begins to snap-through and the load-deflection curve
exhibits a downward trend. It is to be noted that the displacement of the node under observation is still in the downward
direction. As the midpoint reaches a position corresponding to a displacement of about 16.7 mm, it begins to move
upwards indicating a snap-back phenomenon. The snap-back behavior lasts till the displacement of the point attains 14.6
mm at which the motion of the midpoint reverses direction again. Snap-through response continues until the load reaches
-366 N after which the load-deflection curve follows a stable equilibrium path.
Figure 36-4 shows a comparison of the solutions obtained with SOL 400 using thin and thick shell elements to the results
of Crisfield (1981). The Nastran results are in reasonable agreement with Crisfield’s solution which is represented by dot
markers in Figure 36-4. The variation in results is due to the difference in the finite element approximation used by Crisfield
(1981) and Nastran. Crisfield (1981) employed rectangular elements with quadratic variation for in-plane displacements
and a restricted quartic non-conforming shape functions for the out-of-plane displacements. This example demonstrates
that the arc-length scheme of MSC Nastran captures the snap-through behavior of shell structures with good accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

Figure 36-5 presents the response of the shallow shell structure solved utilizing the adaptive time stepping procedure with
damping. The figure shows a comparison of load-deflection curves for thick and thin shell models and also between the
adaptive and arc-length solution schemes.
In the first phase of the curve when the structure is in stable equilibrium, the two approaches yield matching results which
indicates that the adaptive times stepping method introduces negligible damping into the system. But, in the vicinity of
the limit point, where the structure approaches an unstable configuration, equilibrium is attained numerically by adding
artificial damping. Beyond this point, while the true equilibrium path follows a downward trend in the snap through and
snap-back regimes, the adaptive time stepping procedure follows a horizontal path as a solution is attempted at a constant
load value of 608N (thin shell model). The strain energy that needs to be relieved by the structure to remain in equilibrium
is dissipated by damping. The constant load response continues until the structure reaches the next undamped stable
configuration corresponding to this load value, after which the path followed by the curve is similar to the arc-length
method. It is to be noted that unlike the arc-length method this approach is not capable of predicting the stable
configurations at load levels below the current load step. But, the damping option is very useful when analyzing
complicated structures posing convergence problems due to local instabilities. In such cases, it must be ensured that energy
dissipated by damping does not exceed a small proportion of internal energy (e.g., 2%) so that the error introduced in the
load-deflection response is within an acceptable limit.&lt;br&gt;

This example illustrates setting up a transient FSI simulation using one of the available OpenFSI CFD partner services
(OpenFSI-AcuSolve service from Acusim here). MSC Nastran calculates the baffle deformation and nodal velocities while
the CFD code calculates the flow induced loads on the baffle wetted surfaces. The initial condition is a converged CFD

is seen in the tip displacement history in Figure 37-2. Since the plate is elastic with no damping, the damping of the tip
oscillation is caused by viscous losses in the fluid flow.

Introduction
A cuboid (5X3X2m) and a quarter cylinder (with a 10m diameter and 10m height) are placed as shown in Figures 38-1
and 38-2. Quarter cylinder (often referred as the shell in this document) is 0.1m thick. One face of the cuboid, measuring
5X2m and away from quarter cylinder, is subjected to a heat flux of 100 W/m2. All the remaining faces of the quarter
cylinder and cuboid are exposed to atmosphere. The simulation demonstrates various capabilities available in the MSC
Nastran SOL 400. This exercise demonstrates heat transfer simulation between two noncontacting deformable bodies due
to natural convection. Automated contact algorithms have been utilized to simulate the heat transfer between the two.

Steady state temperature and heat flux plots are of interest to us. The availability of the nonlinear property extension entry
for shell and solid elements, allows the user to override standard Nastran heat elements. One can run this simulation using
standard Nastran elements. For this, the ANAL  entry is set to IH which refers to the implicit heat analyses elements. The

The contact, material/geometry, convergence, and other parameters used for the natural convection between the two
noncontacting deformable bodies are as follows:
Contact Parameters
The two noncontacting deformable bodies participating in the heat transfer are shown in Figure 38-2. The first body in red,
a deformable solid cube, receives heat directly from a heat source on one of its surface, measuring 5m X 2m and away from
the shell. The second body in green, a quarter cylinder, is the only other body participating in the simulation. Due to
conduction, remaining surfaces of the solid gets heated. The heat is then transfer from solid to shell through thermal

&lt;p&gt;In our case, most of the values have been set to default. T otal time for the load case is set to 1. Since our problem involves
single physics, ‘Fixed’ load time stepping scheme is sufficient. Although the default number of increments is 50 but in a
steady state heat transfer simulation we are only interested in the last step, thus an increment of 2 is sufficient.
HEAT specifies the parameters for heat transfer analysis. PW refers to convergence criteria and is used as default for non
contact problems. The P in PW refers to error tolerance in heat flux criteria and the W refers to error tolerance work criteria.
0.01 is set as the error tolerance for both heat flux and work. Stiffness updates are enabled through AUTO  option.

SUBCASE (Case) 1 indicates the case being considered. BCONTACT (Case) = 1  is used to indicate the contact parameters for
SUBCASE 1 . NLSTEP = 1  is used to flag the nonlinear procedure for SUBCASE 1 . T emperature and heat flux are the two
standard output that have been requested. TEMPERATURE (Case) (INITIAL)  specified initial temperature.
Results
Figure 38-3 shows the temperature plot. The highest temperature is recorded on a vertex which is farthest from the shell and
the minimum temperature is recorded on a node lying on the shell and is at a farthest distance from the solid. The
temperature is unlikely to change even if we change the DQNEAR  value to 3m, as the contact set will remain unchanged.
Any further reduction will lead to increase in maximum temperature and decrease in minimum temperature. Since the
minimum distance between the two bodies is approximately 1.4, hence the solution won’t converge if the DQNEAR  values
are set below the minimum distance. Figure 38-4 shows the heat flux plot. Table 38-1 confirms these findings.

Modeling Tips
The users are encouraged to try out the simulation with different values of DQNEAR .
In addition, these entire scenarios can be simulated in a single run by using multiple subcases concept in SOL 400. By
definition, each subcase is completely independent of other subcase. Thus, we can have multiple BCTABLE  in a single run,
and each subcase will then point to the specific BCTABLE .Table 38-1  Variation of Minimum and Maximum Values of Temperature and Heat Flux with DQNEAR Values

were defined then nonlinear PSHLN2 :

The material properties were modeled by using MATBV  entry as given below:

As Nastran applies gravity over the entire model by default, two material cards were defined. The material without density
was used for solid stiffener modeled with CQUADX so that the gravity load does not get applied on it.&lt;/p&gt;

Transformations and MPCs
T o ensure the compatibility of rotational degrees of freedom between axisymmetric solid and shell elements, MPCs were
used. For the convenience of defining MPCs, transformations using local coordinate systems ( CORD2R ) were defined for the
node at the junction between axisymmetric shell and axisymmetric solid elements,

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then MPCs were defined between the node at the junction and the other nodes at the interface as given below:

Loads and Boundary Conditions
For CAXISYM and CQUADX elements, the axis conventions for axisymmetry are: Y-axis is the axis of symmetry and X-
axis defines the radial direction. The symmetry boundary conditions ( SPC) of the axisymmetric problem was defined
constraining the axial degree of freedom  of the node which lies on the axis of symmetry.
SPC            1     830       2     0.0
Gravity load ( GRAV) was applied on the axisymmetric shell elements as given below:
GRAV           3              1.     0.0   -9.81     0.0     &lt;br&gt;
Pressure loading ( PLOADX1 ) was applied at the bottom face of the solid stiffener. Pressure value was multiplied by  as per
the Nastran convention for the application of the pressure edge load on the axisymmetric problem.

The f06 file generated out of the analysis was studied carefully and the STRESS-XY for the
axisymmetric shell element CAXISYM 1123 were noted as
Shear Stress-(sig-xy) for element CAXISYM 1123 is -1.577151E+04
The grid point force balance for the interface element CAXISYM 1123 is as given below,:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the bending moment/circumference at the interface i:
= 3475.662&lt;em&gt;2&lt;/em&gt;π&lt;em&gt;r
= 3475.662&lt;/em&gt;2&lt;em&gt;3.14159&lt;/em&gt;15
= 36.878 N.m/m
In order to calculate the maximum bending moment and its location, we need to find the maximum bending stress and its
location. Now in order to calculate the bending stress one must know the stress distribution for the shell element. The f06
file reports the stresses for upper layer and lower layer (i.e., LAYER I and LAYER 2) for the CAXISYM elements. For
example, the bending stress for the CAXISYM element 1123 is calculated as given below:
The bending stress can also be calculated asInterface shear force/circumference length = sig-xy * shell thickness
Interface shear force/ circumference length = -1.577151E+04 * 0.06
= 946.3 KN/m
Bending stress = [Total stress (LAYER 1) – Total stress (LAYER 5)]/2&lt;/p&gt;

The bending stress values for all CAXISYM elements are calculated like this and the node where the max. bending stress
occurs was noted. At that particular node, the bending moment would be maximum. Figure 39-5 shows the variation of
bending moment/thickness (N.m/m) with meridional angle.
Figure 39-5  Bending Moment vs. Meridional Angle
The maximum bending moment of 255.126 N.m/m occurs at the meridional angle of 38.15° as shown in Figure 39-5.

Introduction
This release of MSC Nastran incorporates enhanced capabilities of beams and shells with offsets. The offset option had
been included in earlier versions of MSC Nastran, which allows elements being offset from the external grid points to
element connection points, with some limitations. This version eliminates the limitations of some characteristics not being
accounted for in case of offset, viz. differential stiffness (for buckling analysis); effects of thermal, pressure and gravity loads;
mass matrix computation; etc. The aim of this chapter is to demonstrate the various features available in MSC Nastran
regarding in-built beam/shell offsets, which can be employed to analyze beam/shell structures.
The problem presented here is a stiffened plate with reinforcements, fixed at one end and subjected to uniform pressure
load. In analyzing such cases, it is common to model the beams and shells at a geometric location that is different from the
actual physical location. Such cases are common when shells or beams of varying thicknesses are adjacent to each other and
the top/bottom shell surfaces or beam flanges are to be aligned with each other. In such cases, it is convenient to model all
the shell nodes at the mid-surface of one of the shells or the beam nodes at the neutral axis of one of the beams. The
alignment of the top shell surfaces or beam flanges is then achieved by providing a suitable shell or beam offset to the
elements. Another common instance is when beams are used as stiffeners for shells. It is most convenient to model the beam
elements at the mid-surface of the shell and sharing the shell nodal connectivity. The fact that the beam is actually offset
by sum of half the plate thickness and half the height of the beam section is achieved by providing a suitable beam offset.
This demonstration problem is analyzed using two methods - one using the offset option and the other using the
conventional RBE2 approach.
The RBE2 approach is only used to compare the accuracy of the solution obtained using in-built beam/shell offsets and
the emphasis in this chapter is placed on describing the setup and solution using the actual in-built beam/shell offset
capabilities of MSC Nastran.
Solution Requirements
An overhanging flat plate structure that is reinforced by beams is subjected to a top face load. The plate structure has a
variable thickness along the length and the top surfaces of the thick and thin sections are aligned at the same level. The top
portion of the reinforcement beam cross-sections are welded to the bottom surface of the thicker plate. In the geometric
model (corresponding to Case-1), all the elements are modeled at the mid-surface of the thicker plate. Suitable beam/shell
offsets need to be provided to account for the difference between the geometric model and the physical model.
The finite element mesh of the beam-plate structure is shown in Figure 40-1 and Figure 40-2. The geometric model where
the beams are at the shell mid-surface and in-built beam/shell offsets are used is shown in Figure 40-1. The physical model
with the beams and shells at their actual offset locations is displayed in Figures 40-1 and 40-2. This model can be used with
RBE2 links set up between the offset beams and the shell.Case-1: The first method is to use the in-built beam/shell offset capability.
Case-2: The second method is to place the beams and shells at the actual offset position and then tie the nodes of these
elements back to the original position through manually defined RBE2 links. While this method is quite
accurate, it is quite cumbersome for large models. Furthermore, if the offset elements have to contact other
bodies, it is not possible since all degrees of freedom of the offset element nodes are already tied through the
RBE2 links.&lt;/p&gt;

The plate is of length 6000 mm and width 4000 mm. The plate has a variable thickness along the length (70 mm over the
first 4000 mm and 35 mm over the remaining 2000 mm). The top surfaces of the thick and thin shells are aligned at the
same level. One reinforcement beam with a cross-sectional radius (mean) of 100 mm and thickness of 25 mm is placed
across the plate at the point where the plate thickness transition occurs. T wo other reinforcement beams, each with a cross-
sectional radius of 125 mm and thickness of 40 mm, are placed along the length on either side of the plate. The top portion
of the beam cross-sections are welded to the bottom surface of the plate.
Element Modeling
Case-1: The plate of both the cross sections are modeled with lower order shell element ( CQUAD4 ) and for the beam
reinforcements, lower-order beam elements ( CBEAM ) are used. The offset values are specified in the corresponding field of
the CQUAD4  entry. The non-linear extensions are activated by using the PSHLN1  property option in conjunction with the
regular PSHELL  property option in the manner shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

The offset formulation is invoked with MDLPRM , OFFDEF , and LROFF  in the bulk data section. This ensures that the shell
normal directions are used to define the offset direction at each shell grid point and that the effects of offset like differential
stiffness, loadings aspects of offset are taken into account.

The SOL400 nonlinear procedure is employed for both the cases, the parameters of which are defined through the

The NLSTEP  keyword is followed by the identification number entry and by the total time of the analysis which is 1.0 in
this case.
The second line gives the general stepping parameters associated with the analysis. The maximum number of iteration
(=25), maximum number of iteration needed for each increment (=1) and the maximum number of bisections allowed in
current step (=10).
The keyword ADAPT  defines the adaptive time (load) stepping procedure which is followed by the parameters viz. initial
time step, minimum time-step as a fraction of total time, maximum time step, number of desired iterations per increment,
factor for increasing the time step, output flag, etc.
The keyword MECH  stands for a mechanical analysis appended with the parameters such as flags for convergence criteria
selection followed by the error tolerance for displacement, load, and work, respectively. UP stands for convergence criteria
checking with respect to displacement, load and work. The PFNT  character parameter stands for “Pure Full Newton
Raphson” which is the method for controlling stiffness updates.

The key aspect in this analysis is the offsets of beams and shells which can be invoked using the appropriate offset
parameters in the CBEAM  and CQUAD4  bulk data entries.
It is to be noted that MSC Nastran follows numerous element defaults options (please refer to NLMOPTS , SPROPMAP&lt;br&gt;
entries in MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide ). In particular to this analysis, if PSHLN1  option or PBEMN1  options are not
specified in the input, MSC Nastran assumes these options as the MATEP  option is specified in the material properties for
these elements.

Introduction
A key feature of the table-driven growth/shrink of rigid bodies functionality is that the rigid body could be made to change
its shape in addition to translation and rotation (transformation). The evolution of growth/shrink can be controlled by
table driven input with time as independent variable which makes this functionality indispensable for certain kind of
analyses. This feature is illustrated with a typical balloon-expanded stent analysis as an example.
A stent is a small hollow metallic wire mesh which is placed in choked coronary arteries to help keep them distended to
ensure sufficient flow of blood. A stent, the key element of such a treatment – called angioplasty – is inserted and placed
into the artery in crimped state by means of a catheter and are deployed by means of balloon. The deployment is done by
expanding the balloon such that the stent undergoes plastic deformation to dilate the clogged artery and holds it from
constricting.
This problem illustrates the deployment and recoil (spring back) steps of the stent analysis. The deformation of balloon is
ignored and is replaced by a rigid growing/shrinking cylinder. In the deployment step, the cylinder is expanded such that
the radius grows three times its original size. And in the recoil step, the cylinder is shrunk to 1.5 times of its original size.
Solution Requirements
A simple stent of internal radius of 0.92 mm with wire thickness 0.08 mm and length 6.96 mm is modeled and meshed
with 8 node brick elements. The mesh contains 1014 brick elements, 4 spring elements and 4913 nodes. A rigid cylindrical
surface of 1.0 mm internal radius and 7.0 mm long is modeled which simulates the balloon.
The finite element mesh of the beam-plate structure with the rigid cylinder is shown in Figure 41-1.

It is to be noted that the stent nodes enters and leaves contact often during this contact intensive analysis. The specification
of the distance tolerance and the bias factor can largely influence the duration of analysis. Moreover, during the shrink
operation it can be noticed that the stent is relatively free to move and is restrained only by the soft springs provided for
arresting rigid body motion. This does not affect the real scenario where is stent normally clings on to the blood vessel.&lt;/p&gt;

Summary
Introduction
Bolt modeling is important in analyses of engine assemblies. Gasket joints, which are used in such assemblies to prevent
steam or gas from escaping, are often fastened by a number of bolts. In a typical loading sequence of an engine assembly,
the bolts are first fastened until a certain pre-tension force is present in the bolts. This can be achieved by shortening the Title Chapter 42: Automated Bolt Modeling

bolts until the desired force is reached. Next, the bolts are “locked”, that is, the amount of shortening remains fixed, while
the assembly is subject to other (thermo-) mechanical loads. Finally, the bolts are loosened again, either by decreasing the
shortening or by releasing the bolt forces.
FEM Modeling
The geometry of the model, shown in Figure 42-1, is a structure having two flanges connected through two bolts. The
materials of bolts and the flanges are different. The left end of the left side flange is clamped and force of 3000 lbf is applied
via RBE2 element. In order to apply pre-tensioning on the bolts, automatic bolt creation and assisted bolt creation option
is used for Bolt-1 and Bolt-2 respectively, where the pre-tension force (2000 lbf) has been applied at each bolt location via
control nodes.

Bolt Modeling
In various engineering applications, it is necessary to define a pre-stress in, for example, bolt or rivets before applying any
other structural loading. A convenient way do this is via the BOLT entry. The key idea is to split the element mesh of the
bolt across the shank in two disjoint parts, such that duplicate grid points appear at the cut, and to create an overlap or gap
between the two parts via multi-point constraints, which is done internally using the BOLT  entry. If the motion of these
parts is somehow constrained in the direction in which the gap or overlap is created, then an overlap (shortening) will
introduce a tensile stress in each of the parts and a gap (elongation) will result in a compressive stress.
In this exercise, one coordinated systems (LCS4) is created automatically when automatic bolt creation option is used for
Bolt-1 and other local coordinated systems is created manually (LCS6) using 3 points when assisted bolt creation option
is used for Bolt-2.The local C/S is described through CORD2R  entry.

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BOLT entry is described below:
New bulk data entry creates MPCs internally to all six degrees of freedom
(GTi,GBi) are pairs of (usually are coincident) grids on top and bottom
Same number of grid points should be in TOP and BOTTOM
GRIDC is the control grid point (usually not connected to any element)
Bolt loads prescribed on GRIDC
Global Coordinate System has to be defined at the Control Node if the bolt direction is not a Basic Coordinate
direction
Loads in directions other than the bolt direction are possible
The BOLT  force can be output by MPCFORCE  request output at each Control Node ( GC)
The new bulk data option, BOLT , supports only small rotations in this release. Since it is targeted to analyses of
engine gasket joints, this is not considered a severe limitation
Sufficient boundary conditions must be applied on the control grid to suppress any rigid body modes if the two
parts of the structure are not constrained
In a contact analysis, the amount of shortening is limited to the sum of the sizes of the elements in the direction in
which the shortening is prescribed. If the shortening exceeds this limit, the contact surface patches will start to
overlap each other, leading to problems with sliding.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

&lt;p&gt;Loading and Boundary Conditions
Figure 42-1 shows the loading and boundary conditions applied on the finite element model of the solid structure. Analysis
is done in 5 load steps explained below.
Load step-1 : Pre-tension force of 2000 lbf applied to Bolt-1
Load step-2:  Pre-tension force of 2000 lbf applied to Bolt-2 and locking of the Bolt-1 using the SPC1  entry.
Load step-3:  Locking of the Bolt-1 and Bolt-2 using SPC1  entry.
Load step-4:  Load step-3 + point load of 3000 lbf applied to right face of the right flange via RBE2.
Load step-5:  Remove the point load from load step-4.
SPCADD  and LOAD cards define the single point constraint set and load set respectively. Displacement constraints and
concentrated nodal forces are specified using SPC1 and FORCE  cards, respectively.

The BCTABLE  entries shown below identify the admissible contact combinations, select the secondary a nd primary b ody for
each combination, and set associated parameters. It is important to note that:
The shaft part of the BOLT-1 and BOLT-2 have not been defined as a contact body to avoid the touching
condition between shaft part of the BOLT-1 and BOLT-2 with holes of the left and right flange. If this touching
condition will arises then correct magnitude of bolt pretension force will not be applied on the flanges and we will
not get proper response of the bolt tightening/loosening.
The ISEARCH  entry is set to 0 (Double orders search, Default) the search order is from lower BCBODOY  ID’s to
higher ones first. If no contact is detected, then it searches the opposite order to force search order from the
secondary b ody to the primary.
Both bolts can touch the right flange and the both flanges can touch each other.
The IGLUE  entry is set to 1 for contact between both bolts and left flange to activate glued contact conditions
(that is, no sliding and no separation) between these two contact bodies.

Introduction
This example demonstrates the thermal-mechanical coupling capability and the use of &amp;lsquo;user subroutine&amp;rsquo; feature in MSC
Nastran. It simulates a cylinder upsetting process considering the heat generation due to plastic heating and frictional
effects. The mechanical and heat transfer analysis are handled in a staggered manner. While the mechanical analysis
computes the deformation behavior considering the frictional effects and the plastic heating, the thermal behavior of the
problem is analyzed in the heat transfer analysis. The model is created based on the literature (please see reference [ 1.]) and
the results are compared with the experiments.
FEM Modeling
The model is set up as an axi-symmetric, thermal-mechanical coupled problem. The cylinder is modeled using axi-
symmetric elements and half symmetry is considered in modeling (shown in Figure 43-2). Punch is assumed to be a rigid
body. The model will be analyzed with friction to show the combined effect of heat generation due to plastic deformation
and the friction between punch and workpiece. The conversion factor from plastic work and friction work to the heat
source is 0.9. Some heat loss due to the release of dislocations and due to the lubrication is considered.
Element Modeling
The cylinder is modeled using nonlinear axi-symmetric element. Axi-symmetric elements are selected using CTRIAX  entry
pointing to a PLPLANE  entry which in turn, points to an auxiliary PSHLN2  entry as shown below. PSHLN2  entry specifies
additional nonlinear properties for axi-symmetric elements. By choosing ISH option, implicit structural and heat elements
are referred. Second line of PSHLN2  entry specifies element behavior and integration scheme for structural and heat pass.
By selecting element structural behavior as IAX, an incompressible axi-symmetric element formulation is used.

Modeling Contact
The contact bodies are defined as follows: Cylinder as the deformable body and Punch as the rigid body
The contact boundary conditions are as follows:
1.Friction coefficient between the cylinder and the punch with bilinear shear friction law: 0.65
2.Heat transfer coefficient between cylinder and punch: 4 N/s/mm/K
3.Film coefficient to environment: 0.00295 N/s/mm/K
The BCPARA  entry used in the model is given below. With ID zero, the parameters defined here belongs to all the subcases.
FTYPE  indicates the type of friction model to be used. In this example Bilinear Shear friction is used.
BCPARA        0 FTYPE          7
The definition of the contact bodies consists of the BCBODY  bulk data entry which defines the deformable body including
the body ID, dimensionality, type of body, mechanical and thermal properties for the contact body. While the BSURF&lt;br&gt;
identifies the elements forming a part of the deformable body. The following BCBODY  entries are used.

The above BCONUDS  entry points to primary b ody ID 101 which refers to the punch. This entry invokes the flag for
usage of user subroutine ‘ motion ’ which controls the motion of the punch.
To execute the subroutine, user needs to build Dynamic Link Library (shared objects on Linux) which is loaded by MSC
Nastran executable. To simplify this task, you may specify “UDR=nug_73.f” on the command line using the FORTRAN
file delivered in the demonstration manual.   If SDK is still being used, then specify “UDS=nug_73.f” on the command
line and use the CONNECT line as below. The CONNECT line is NOT required if UDR is used.

Introduction
Large deformation rubber seal problems require an accurate method to model contact and friction. Part of the design often
involves self contact of the material. The segment to segment contact algorithm provides a procedure to model this
behavior, incorporating large sliding with support for friction using the bilinear Coulomb and the bilinear shear friction
models. These models are also available with the node-to-segment contact algorithm. In addition to these two friction
models, the user can directly select the non-symmetric stiffness matrix associated with large sliding friction. This choice of
non-symmetric matrix is not available with node to segment contact. Non-symmetric stiffness matrix capability can
decrease the number of iterations to achieve convergence, but requires more memory and may result in an increase in the
total solution time. This method can use only those solvers which allow non-symmetric matrices.
Solution Requirements
Numerical analysis will be performed to compare contact status between node-to-segment and segment-to-segment.
FEM Modeling
The model shown in Figure 44-1 is a structure having a deformable body and two rigid bodies. Both rigid bodies are glued
to deformable body. Loading on the deformable body has been applied via moving rigid body by activating position
controlled method in moving rigid contact body creation option by 200 mm in -Y direction.Element type 3D-4 noded tetrahedron (CTETRA) elements

In node-to-segment contact simulation, penetrations are observed at many places as shown in Figure 44-3. Whereas in
segment-to-segment contact, no penetrations were observed and the contact results are better and much more accurate
compared to node-to-segment as shown in Figure 44-4. The contact status plots for these two models are given in Figure 44-5
and Figure 44-6.
The contact check results for model with hybrid mesh have been processed in Patran using results from HDF5 file. The
geometry adjustment of the model using initial contact is shown in Figure 44-7. The contact check distance and translation

Introduction
This problem demonstrates the thermal stress analysis using a heat shell element type with multiple degrees of freedom
through the element thickness. This element type can simulate constant, linear or quadratic temperature distribution across
the thickness, which provides a more accurate simulation. It also offers ease of modeling and improves computational speed
by avoiding 3-D brick element modeling on thin shell structure. This Solution 400 capability can be applied on either
coupled thermal-mechanical analysis or separate thermal-mechanical runs. Since thermal and structural analyses may be
performed by different engineering groups with huge models, the coupled thermal-mechanical analysis is often impractical.
In this example, an aluminum cylinder is analyzed with nonlinear steady state analysis followed by a separate stress analysis.
The temperature results are saved in a punch file. In the subsequent structural run, the results are accessed through a
TEMP(LOAD) ( in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide ) Case Control command and a NLMOPTS , (TEMPP)  Bulk Data
entry. This interface processes the bottom and middle temperatures of the multi-dof thermal shell elements to determine
the effect of thermal loading.
Solution Requirements
In an orbital heating environment, a directional heat load causes uneven temperature distribution on the surface of exposed
devices. With the fixed ends of an aluminum cylinder, the temperature gradients may introduce high stress at the ends of
the cylinder, which raise risks of material failures.
Figure 45-1 illustrates the dimension of the model as well as thermal loads and boundary conditions. The cylinder is 1.5 inch
in diameter with a length of 6 inch and a thickness of 0.0625 inch. A directional heat flux simulating solar heat load is
applied in negative X direction to the outer surface of the cylinder with a magnitude of 30 W/in2. Heat is lost from the
exterior surface through radiation to the environment at 20.0 oC with a radiation view factor of 1.0.&lt;/p&gt;

Figure 45-2  Structural boundary conditions
The material is aluminum with a thermal conductivity of 3.96 W/in-oC. The absorptivity and emissivity of the cylinder
surface are 0.8. The Young’s modulus of this linear elastic material is 1.0E7 lb/in2 with a Poisson’s ratio of 0.34. T o compute
thermal stress, we have to specify the thermal expansion coefficient that is equal to 1.3E-5 in/in-oC.
FEM Modeling
The thermal model applies a fix ed time stepping scheme with five increments. One dummy SPOINT with an ID of 3172
is used to define ambient temperature for radiation boundary condition. A THERMAL  (Case)  (PUNCH)  Case Control
command is specified to request punch output of temperatures. The Bulk Data entry NLMOPTS  is applied to define quadratic
temperature distribution across the shell thickness via the keyword TEMPP ,QUAD . Another keyword TEMGO,YES  of
this Bulk Data entry is used to retrieve ou tput for the mapping of top, bottom and middle grids. MSC Nastran also saves
the relationships between the top grids and the internally generated bottom and middle grids in the HRMSP data block
of OP2 and DBALL.

In structural run, a fixed time stepping scheme with ten increments is specified. The thermal load is defined through
TEMPERATURE (Case)  (LOAD) Case Control command with ID=5. This thermal load is the only load applied to the model,
with all six degrees of freedom at both ends of the cylinder constrained. The temperatures are imported by including the
modified punch file created from previous thermal analysis. Highlights of the Nastran input for this mechanical model are

&lt;p&gt;Results
Figure 45-3 displays the temperature results showing the cylinder in thermal equilibrium. Since the heat source is directional
and the radiation boundary condition is uniform in all directions, the maximum temperature (~474 oC) is attained on the
side subject to the light source, while the minimum temperature (~424 oC) occurs in the opposite shadow region. The high
conductivity of the aluminum material helps to equilibrate the temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;

iteration strategy; the default convergence tolerance values (0.01) will be used. The convergence method and tolerances
may be specified explicitly as shown here since they will be discussed later.
The obtained lengths of the contact zones are listed in Table 1-3. The exact length of the  contact zone cannot be determined
due to the discrete character of contact detection  algorithms (nodes are detected to be in contact with an element edge for
2-D, element face for 3-D). It is clear , however, that the numerical solution is in good agreement with the analytical one.
The deformed structure plot (magnification factor 1.0) is shown in  Figure 1-2. A plot of the Hertzian contact solution for
the pressure along the contact surface is obtained with linear and parabolic elements as shown in Figure 1-3 and Figure 1-4.Table 1-2  Nonlinear Control Parameters

Figure 1-4  Comparison of Analytical and Numerical Solutions  for Parabolic Elements without Friction
The contact pressure plotted for the contacting nodes shows, even with  this mesh density, an oscillating type of behavior.
This is reduced for the parabolic elements. Generating the same  plots along the contacted nodes produces a smoother curve.
Numerical solutions have also been obtained with a friction  coefficient of 0.1 (bilinear Coulomb). The contact normal and&lt;br&gt;
tangential stress along the contacting nodes are shown in Figure 1-5.
All stresses show an oscillating type of behavior. This can be improved by  refining the mesh in the contact zone.012345678010002000300040005000SOL 400 Contacted SurfaceSOL 400 Contacting SurfaceAnalytical

About Convergence
Although the nonlinearity of the force-displacement relation in this problem is quite mild, looking more closely at the
convergence of this problem will be useful for subsequent problems in this manual, and worthy of mention here as a matter
of introduction. Table 1-4 controls the number of iterations in the Newton-Raphson process illustrated below in
Figure 1-6.

Figure 1-6  Newton - Raphson Path for Load-Displacement Curve
At the beginning of the analysis (Point A in Figure 1-6), the tangent modulus (slope of load-displacement curve) is used to
project to the applied load to Point B, which does not satisfy the convergence criteria. Then equilibrium is re-established
at Point C, and a new slope is computed. The Newton-Raphson iterative procedure continues until the convergence
tolerances are satisfied, Point D. The convergence criteria are based upon displacement, load or work either individually or
in some combination. The Newton-Raphson iterative scheme is recommended for all SOL 400 analyses because the degree
of nonlinearity is typically significant. For the parameters in Table 1-3, the output ( Table 1-4) shows the following
convergence characteristics. The percent sign helps to locate the line in the output file. In this case, the criteria used is both
the displacement, U, and load, P - specified through the UP keyword for the convergence type on the NLSTEP  command&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with a value of 0.01 for each. This means that both relative displacement and load measures (error factors) must be below
0.01 for convergence to be permitted. This can be seen in Figure 1-7.
In this case, there is no checking on the work, even though it has a low tolerance.&lt;/li&gt;

Figure 45-3  Temperature contours
The displacement and von Mises stress results from the subsequent mechanical analysis are shown in Figure 45-4 and
Figure 45-5. Because both sides of the aluminum cylinder are clamped, the largest deformation occurs on the side where
solar heat source is applied. For von Mises stress, peak stresses occurs near the fixed ends as expected. Thermal expansion
causes growth in the axial and radial directions with a circumferential variation due to the directional nature of the thermal
load. Apart from the ends of the cylinder, higher stresses are attained at the location subject to the directional heat load.
The stress is lower in the shadow region located on the opposite side of the cylinder.

Modeling Tips
In multiple physics of 3-D heat shell elements, both thermal and mechanical models must have a consistent type of
temperature distribution. Either quadratic or linear temperature distribution should be specified for both physics. For
sequential thermal-mechanical analysis, the temperatures of the dummy thermal grids or points must be removed from the
temperature load set in mechanical models. These TEMP  (p.640) entries are used to define temperature boundary
conditions in thermal analysis. The dummy thermal grids or points do not exist during structural analysis. For each
mechanical model, only one set of TEMP(LOAD) (p.640) is allowed to apply the temperature results of multi-dof thermal
shell elements to thermal loads. The shell element types supported include CQUAD4 , CQUADR , CQUAD8 , CTRIA3 , CTRIAR  and
CTRIA6  with 3 nodes, which are associated with PSHELL  property entries. The program switches these shell elements to
advanced elements automatically by generating  PSHLN1  entries internally if the original model does not have any PSHLN1  or
PSHLN2  entries .

Summary
Introduction
This chapter demonstrates the usage of the command line keywords udr, uds, udrpath  and udrsave  to build a User
Defined Routine at Nastran job submittal time.  T o build and run a job with either UDR or UDS, you need to provide
source files.  If you are using UDS you will also need to give a service name and a CONNECT SERVICE line in the input
file (The entry is NOT required if UDR is being used). Nastran will build the files needed from the source file and set
environment variables for you in the Nastran job run.
Solution Requirements
If using UDS, then the MSC Software Development Kit (SDK) is required. SDK is NOT required if UDR is being used.
If SDK is being used, then the T ools directory in the SDK installation location must be added in the PATH environment Title Chapter 46: User Defined Service Ease of Use

variable. Otherwise, the building tools will not be found, and error messages will be given in the UDS building procedure.
Note that SDK will be deprecated in the future and users are encouraged to use UDR.&lt;br&gt;
You can implement multiple different interfaces in the source file, all these interface implementations will be built into one
user service. If there are multiple connect service statements in the input file, only the first one will be used to build user
services. It is required that you put all source code in one source file, only the specified source file will participate in user
service building.

Input and User Source File Example
The following shows a Nastran input file and user source file that implements the usr_materials dynamically linked library
(DLL) or shared object (SO) if UDR is specified or SCAIMDSolverUfail SCA service interface if UDS is specified. The
EXT_UFAIL is the predefined FORTRAN subroutine name for both interfaces. The build procedure will appropriately
attach the correctly created files. (UDS will also require a CONNECT line in the input file). For more information about
interfaces and predefined user subroutine names, please refer to the User Defined Service document.
UDR evaluates the name of the FORTRAN file to determine the name of the SO/DLL. UDS uses the CONNECT line
in the input file below. That line is not needed and should not be there if UDR is used. If UDS is used, then the user service
name will be obtained from this statement to create user service and component. In the example, the connected service is
called uds.ufail. The build user service name will be uds.fail and the component name will be ufail located under a directory
called uds.

Command Line Keywords Usage
Like other command line keywords, the UDR/UDRPATH and UDS/UDSSAVE options can be used when running
Nastran jobs.
UDR will compile/link with scripts (see MSC Nastran Installation and Operations Guide )
UDS will compile/link with SCons (Requiring SDK, soon to be deprecated)
The udr/uds keywords are used to specify the source file to build a user defined routine.  The source file must have the
implementation of one or more interfaces and all related subroutines.  The use the udr/uds keywords for the example input
and source file, run Nastran as the following.  Nastran will build the User Defined Routine first and set the environment
to use the resulting binary.  If udrpath/udrsave is not given, the files will be built and referenced in the output directory
and removed after the job. For example,
nastran nufail.dat udr=ext_ufail.F
or
nastran nufail.dat uds=ext_ufail.F
An alternative way to specify the source file is to put source code in the BULK UDR/UDS section in the input file, then
specify UDR/UDS=model on the command line.  Nastran will extract the source code and create a source file first to build
the binaries. The format of the BULK UDR/UDS section is as follows.
Input file nufail.dat :
BEGIN BULK&lt;br&gt;
…
BEGIN BULK UD R=material
subroutine  ext_ufail(&amp;hellip;)
implicit none
&amp;hellip;
end
ENDDATA
For UDS:
BEGIN BULK&lt;br&gt;
…
BEGIN BULK UDS=material
subroutine  ext_ufail(&amp;hellip;)
implicit none
&amp;hellip;
end
ENDDATA
Run Nastran with UDR/UDS source code in BULK UDR/UDS section of your input file:
nastran nufail.dat ud r=model
nastran nufail.dat uds=model
udrpath - path of the DLL&amp;rsquo;s created with udr=
udsave - path used for files created by SCons/SDK&lt;/p&gt;

Main Index
The udrpath/udrsave command line options are used to specify the UDR/UDS build location. If these keywords are give,
the user components will be built at the specified location and not be removed after the job run.   This procedure will allow
the user to reuse the object files (.SO/.DLL) without being built again. For uses convenient, a file named udspath will be
created to set environment variables if UDS is used. Users can run with these options. For example,
For UDR
nastran nufail.dat udr=ext_ufail.F udrpath=/scratch/mydir
nastran nufail.dat                 udroath=/scratch/mydir
For UDS

Introduction
It is known that pre-load may have a significant effect on the Eigen-frequency of a structure. This capability has been
available in the previous releases of the SOL 400 sequence of MSC Nastran. But for elements with extended properties like
plane stress, plain strain, axi-symmetric solid, solid shell, composite brick elements, etc., the modal stress and strain output
are still missing or are not properly calculated. This has been fixed in the current version of MSC Nastran.Title Chapter 47: Modal Analysis after Pre-load : Modal Analysis after Pre-load

Solution Requirements612
Main Index
Solution Requirements
The solution has to be defined in the so-called perturbation analysis. A sub-case has to be defined which consists of two
steps. The first step is the pre-load one with geometric nonlinear flag activated (PARAM, LGDISP , 1) and the second step
has to be MODES.
FEM Modeling
The numerical solution has been obtained with MSC Nastran&amp;rsquo;s solution sequence SOL 400. The details of finite element
models, material, load, boundary conditions, and solution procedure are discussed next.
Finite Element Models
A cantilever plate is modeled using composite brick elements.
The bulk data file entry defining the composite brick properties of the CHEXA elements is on the PCOMPLS  as  follows:

4       1      .2       0.
5       1      .2       0.
Material
Each layer of the laminated composite material consists of an elastic isotropic material.
Loading and Boundary Conditions
The nodes on the left end side are fixed. The y-z displacements of the nodes on the right end side are fixed. A normal force
is applied on the right end side.

Introduction
This is an example of how Digimat to Nastran interface, both for Nastran SOL400 and SOL700 can be used. This example
illustrates the effect of glass fiber orientation predicted by injection codes to model anisotropy of the material.
Solution Requirements
An anisotropic anlaysis is performed on a simple dumbbell taking into account glass fiber orientation inside plastics matrix
using Nastran SOL400 and Nastran SOL700. T wo Digimat solutions are presented:
1.Digimat Micro solution method:&lt;br&gt;
In this method, Digimat interactively computes material properties (stiffness, macroscopic stress, stresses and
strains in plastics and glass fibers…) using homogenization process and communicates with Nastran at each
iteration of the overall computation. This method allows the user to have access in post processing to per phase
results.
2.Digimat hybrid solution method:
In this method, Digimat uses weak multi-scale coupling techniques for material properties. For the hybrid
solution, Digimat pre-computes macroscopic material properties which are then used in the Digimat-CAE
interface in order to communicate with Nastran at each iteration of the overall computation. This method
allows decreasing the CPU time significantly with respect to Digimat Micro solution but does not allow access
to per-phase results.

Input Mesh and loading
Solid mesh is composed of 2050 hexahedral elements and is presented in Figure 48-1. Shell mesh is composed of 760
quadrilateral element decomposed in 20 layers (see Figure 48-2). The left part of the mesh is clamped, while a 2.5mm
displacement along X-axis of the right part is imposed.&lt;/p&gt;

Digimat material description
The material is modeled using Digimat Software and is composed of a plastics phase and a glass fibers phase. The
orientation of the glass fibers is predicted by Moldflow3D and is presented in Figure 48-3. The fibers are aligned in the
loading direction at skin elements, while the fiber orientation is transverse along Y-axis in the center of the dumbbell. It is
important to notice that the fiber orientation change from one element to the other. So, modeling such structure with
isotropic material or classical anisotropic material does not make sense.&lt;/p&gt;

In Figure 48-14, Figure 48-17, and Figure 48-18, the achieved potential of maximum stiffness (APS) is presented. APS gives the
fraction of the maximum stiffness which is effectively achieved for a given loading and a given orientation. It is computed,
on a given integration point i, as the ratio between the actual equivalent stiffness and the equivalent stiffness for a
unidirectional (UD) loaded in the fiber direction. This value is strongly dependent of the material properties.

Summary
Introduction
This example shows the buckling analysis using axisymmetrical shell elements. The structure to be analysed is a
hemispherical dome loaded by external pressure. The external pressure loads are first converted into accurate equivalent
grid forces which are eventually used as the applied load in the FEM model. It is assumed that the buckling mode shape is
also axisymmetrical.
Solution  Requirements
The buckling solution in SOL 400 needs two subcases. The first subcase is a linear static analysis. The second subcase is
the eigenmode analysis where the initial stresses for building the geometric stiffness matrices are coming from the first
subcase (this is done by using STATSUB  (Case) ).Title Chapter 49: Buckling of Hemispherical Dome

Modeling Tips
The coordinate of the grid should be accurate enough to match the hemispherical geometry. This can be very important
when user refines the mesh by subdividing the existing element. The refinement has to be done starting from the geometry.
PLOADX1 is not accurate enough to convert the distributed load into grid force when the element does not have constant
radial coordinate, like hemispherical shell. Therefore to have accurate results, users should convert it to the equivalent grid
force and then apply it into the model.

SOL 400 is used for the FE analysis of this problem. The advanced HEX element defined by PSOLID  entry with an auxiliary
PSLDN1  entry is used. Due to the nonlinearity introduced by nonlinear material properties and contact, convergence
speed varies with the nonlinear deformation and changes of contact condition. In order to achieve fast and stable analysis,
the time step size is automatically adjusted according to the convergence condition. NLSTEP  is used to control the time
step in the current version of MSC Nastran SOL 400.

For small strain behaviour a neo-Hookean material would give behaviour similar to an incompressible elastic material with
shear modulus (G) = 2 C10 =2000 for this case. The data is entered as follows.
The first plate is an elastic-plastic material defined by the Young&amp;rsquo;s modulus, shear modulus, yield stress and work hardening
data. The von Mises yield surface with isotropic hardening is chosen. The additive decomposition of the strain increment
is used.
The elastic properties are:
E=3.e7 psi
G=1.5e7 psi
 = 0.0
The yield stress and the work hardening data is defined through the TABLES1  that is referenced by the MATEP  option shown
below.
Material ID 3 is associated with plate 2 and is considered to be a simplified elastic-plastic material. It is often used when
the tensile and compressive behaviour is different. The elastic data is given on the MATBV  option, but traditional Young&amp;rsquo;s MATHE 8 MOONEY

file. If the UDR command line option is used instead of UDS, then the connect line is not needed in the input file.    If
using UDS, in this model, it is defined as follows:
CONNECT SERVICE elasplas &amp;lsquo;mytest111&amp;rsquo;
The name elasplas is referred by MATUDS, and elasplas is service name used in SCA system.
MSC Nastran provides two methods to implement User Defined Service:
1.The user defined service are saved independently. All the related subroutines are required to be put into one source
file, for example, mysource.F:
subroutine ext_umat(&amp;hellip;)
implicit none
&amp;hellip;
end
subroutine ext_notify(&amp;hellip;)
implicit none
&amp;hellip;
end
Command to execute this user defined service is
With UDR:
nastran test.dat udr=mysource.F
With UDS:
nastran test.dat uds=mysource.F
2.The user defined subroutines are placed in Nastran Input file. There is the BEGIN BULK UDR or BEGIN BULK
UDS s ection in input file for user subroutine implementations. The content of this section will be used to create
the source file when building user service. For example,
BEGIN BULK
…
BEGIN BULK UDR=elasplas       $ or BEGIN BULK UDS=elaspla .. if using UDS
subroutine ext_umat(&amp;hellip;)
implicit none
&amp;hellip;MATUSR 7 1 23
MATUDS 7 MATUSR Elasplas UMAT
INT 1 1
REAL 2.0e7 0.3 0.5e6 1.0d20
CHAR STEEL&lt;/p&gt;

end
subroutine ext_notify(&amp;hellip;)
implicit none
&amp;hellip;
End
ENDDATA
T o build use service from subroutines in BEGIN BULK UDS  section in an input file, the uds keyword should be set to
model  in MSC Nastran run.
nastran test.dat uds=model
User may use the user state variables in the user-defined service, i.e., user subroutine. The first user state variable is always
the temperature. User can&amp;rsquo;t change it or store other variable in the first state variable. The default name of the user state
variables are entitled as SV1,  SV2, … and so on. User may define the name of the user state variables according to their
physics. An example used in this example is given as follows:
User may specify the output of the user state variable by selecting their default name and assigned name in NLOUT  which is
sited in NLSTRESS (Case) in Case Control Section.
Contact Parameters
As shown in Figure 50-1, each contact pairs consists of one cube (stopper) and one plate. There are a total four pairs of
contact bodies. In the input data file, the contact bodies are defined deformable contact bodies using BCBODY1  and
BSURF , taking Plate 1 and Cube 1 as example, as below:UDSESV 7 4 23

In the FE model as shown in Figure 50-1, both plates and cubes are using 3D 8-nodes brick elements.  The solution was
obtained by using the MSC Nastran SOL 400 with the advanced HEX ( CHEXA ) element, which is defined by the PSOLID and
PSLDN1 bulk data options as shown below, where  (C8 SOLI L) defines the 3-D continuum solid element with linear

Time Step Control
As mentioned before, the adaptive time step control NLSTEP is used in this simulation. Its BULK DATA ENTRY  card is :
NLSTEP  defines the parameters to control the time step and convergence schemes. In this example, ADAPT  refers to
adaptive time step adjustment, i.e., the code will automatically adjust the time step according to convergence situation of
the job running. The three values following after ADAPT  are the initial time step factor, minimal allowable time step factor
and the maximal allowable time factor, respectively. The desired number of iterations ( the 4th field after ADAPT ) is set $ Define BCTABLE1

as 5. T o set a proper desired number of iterations is critical to achieve the solution with minimum computation time and
adequate accuracy. T oo large numbers may cause significant change of time step size between increments, which may cause
the solution to converge slowly or even diverging. If this happens, SOL 400 cuts the time step size back. As one of the
consequences, the analysis may need even longer computation time. To avoid this, it is recommended to set a reasonably
small value for the maximum ratio of incremental step size change between incremental steps (the 5th field after ADAPT ).
This parameter is set as 1.2 with desired number of iterations as 5. This is particularly important in order to avoid
penetration and also to control the time step size with good balance of efficiency and accuracy. PFNT  means that full
Newton-Raphson method is adopted. The maximum iteration for each increment is set to 100. UPV  means the
convergence scheme is set to check both the convergence of displacements and residuals, based on the components of both
displacement and residual vectors. Here, both tolerances are set as 0.01.
Case Control Parameters
There is one loading step in the analysis. Load STEP (Case) ID 1 of SUBCASE (Case) ID 1 defines all necessary conditions applied
to the analysis for this load step which includes bulk data options ( TITLE (Case) , NLSTEP  NLSTEP (Case) , BCONTACT (Case) , SPC
(Case) , LOAD (Case) and the requested output information. Particularly, it is necessary to note the analysis control options of
NLMOPTS and the LGDISP parameter. In this example, the NLMOPTS  option defines LRGS  to 1. It means that LARGE STRAIN&lt;br&gt;
formulation is used. The LGDISP parameter indicates that geometric nonlinearity includes the stiffness of follower forces.
NLSTEP  NLSTEP (Case) refers to its Bulk Data Entry and defines the parameters to control the time step and convergence
schemes. The corresponding input is given as follows.

on the deformed geometry. Figure 50-3 depicts the distribution of von Mises Stress on the deformed geometry. It may be
seen that the von Mises stress of Plate 1 is much smaller than ones of other plates, it is due to the stress level in Plate 1&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction
Industrial brackets have stiff spacers, vibration-isolating pads between the bracket and other components. In most cases,
these stiff components need not be modelled in detail and their representation can be modelled using Initial Gap option
(GAP between the bodies to be moved). The initial gap/clearance option can be used to
Define a gap or overlap between contact bodies.
Move the nodes of the contact surfaces so that they are precisely in contact.
Eliminate small gaps or penetrations caused by numerical round off (in Pre-processor) and prevent possible
convergence problems.
Unlike stress free option, the nodes of contact bodies will not be moved when initial gap capability is used. Element type 2D Shell and 3 D Solid Elements

In MSC Nastran, the initial gap capability is modelled with BCONPRG card using MGINGP keyword. It defines the value
that needs to be moved between two contact bodies.
Figure 52-1  Bracket and Base modelled with Initial gap, the edges of the base model is fixed in all directions.
Using BCONPRG card and MGINGP keyword in MSC Nastran, we can now specify initial gap value at the start of a
simulation.

FEM Solutions
A numerical solution has been obtained with MSC Nastran&amp;rsquo;s solution sequence - SOL 400 for the finite element mesh
shown in Figure 52-1.
In this problem, there is a geometric gap of 2.5 mm between the Bracket (BCBODY 2) and Base (BCBODY 3) in the FEA
model. Four options are tried, without using Initial Gap/clearance feature, using Initial gap/clearance of 0.0 mm, using
Initial gap/clearance of 1.0 mm and with Initial gap/overlap of -1.0 mm.
In option 3, to reduce the gap between Bracket and Base part to 1.5 mm (from 2.5 mm in actual FEA model),
Touching/ Secondary b ody (BCBODY 2) is moved by 1.0 mm by using Initial gap feature.
The elements in the entire part have been selected as contact bodies with the BCBODY and BSURF entries.
Contact Parameters
Contact body IDs 2 and 3 are identified as a set of elements of body 2 and 3 using BCBODY1 card.
The Initial gap/clearance option is set up using BCONPRG as follows&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Demonstration Problems
FEM Solutions666
Main Index
The Initial gap/clearance option can only be used at the start of the simulation, with Initial contact (BCTABL1, 0).It means
that a separate BCONPRG card is required to define Initial gap. In this case BCONPRG, 1 is used to define gap in initial
contact (with gap cards in second line) and BCONPRG, 2 card to define general contact properties.
Search tolerance of initial gap or overlap is defined using TOLINGP keyword and Primary c ontact surface is used to drive
using CDINGP = 1 keyword. MGINGP keyword is used to define the Gap (if &amp;gt; 0 Gap) and overlap (if &amp;lt; 0 Overlap)
magnitude.
Material/Geometry Parameters
All the three bodies in this analysis are defined as isotropic elastic materials. The Young&amp;rsquo;s modulus, Poisson ratio, and
density are defined using MAT1 card&lt;/p&gt;

It can be observed from Figure 52-5 that the Bracket moves by 1.0 mm and a gap of 1.5 mm is maintained between bracket

Introduction
An interference fit, is a fastening between two parts which is achieved by friction after the parts are pushed together, rather
than by any other means of fastening.
Typical examples of interference fits are the press fitting of shafts into bearings, bearing housings, and pipe fittings.
This example demonstrates the “Interference Fit” analysis between piston pin (semi-floating type) and small end of
connecting rod. T wo cases showcasing two analysis options are analyzed.
1.Interference closure along a user specified direction (using scale factor in cylindrical coordinate system).
2.Automatic computation of interference based on the initial penetration of the secondary n ode.Boundary conditions 1.Displacement-Z fixed on one side of Piston Pin and Connecting Rod, to simulate
symmetry boundary condition.
2.Bottom end of Connecting Rod fixed in All DOF.
3.Pin center node is constrained in X and Y Direction to overcome rigid body motion.
Applied loads Total Interference of 0.5 mm between piston pin and small end of the Connecting Rod.

The pseudo displacement vector are found between the nodes of the overlapping body into the other body. The penetration
tolerance should be a little more than the highest penetration between contact body pair. Nodes within this tolerance are
considered for the interference calculation.
MSC Nastran calculates pseudo displacement vector at each node is by taking the perpendicular distance between the node
and the closest touched segment ( Figure 53-4 (a)).
During the analysis these pseudo displacements will be gradually reduced according to table data (TABLED1 card) and
contact will be established. At the end of analysis pseudo displacement vector will vanish and the interference is resolved
(Figure 53-4 (b)).&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction
Buckling is an important failure mode for thin shell structures subjected to compressive loading. Initial geometric
imperfection can reduce the buckling strength of shell structures significantly. Most of the design codes emphasize the need
for the processes to be followed to account for the geometric imperfection in the buckling design of slender structures. In
the present example, the effect of different shapes and amplitudes of initial geometric imperfection have been studied on
the nonlinear buckling and post buckling analysis of thin cylindrical shell under axial compressive load.
Solution Requirements
Thin cylindrical shell with radius of 350 mm and thickness of 1 mm is subjected to axial compressive load to study its post
buckling behavior for different shape and amplitude of initial geometric imperfection. The buckling modes from linear
buckling analysis is used to define various imperfection shapes. Geometric nonlinear analysis with Crisfield method is used
to evaluate the load carrying capacity and post buckling behavior of cylindrical shell. For this study, the following types of
imperfections are used in the post buckling analysis.
1.Imperfection shapes from modes 1 to 10 of linear buckling (SOL 105) with imperfection amplitude of 0.5 mm.
2.Imperfection shape from mode 4 of linear buckling with its amplitude varying from 0.2 mm to 1.0 mm.
3.Imperfection shape generated from the combination of all 16 modes from linear buckling with imperfection
amplitude of 1.0 mm. In addition to post buckling analysis, another new feature on nonlinear buckling is used to
evaluate nonlinear buckling load and mode shape for this model.
FEM Modeling
FEM solutions have been obtained with MSC Nastran&amp;rsquo;s solution sequence SOL 400 for the 3-D shell representations of
the cylindrical shell. The details of finite element model, imperfection modeling, material, load, boundary conditions, and
solution procedures are discussed.
Finite Element Models
The finite element model used for the cylindrical shell is shown in Figure 61.1. The shell is meshed with 4500 CQUAD4
shell elements with 90 divisions along the circumference and 50 divisions along the axial direction.Element Types 3D Shell (CQUAD4) elements
Imperfection Properties 1.Imperfection shape from mode shapes of linear buckling analysis
2.Different Imperfect shapes from modes 1 to 10
3.Imperfection from combination of multiple modes 1 to 16
4.Maximum Imperfection Amplitude = Shell Thickness = 1.0 mm
FE Results Load-Displacement curves to demonstrate effect of imperfection&lt;/p&gt;

Figure 54-1  Finite Element Mesh for Cylindrical Shell
The element properties of these shell elements are described with the following PSHELL card:
Imperfection Modeling
Imperfection shapes are defined by using buckling mode shapes from SOL105 - linear buckling analysis of cylindrical shell.
The following EIGRL card is used to extract 16 modes from this analysis:
The hdf5 post file &amp;rsquo;nimpf_cyl_s105.h5&amp;rsquo; from this linear buckling analysis is used to define the imperfection shape by using
the following ASSIGN statement in the post buckling analysis:
ASSIGN HDF5IN= &amp;rsquo;nimpf_cyl_s105.h5&amp;rsquo; &amp;rsquo; UNIT=31
The following cards are used in the case control section to define the imperfection and its output for the analysis:
IMPERFECT = 1
OIMPERFECT(PLOT)=ALL
This imperfection ID 1 is used to define IMPCASE card in the bulk data section. To understand the effect of using each
mode of linear buckling to define the imperfection shape with amplitude of 0.5 mm, the following IMPCASE and 10
IMPGEOM cards are used in the bulk data section. The scale factor SCALEi  is used to multiply the Eigen Vector of each
mode to get the imperfection amplitude of 0.5 mm. Nastran will repeat the post buckling analysis for each one of these 10
different imperfection shapes with this definition of IMPCASE and IMPGEOM cards in the same SOL400 run (This is
equivalent to running 10 different SOL400 jobs for a model containing a single IMPGEOM card).

The modes 1 to 10 from linear buckling analysis are used to define imperfection in the model &amp;rsquo;nimpf_cyl_v1.dat&amp;rsquo; with
maximum imperfection amplitude of 0.5 mm in these modes. The peak load at the first limit point of axial load Vs axial

For studying the effect of imperfection amplitude, the imperfection values in the range of 0.2 mm to 1.0 mm for mode 4
is defined in another model nimpf_cyl_v2.dat . The load displacement curves for different imperfection amplitudes
are shown in Figure 54-4. From these plots, it is observed that the imperfection value in the order shell thickness (1.0 mm)
can reduce the maximum load carrying capacity of cylindrical shell under axial compression by 70% and it highlights the
importance of including the effect of initial geometric imperfection in buckling analysis. The post buckling shape of the
cylindrical shell with initial imperfection mode 4 is shown in Figure 54-5.
As the Eigen values for different modes 1 to 16 are almost close in the linear buckling analysis (SOL 105), it is important
to see the effect of mix of these modes for imperfection shape. The effect of mixed modes from all 16 modes are considered
in the model nimpf_cyl_v3.dat . The effect of this mixed mode is also shown in the load-displacement curve of
Figure 54-4. The imperfection shape with mode 4 is found to be less stiff with slightly less limit load compared to the mixed
mode imperfection shape. The post buckling shape of the cylindrical shell with mixed mode of initial imperfection is shown
in Figure 54-6. The punch file nimpf_cyl_v3.pch  generated (with an output request
OIMPERFECT(PLOT,PUNCH)=ALL ) from this model is used to create an external imperfection file
nimpf_cyl_v4.impf , which is used to define imperfection for another model to carryout nonlinear buckling analysis.

Nonlinear buckling analysis is carried out for this model &amp;rsquo;nimpf_cyl_v4.dat&amp;rsquo; by adding the entry NLBUCK=END in case
control section. With this case control entry, Nastran calculates the buckling load factor ALPHA in the last increment.
Alternatively, it is also possible to carry out the nonlinear buckling analysis in each increment by using the entry
NLBUCK=ALL. The axial compressive load of 250000 N is applied in 50 equal increments. The output section with
buckling estimate from the last increment are shown below :
The ALPHA value from nonlinear buckling analysis is used to calculate the buckling load.
Pre-load = 250000 N
Load increment = 250000/50 = 5000 N
ALPHA = 0.2528805
Nonlinear Buc kling Load = 250000 + (5000 × 0.2528805) = 251264.4 N
The buckling mode predicted from this nonlinear buckling analysis of cylindrical shell for the mixed mode of imperfection
shape with the imperfection amplitude of 1.0 mm is shown in Figure 54-7.

The concept of Monitor Points allows users to sum forces over certain regions of aerodynamic or structural mesh about
chosen points in a defined coordinate system. In this example, MONPNT1 and MONPNT3 are specified to output the
monitor data. MONPNT1 enables the extraction of the applied loading for a specified region, while MONPNT3 provides
a summation of the internal loads to facilitate computing resultant forces at a cut in the structure. This integrated load
feature is widely used by aerospace engineers to drive load mapping applications and assess the performances of aircraft.
Although Monitor Points were originally designed for aeroelastic simulations, they can also be applied to any type of
analysis.
Solution Requirements
T o model Monitor Points, the user must specify MONITOR Case Control command as well as MONPNT1 or
MONPNT3 Bulk Data entries.
The MONITOR Case Control command controls the printing of the monitor point results. This command must be
placed above the subcase level or in the first subcase above the step level so that it applies to all subcases and steps.
MONITOR commands are ignored in subcases after the first one or in any steps.
The following two Bulk Data entries are used to define Monitor Points:
MONPNT1 - External integrated loads at a user-specified point.
MONPNT3 - Sum of selected grid point forces for the user-defined set of nodes and elements.
The MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide  provides detailed descriptions of the above command and entries. Users can better
understand the Monitor Points capability by reading the numerous remarks in this guide.
FEM Modelin g
The MONITOR Case Control Command is defined to request monitor point results. Note that a GPFORCE command
is also specified to compare MONPNT3 results and grid point forces output. A partial list of Executive Control statements
and Case Control commands is shown as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

A set of MONPNT3 results for the bottom contact edge with or without contact force exclusion (XFLAG = blank, SMAD,
or SMADC) is shown in the following table.
Since contact force is the only force type applied to node 381, it is seen that only adding the &amp;lsquo;C&amp;rsquo; option in the XFALG of
MONPNT3 can obtain different results for MONPNT3.
Modeling Tips
The existing mini-EMA (element matrix assembly) method implemented for MONPNT3 in linear solution
sequences cannot be applied in nonlinear analysis. Instead, MONPNT3 must post-process grid point force results
to obtain point information.
Since nonlinear MONPNT3 must use grid point force methodology, the accuracy of nonlinear MONPNT3
results depends on the robustness of nonlinear GPFORCE calculations.
Thermal loads are not considered in MONPNT1.
For external superelements, Monitor Points results cannot be retrieved at the assembly run (second step). The
third step must be run to get the Monitor Points results.S T R U C T U R A L   I N T E G R A T E D   F R E E   B O D Y   M O N I T O R   P O I N T   L O A D S (MONPNT3)

Introduction
This example demonstrates the usage of thermal chaining from steady state analysis to transient analysis. While performing
transient analysis, users normally have ideas about the initial thermal loading and temperature boundary conditions.
However, they may not know exactly the temperature distribution at the beginning. As a result, they need to pick the heat
flux loading at the time equal to zero to run a steady-state thermal analysis, and then use the resulting temperatures as the
starting temperatures for the subsequent transient thermal analysis.
If the thermal chaining capability is not available, two separate runs are required to obtain accurate initial temperatures.
First, the temperature results of the steady-state run are saved in a punch file. The program then reads in initial temperatures
from the punch file in the second transient run. The support of sequential steady-state analysis to transient analysis in a
single run resolves the above inconvenience. It provides a more efficient tool for thermal analysis because the analysis
requires less disk space and CPU time.
Solution Requirements
The ANALYSIS Case Control commands with different analysis types are applied to perform the sequential steady state
thermal analysis followed by transient thermal analysis in a single run. The user must specify ANALYSIS=HSTAT in Step
1 and ANALYSIS=HTRAN in Step 2.
For the second transient step, three possible temperature boundary conditions should be modeled as follows.
1.If the temperature boundary conditions are constant and are identical to those in the steady state step, the same
SPC ID can be defined in the Case Control section, which refers to the same SPC Bulk Data entries.Applied loads and
Boundary ConditionsThe initial heat flux of 135.3 W/m2 (steady state thermal loading) is applied on the top
surface of the disc. Heat is lost to space through radiation to ambient with temperature fixed
at absolute zero degrees. In the subsequent transient analysis, the heat flux loading is
changed to a sine function with a maximum power of 1353.0 W/m2.

2.If the temperature boundary conditions are constant but are different from those in the steady state step, a different
SPC ID must be defined in the Case Control section, which refers to a different set of SPC Bulk Data entries.
3.For time-varying temperature boundary conditions, a different SPC ID must be defined in the Case Control
section. In the Bulk Data section, the user must specify SPCD and SPC1 entries along with TLOAD1 and
TABLED1 entries to define the transient boundary conditions.

The solar source is modeled by the non-directional heat flux load (QBDY3) applied on the top surface of the disc. The
initial heat flux is 135.3 W/m2 at the beginning of the transient thermal analysis. This thermal loading is specified in the
first steady-state step to compute the temperature distribution for the initial condition of the subsequent transient step.
Heat is lost to space through the radiation exchange (RADBC) with a view factor of 0.7 to an ambient node with
temperature fixed at absolute zero. Highlights of the radiation boundary conditions and the steady state thermal loading
are shown below.

Figure 56-5  Transient Temperature Results at Time Equal to 750 sec. The Peak Temperature is 38.9 oC
Although the peak solar power is specified at time equal to 500 sec, it takes time for the glass disc to absorb and transfer
thermal energies. As a result, the peak temperature lags more and diminishes across the thickness of the disc.
Modeling Tips
One single subcase is allowed in the model.
IC Case Control command is ignored because the temperature results of the steady-state analysis are served as the
initial temperatures of the subsequent transient analysis.
Multiphysics with SUBSTEP Case Control Command is not supported.

Introduction
This example demonstrates Cuntze-Bold failure and material model (CBFMM). Here we analyze composite plate failure
under impact of projectile with speed and height. This will simulate the failure behavior of unidirectional and woven
composite materials of solid shell structure.
Solution Requirements
The impact analysis solution in SOL 400 needs transient analysis. The subcase is a nonlinear transient analysis with 200
increments of size t=5e-5 and each increment with minimum 2 iteration set as it involves contact job. Here each increment
will output various failure constant and von-misses stress at different time step after impact of projectile and bounce back.
To define contact between projectile and plate we need Body-to-Body contact definition by BSURF , also initial velocity for
projectile at certain height.

Introduction
This example demonstrates the high-performance nonlinear solver (NLPERF) in MSC Nastran. This model features glued
and frictional contact, bolt preloading, and large displacement effects. The performance is compared to the classic SOL
400 solver (CNLS). The results are compared noting differences seen in contact force output and additional items such as
default contact related outputs included in the f06, MUMPS solver messaging in the f04, iteration messages in the itr file,
and use of the convergence GUI monitor.
The focus of this problem is the activation and outputs from the NLPERF based analysis, not the model setup. Prior
chapters cover assembly modeling using contact in SOL 400 and bolt preload analyses in detail.
Solution Requirements
The leaf spring is modeled with node-to-segment contact to form the assembly and is loaded following a typical bolt
preloading, locking, then load application approach. This solution uses a single SOL 400 SUBCASE with three STEPS.
In the first step, the BOLT1 control grids are free with FORCEs applied to generate a preload. In the second step, the Boundary conditions Partially fixed at eyes of the main Leaf (Y, Z, RX, RY)
Select grids along length in XY plane fixed in Z to promote symmetric solution.
Step 1:
•Bolt control nodes free.
•Middle of lower central clamp plate fixed.
Step 2:
•Bolt control nodes fixed in preloaded state.
•Middle of lower central clamp plate fixed.
Step 3:
•Bolt control nodes fixed in preloaded state.
•Middle of lower central clamp plate partially fixed (X, Z, RX, RY, RZ).
Applied loads Step 1: Bolt preload applied to bolt control grids.
Step 2: Bolt preload locked (control grids fixed and load removed).
Step 3: Enforce Motion of +25. mm in Y applied to lower central clamp plate.
Element type Advanced Nonlinear HEXA Elements
Results Additional Debug Messaging (f04, f06)

control grids are fixed while the FORCEs are removed from the control grids. In the third and final step, an upward
enforced displacement (SPCD) of 25 mm is applied to deform the leaf spring.

The high-performance nonlinear solver in SOL 400 (NLPERF) is activated for this model with the NLSSEL (nonlinear
solver selection) option on the NLMOPTS (nonlinear multiple options) bulk data entry. In this model, NLSSEL is
specified in conjunction with ASSM=ASSUMED (assumed strain formulation for the HEXA elements) and
SPROPMAP=2 (activate advanced element formulation). The resulting definition is given by:&lt;br&gt;
NLMOPTS ASSM    ASSUMED
SPROPMAP 2
NLSSEL   NLPERF
NLPERF could have also been invoked using the AUTO option:
NLMOPTS ASSM    ASSUMED
SPROPMAP 2
NLSSEL   AUTO
The classic SOL 400 solver is used when the NLSSEL option is not specified (default) or directly specified as CNLS:
NLMOPTS ASSM    ASSUMED
SPROPMAP 2
NLSSEL   CNLS
With NLPERF activated, in the MSC Nastran 2024.1 release, SOL 400 will issue the following USER INFORMATION
MESSAGE:

Additional Messaging in f04 and f06
When a model is run using the high-performance nonlinear solver, there are a few additional messages seen in the various
MSC Nastran output files.
If the model input data is found to be unsupported by NLPERF , a FATAL (when NLMOPTS, NLSSEL, NLPERF) or
INFORMATION (when NLMOPTS, NLSSEL, AUTO) message (26251) will be issued in the f06 detailing the
unsupported input data. For this demonstration problem, this message is entirely absent due to all input being supported.
When the MUMPS solver is used (default for NLPERF), additional messaging related to the MUMPS solver memory
requirements are issued in the f04:
13:00:05     0:31      434.0         0.0        27.4        0.0    SOLVE    BGN

The messaging here indicates that for this invocation of the MUMPS solver, MUMPS needs 9.024 GB to remain fully in-
core. In case this memory amount is not available, then the MUMPS solver will automatically go out-of-core, provided
that a minimum of 3.106 GB is available. If out-of-core processing is preferred, the MDLPRM,PRDOOC option can be
specified as detailed in the MSC Nastran 2024.1 Release Guide.
Additionally, with NLPERF , while NLOPRM case control command is not yet fully supported by NLPERF , by default
messages equivalent to NLOPRM = NLDBG=N3DSUM will be output to the f06. This includes the summary of contact

&lt;p&gt;Note that, for this model, while the default contact tolerance (ERROR) of 1/20th of the minimum edge length is

identified with N/A.
Finally, due to frictional convergence checks implemented with NLPERF , for each body in frictional contact, frictional
convergence messaging is issued to the f06:
*** USER INFORMATION MESSAGE 25194 (NMINCIT)

NUMBER OF NODES IN CONTACT     = 392
TOTAL FRCITION FORCE CHANGE    = 3.773220E+00

CURRENT TOTAL NORMAL FORCE     = 1.590394E+04
FRICTION CONVERGENCE RATIO     = 1.000000E+00
MAXIMUM FRICTION FORCE CHANGE  = 5.677060E-02
CURRENT MAXIMUM FRICTION FORCE = 5.677060E-02
Here, contact touching and friction details are provided for each touching body with friction. The presented data indicates
that for body 11, for this particular iteration, the total friction force on the body is 3.7732 and the maximum friction force
on any node of the body is 5.677E-2. For each touching body that has friction, a ratio of the total friction force change to
total friction force is checked against a friction convergence tolerance (Default = 0.05). If this is not satisfied, the Newton-
Raphson iteration is repeated. If the tolerance is specified as 0 or negative on the BCPARA card, this check will be skipped.
Performance Comparison between CNLS and NLPERF
The leaf spring model has 183960 CHEXA elements and 239333 GRIDs providing a 0.72 M DOF model. For the sake
of performance comparison between CNLS and NLPERF , this model is relatively small and can be solved on a personal
workstation. Performance comparisons for larger models are discussed in the MSC Nastran 2024.1 Release Guide.
The performance comparison between CNLS and NLPERF is shown in Figure 58-1 and Figure 58-2. Here, when comparing
CNLS and NLPERF for runs from serial to SMP=32, we see the expected behavior that the CNLS scales well only to about
8 cores while NLPERF continues to scale up to the 32 cores tested.
After 8 cores, the wall time from CNLS sees no further decrease and can increase due to increased overhead computation.
In contrast, the NLPERF wall time continues to decrease. In the serial runs, NLPERF provides a 30% speedup, while
comparing the best CNLS wall times (3200 s for SMP=8 and 3188 s for SMP=16) to the best observed NLPERF wall time
(926 s), NLPERF offers a 3.4x speedup.&lt;/p&gt;

NLPERF . While the % lines associated with SOL 400 convergence information in the f06 file remain available, the itr file

This output provides, at a glance, the singularity ratio and the critical grids participating in both the residual-based
convergence criteria and the displacement-based convergence criteria.
The singularity ratio (= 1/ matrix condition number), in particular, is a good measure of stability of the model. A poorly
constrained model with unstable contact can have a low singularity ratio (&amp;lt; 1E-8). For every factor of 10 drop in singularity
ratio, the accuracy of the numerical analysis drops by a factor of 10. So, it is important to have a good singularity ratio in
general (&amp;gt;1E-6) through a combination of provided user constraints and contact constraints. If a matrix encounters non-
positive definiteness, then the MUMPS solver in NLPERF will automatically invoke the non-positive definite solver and
repeat the solution. Such a solution, however, reflects the basic instability of the model and should be treated with caution.
Use of AUTOSPC or other direct modeling methods such as manual spring elements with small stiffness could be used to
improve the matrix conditioning. In the present iteration, the graduated leaves are well-constrained through the bolts and
the singularity ratio is of the order of 8.39E-4.
The convergence history via the itr file has been loaded in the convergence monitoring tool in Figure 58-3. While this shows
a static view, the primary use for the convergence monitoring tool is during the analysis. Both the printed output (left side)
and the graphical output (right side) update automatically as the NLPERF job prints to the itr file. The top graph shows
the overall incremental view of the convergence history, while the bottom graph shows the granular, cycle-based view of
the convergence history. Figure 58-4 shows a section of the convergence history zoomed in to see the details of the
convergence criteria (shown as horizontal dashed lines) being met. This zoom is achieved using the middle mouse wheel
while hovering over the vertical axes of the graphs.&lt;/p&gt;

equivalent with maximum displacement resultant only differing in the 0.01%. For completeness Figure 58-5 shows the
displacement resultant for the leaf spring analysis performed with NLPERF at the end of the analysis.
In contrast to displacement, the contact frictional force resultant does show a notable difference between NLPERF and
CNLS. When inspecting the f06, the leaf spring analysis with NLPERF issues twelve such information messages:
*** USER INFORMATION MESSAGE 25192 (NMINCIT)
REITERATING INCREMENT DUE TO FRICTION CONVERGENCE RATIO LARGER THAN 5.000000E-02.
Which indicate that beyond other sources of reiteration (e.g., residual convergence), the frictional convergence ratio was
the deciding factor in the result reiteration. While this message appears twelve times, the NLPERF analysis only requires
three more iterations than the CNLS (serial) analysis. Figure 58-6 shows the iteration count differences between the
NLPERF analysis and CNLS analysis specifically noting the number of iterations where the frictional convergence check
was dominant. Figure 58-7 shows the resulting contact friction force comparison on one of the rebound clips (PID=8) which
demonstrates the effect of the frictional convergence check, while, for completeness, Figure 58-8 shows the resulting contact
normal force comparison which shows a negligible difference between the analyses.
For more details on the frictional convergence check and other potential sources of results differences between NLPERF
and CNLS, refer to the MSC Nastran 2024.1 Release Guide.

Summary
Introduction
Bolt modeling is important in the analysis of structural assemblies where parts need to be joined together using bolts or
rivets. Bolt capability simulates the effect of bolt pre-tension and shortening by modifying the elements on one side of a
cross-section in the bolt. The functionality also provides a general way to model pre-stressed structural components under
specified loads or prescribed displacements. This example demonstrates an easy-to-use pre-tension bolt modeling
capability, BOLT1, which supports SOL 400 nonlinear analysis with advanced nonlinear elements and large rotation.
The BOLT1 functionality allows modeling the effect of bolt pre-tension without the need for duplicating grid points or
splitting the bolt finite element mesh into top and bottom parts around the bolt cross-section. The bolt is conveniently
modeled as a contiguous component and finite element mesh. The connection of the bolt cross-section with the control
grid point, where the loads are applied, is taken care of by internal modifications to the cross-section elements. This greatly
simplifies the bolt modeling process especially if the model has a large number of bolts. In addition, the bolt’s axial direction

large rotation.

FEM Modeling
Using the BOLT1 entry, the user has two options to input the data required for bolt modeling: the cross-section method
and the simple method.
By using the cross-section method, the user has more control in defining the bolt axial direction and cross-section selection.
The user enters the vector defining the bolt axis, enters the list of grid points forming the bolt cross-section as well as the
list of elements sharing cross-section grid points and lying on the opposite side of the normal vector. These are the elements
that will be internally connected to the bolt control grid point.
Using the simple method of BOLT1 entry, modeling of bolts is further simplified by not requiring the user to enter the
bolt axial direction or define the bolt cross-section nodes or select the layer of elements where the pre-tension loads will be
applied. The user only needs to enter the list of elements forming the complete bolt and the program will automatically
find the bolt normal direction and choose the cross-section nodes and elements. The code will find the centroid of the bolt,
determine the bolt axial direction by examining the value of the bolt principal moment of inertia around the centroid then
select the bolt cross-section by finding the lists of nodes and elements passing through the centroid and perpendicular to
the axial direction.
The details of the bolt modeling for the two cases are discussed below:
Case 1:  A bolted flange connection undergoing large rotation.
As shown in Figure 59-1, the model consists of two flanges belonging to two different components (pipe segments, pressure
vessels, or any other equipment) that are fastened together using 18 bolts. The finite element models for the bolts use a
variety of low-order and higher-order solid elements including CHEXA, CTETRA, CPENTA and CPYRAM elements. A
pre-tension force is first applied at the bolts and locked to ensure proper tightening. The assembly is then subjected to a
rigid body rotation of 90 degrees. The purpose of this test case is to demonstrate BOLT1 usage for bolts modeled with solid
elements as well as the capability of dealing with large rotation.

As shown in Figure 59-2, the model consists of a solid block and a plate that are fastened together using 3 bolts. The bolts
are modeled using beam elements while the bolt heads and nuts are modeled using solid elements. Contact algorithm is
used to establish contact between the different components. A pre-tension force is first applied at the bolts. Next, bolt pre-
tension is locked by constraining the bolt control grid points. The assembly is then subjected to a rigid body rotation of 90
degrees applied through the rotation of a rigid contact body attached to one end of the plate. The purpose of this test case
is to demonstrate the large rotation capability of BOLT1 modeled using beam elements.

Introduction
An axisymmetric steel punch is compressed on an aluminium cylinder. It is assumed that the material behavior is linear
elastic. The punch is loaded by a uniform pressure with magnitude P = 100 N/mm2 in the axial direction. The effect of
friction is studied along the contact zone. Axisymmetric 2-D solutions are used to serve as a target solution for a 3-D
analysis. For the 3-D solutions, one quarter of the assembly is modeled, using symmetry conditions. (Ref: NAFEMS, 2006,
Advanced Finite Element Contact Benchmarks , Benchmark 2, 3-D Punch (Rounded Edges) Contact)
Solution Requirements
Both 2-D (axisymmetric) and 3-D solutions are requested. T wo solutions, one frictionless and the other using a friction
coefficient of 0.1 between the punch and foundation, are requested. The displacement, force, and stress fields in the contact
zone (contacting surface of the punch and contacted surface of the foundation) are of interest and are obtained with both
linear and parabolic elements in the axisymmetric case and with linear elements in the 3-D case. The SOL 400 elements
specified through suitable extensions to the PLPLANE  or PSOLID entries are demonstrated. In the 3-D case, solutions obtained
with these elements are also compared to those obtained using existing HEX elements.
The solutions presented include:
Radial displacement of top contact surface of punch as function of coordinate.
Contact force, friction force, and contact pressure distributions as a function of coordinate.Element type Axisymmetric
4-node linear elements
8-node parabolic elements
3-D continuum
8-node linear elements

FEM Solutions
Numerical solutions have been obtained with MSC Nastran’s solution sequence 400 for multiple 2 -D axisymmetric and 3-
D cases. The axisymmetric cases include linear and parabolic elements, with and without friction. The 3-D case includes
linear elements with and without friction.
The contact, material, geometry, convergence, and other parameters are explained below - primarily with respect to the
axisymmetric linear element case and are representative for both 2-D and 3-D cases.
Contact Parameters
The element mesh using axisymmetric linear elements is shown in Figure 2-1 and is further described as follows: Two contact
bodies (defined by BCBODY  and BSURF ), one identified as the punch and the other identified as the foundation, are used.
Pressure is applied at the top of the punch in the axial direction. The bottom of the punch, in turn, compresses the
foundation. Typical element length along the punch and foundation is 4 mm and 3.5 mm, respectively. Contact body ID
4 is used to identify the punch and body ID 5 is used to identify the foundation.
BCBODY   4       2D      DEFORM  4       0      .1      -1
BSURF    4       1       2       3       4       5       6       7

&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;.
BCBODY  with ID 4 is identified as a two-dimensional deformable body with BSURF  ID 4 and friction coefficient of 0.1.
Furthermore, -1 on the 8th field indicates that BCBODY 4  is described as an analytical body, wherein the discrete facets
associated with the element edges are internally enhanced by using cubic splines. Since the punch has rounded edges in the
contact zone, using an enhanced spline representation of the punch yields better accuracy. The minus sign indicates that
the nodal locations defining the spline discontinuities are automatically determined. Note that since the foundation is a
rectangular shape with sharp angles, using the spline option with this body is not necessary since it would only increase the
computational cost without an associated improvement in accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

BCTABLE  with ID 0 is used to define the touching conditions at the start of the analysis. It should be noted that this is a
required option that is required in SOL 400 for contact analysis. It is flagged in the case control section through the
optional BCONTACT (Case)  = 0 option. Note that BCTABLE 0  and other contact cards with ID 0 (e.g., BCPARA 0 ) would be
applied at the start of the analysis even without the BCONTACT = 0 option. For later increments in the analysis, BCONTACT
= 1 in the case control section indicates that BCTABLE  with ID 1 is to be used to define the touching conditions between
the punch and the foundation.
The BCPARA  bulk data entry shown below for the frictional linear axisymmetric case defines the general contact parameters
to be used in the analysis:

Main Index
Note that ID 0 on the BCPARA  option indicates that the parameters specified herein are applied right at the start of the
analysis and are maintained through the analysis unless some of these parameters are redefined through the BCTABLE&lt;br&gt;
option. Important entries under BCPARA  option include FTYPE  - the friction type, RVCNST  - the slip-threshold value and
the BIAS  - the distance tolerance bias. As per general recommendation, BIAS  is set to 0.9 (note that the default value of
BIAS  is 0.9). For the frictional case, FTYPE  is set to 6 (bilinear Coulomb model) and RVCNST  is set to 1e-4  (this is a
non-default value that is used in this particular problem - the need for a non-default value is discussed in more detail later).
Note that when other parameters on the BCPARA  option like ERROR  (distance tolerance), FNTOL  (separation force) are not
specified, left as blank or specified as 0, program calculated defaults are used. It should also be noted that while the BCPARA&lt;br&gt;
parameters generally apply to all the bodies throughout the analysis, some of the parameters like ERROR , BIAS , FNTOL  can
be redefined via the BCTABLE  option for specific body combinations and for specific times through the analysis.
Material/Geometry Parameters
The two material properties used herein for the punch and foundation are isotropic and elastic with Young’s modulus and
Poisson’s ratio defined on MATBV  as
$ Material Record : steel
MAT1     1      210000.         .3

For the 2-D case, axisymmetric elements are chosen via the CQUADX  option pointing to a PLPLANE  entry which in turn, points
to an auxiliary PSHLN2  entry as shown below.

PSHLN2  1       1       1                                               +&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  C8      AXSOLID Q
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where the C4 entries indicate that linear 4-noded full integration axisymmetric solid elements are to be used and the C8
entries indicate that parabolic 8-noded full integration axisymmetric solid elements are to be used. Note that the PSHLN2&lt;br&gt;
entry enables SOL 400 to access a robust 2-D element library featuring linear and parabolic plane stress, plane strain or
axisymmetric elements. Multiple element topologies (4-noded, 6-noded, 8-noded) can be defined as plane stress, plane
strain, or axisymmetric through the PSHLN2  options. These elements which can be used for isotropic/orthotropic/
anisotropic elastic/elasto-plastic applications augment previous SOL 400 hyperelastic element technology that could be
used in conjunction with the PLPLANE  and MATHP  options.
For the 3-D case, hex elements are chosen via the CHEXA  option pointing to a PSOLID  entry. For elastic or small strain
applications, the user has two choices: Use existing 3-D solid elements with just thePSOLID  option or use 3-D solid
element technology accessed by the PSOLID  entry pointing to an auxiliary PSLDN1  entry. For large strain elasto-plastic
applications, the user should always use the 3-D solid elements; i.e., the primary usage of the 3-D solid elements is for large
strain elasto -plasticity for which the PSLDN1 + NLMOPTS ,LRGSTRN,1  bulk data entry is recommended. However, as in the
current example, these elements can also be used for elastic applications when used in conjunction with PSLDN1  and with
NLMOPTS ,ASSM,ASSUMED  entry.
Convergence Parameters
The nonlinear procedure used is defined through the NLPARM  entry:
NLPARM   1       10              PFNT     0       25     UP       YES&lt;/p&gt;

Results
Main Index
where 10 indicates the total number of increments; PFNT  represents Full Newton-Raphson Technique, wherein the
stiffness is reformed at every iteration; KSTEP = 0  in conjunction with PFNT  indicates that the program automatically
determines whether the stiffness needs to be reformed after the previous load increment is completed and the next load
increment is commenced. The maximum number of allowed recycles is 25 for every increment and if this were to be
exceeded, the load step would be cut-back and the increment repeated. UP indicates that convergence will be checked using
both displacements ( U) and residual criteria ( P). YES indicates that intermediate output will be produced after every
increment (note that this has been turned to NO for the 3-D case due to voluminous output). The second line of NLPARM&lt;br&gt;
is omitted here, which implies that default convergence tolerances of 0.01 will be used for U and P. It should be noted that
the PFNT  iterative method used conducts checking over incremental displacements and is generally more stringent than for
the FNT iterative method which convergence is checked over weighted total displacements.
Case Control Parameters
Some of the case control entries to conduct these analyses are highlighted as follows: SUBCASE (Case)  1 indicates the case
being considered. There are no STEP (Case)  entries in this analysis since a single loading sequence is being considered. For
multiple loading sequences that follow one another, STEP  entries can be used within a single SUBCASE  to identify each
sequence. BCONTACT (Case)  = 1 is used to indicate the contact parameters for SUBCASE 1 . NLPARM (Case)  = 1 is used to flag
the nonlinear procedure for SUBCASE  1. In addition to regular output requests like DISPLACEMENT (Case) , STRESS  (Case) ,
the option that is required for contact related output in the F06 file is BOUTPUT (Case) . It should be noted that with the
BOUTPUT  option, one can obtain normal contact forces, frictional forces, contact normal stress magnitudes, and contact
status for the contact nodes.
Results
The radial displacements obtained for the frictionless and frictional cases for the linear axisymmetric element case are
compared in Figure 2-2. The results match very well with the corresponding NAFEMS results (Benchmark 2 of NAFEMS
2006).
It is noteworthy to study the effect of the slip threshold value, RVCNST , on the friction results. The radial displacements for
two different values of RVCNST  are compared in Figure 2-3. It is seen that RVCNST  has a significant influence on the radial
displacements. It should be noted that the default value of RVCNST  is calculated as 0.0025 times the average edge length
of all elements that can participate in contact. For the linear axisymmetric problem, the default RVCNST  is of the order of
0.015. Relative radial displacements which are smaller than this value imply a transition zone and the frictional force
linearly increases from 0 to the peak value within this zone. In order to capture the frictional force and the relative sliding
more accurately, a smaller value of RVCNST (= 1e-4)  is required in this problem. In general, for friction problems, a
good check to be made from the f06 file or by postprocessing is whether the friction force is of the order of Fn, where 
is the friction coefficient and Fn is the nodal contact normal force.&lt;/p&gt;

The contact normal force and friction force along the punch for the linear axisymmetric element is plotted in Figure 2-4. It
is instructive to check that equilibrium is well-maintained (the sum of the contact forces transmitted via the punch should
be equal to the total force being applied to the punch). It can be shown that the sum of all contact forces at the punch-
foundation interface is within .03% of the total force applied on the punch .
Also, the friction forces are about 0.1 times the contact normal forces. The contact pressure is plotted for the contacting
nodes for both the linear and parabolic axisymmetric elements of the punch in Figure 2-5. The parabolic solution shows a Friction NAFEMS No Friction0 2 04 06 08 0 1 0 0

rather oscillating type of behavior. Also, as may be expected, the parabolic solution shows a more localized stress peak. These
trends are consistent with the NAFEMS benchmark 2 results.
The oscillatory behavior can be improved by  refining the mesh in the contact zone (and the surrounding part assuring
connection  with the remaining part of the structures).

Modeling Tips
While the contact checking algorithm in SOL 400 provides a number of options for the searching order via the
ISEARCH  parameter on the BCTABLE  option, the user should be aware of a few recommendations regarding the
touching (secondary)  body and the touched ( primary)  body: The touching body should be convex, generally be
less stiff, and be more finely meshed than the touched body. This allows for better conditioning of the matrices
and provides for better nodal contact. Note that these recommendations may not all be satisfied at the same time;
for example, in this benchmark, the punch which has been identified as the first body is convex and smaller than
the foundation but has a slightly coarser mesh and is somewhat stiffer than the foundation.
The accuracy of the friction solution should be judged by checking that the frictional forces at the nodes are
generally equal to Fn. If this is violated, the slip-threshold value, RVCNST , may need to be adjusted. Note also
that to ensure a quality solution with friction, in general, the incremental displacements need to converge well.
This can be ensured by using PFNT  on the NLPARM  option and checking on U.
The PSHLN2  entry in conjunction with PLPLANE  entries allows the users to flag 2-D elements for plane stress, plane
strain, or axisymmetric applications with isotropic/orthotropic/ anistropic elastic/elasto-plastic materials.
Similarly, PSLDN1  entries in conjunction with PSOLID  entries allows the users to flag nonlinear 3-D solid continuum
elements. The 2-D elements offer a range of abilities for small strain and large strain elastic/elasto-plastic analysis.
The fundamental application of the 3-D elements is for large strain elasto-plastic applications, wherein use should
be made of the NLMOPTS ,LRGSTRN,1  option to flag appropriate element behavior. It should be noted that the 3-
D elements can also be used in the elastic regime (as in this current example - see nug_02em.dat ). In such
situations, it is highly recommended that one not use NLMOPTS ,LRGSTRN,1  but use NLMOPTS ,ASSM,ASSUMED&lt;br&gt;
to ensure better behavior in elastic bending. Existing 3-D element technology for SOL 400 can be used for elastic
applications too (see nug_02en.dat  for example). In this case, one simply uses NLPARM  without the PSLDN1&lt;br&gt;
addition.&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction
This benchmark problem is an approximation of the Numisheet 2002 – Benchmark B problem. Simulations are carried
out using MSC Nastran solution sequence 400 to find the angles before and after spring back. Experimental results are
available for this benchmark, but it is noted that the sheet is slightly anisotropic. The text setup and reference details of
these experimental results are given in Figure 3-1. The current problem uses an isotropic elastic-plastic hardening behavior.

FEM solutions have been obtained with MSC Nastran’s solution sequence SOL 400 for the 2-D plane strain and 3-D shell
representations of the present sheet metal forming problem. The details of finite element models, contact simulations,
material, load, boundary conditions, and solution procedure of both the 2 -D plane strain and 3-D shell approaches are

Finite Element Models
The finite element model used for the 2-D plane strain approach is shown in Figure 3-3. The punch and die are modeled in
analytical form. The finite element mesh for the sheet contains 850 elements with 5 elements over the thickness. Only half
of the sheet is modeled. The applied element lengths can be determined from Table 3-1. MSC Nastran’s 2-D plane strain

Contact Models
In defining the contact model for the 2-D plane strain case, the sheet is modeled as a deformable body and the punch and
die are modeled as rigid bodies. Elements comprising the sheet are used to generate a deformable contact body with ID 4
using the following BCBODY  and BSURF  entries. Contact body ID 5 is used to define the load controlled rigid body with a
control node ID 1 for the punch and contact body ID 6 is used to define the position controlled rigid body for the die.
The geometry profiles of these rigid bodies are defined using 2-D NURB curves that describe the true surface geometry
and most accurately represent the punch and die geometry. The friction factor of 0.1342 is defined for all these contact
bodies.

The following BCPARA  bulk data entry defines the general contact parameters to be used in the analysis. The ID 0 on the
BCPARA  option indicates that the parameters specified herein are applied right at the start of the analysis and are
maintained through the analysis unless some of these parameters are redefined through the BCTABLE  option.
Important entries under BCPARA  option include: FTYPE  – the friction type and the BIAS  - the distance tolerance bias. For
all the models, the bias factor, BIAS , is set to 0.99. The bilinear Coulomb friction model is activated by setting FTYPE  to
6. For the models without friction, FTYPE  is set as 0.

with ID 1, 2 and 3 are used to define the touching conditions for later steps in the analysis, and it is flagged using the option
BCONTACT = n  (where n is the step number 1, 2 or 3) in the case control section. T wo contact pairs are defined in the
BCTABLE  option: one between the sheet and punch and one between the sheet and die. Both the 2-D plane strain and 3-

Loading and Boundary Conditions
The following set of boundary conditions has been applied for both 2-D plane strain and 3-D shell models:
Symmetry conditions (i.e., no displacement in horizontal direction) have been applied to the left size of the strip
For the position controlled rigid body used for the die surface, all degrees of freedom have been suppressed. For
the control node of the load controlled rigid body used for the punch surface, the displacement components in
horizontal directions are suppressed, while the displacement in vertical direction is specified as a function of the
time (refer to Table 3-3).
The following data in the case control section of the input file defines the load and boundary conditions at the four different
steps of the analysis. The bulk data entries SPCD, SPCR and SPC1 are used to define the loads in these steps. The SPCD  data
presented here shows the application of the imposed downward displacement of 28.5 in vertical direction in steps 1 and 2
at node 1 for the 2-D plane strain model. A similar imposed displacement is applied at node 1198 for the 3-D shell model.
The SPCR  data presented here shows the application of the imposed upward relative displacement of 10.0 in vertical
direction in step 3 and its fixation in step 4 at node 927 for the 2-D plane strain model. A similar imposed relative
displacement is applied at node 1167 for the 3-D shell model.

Solution Procedure
The present analysis of metal forming and gradual spring back is carried out in four different steps on both the 2-D plane
strain and 3-D shell models. In each of these models, the analysis has been carried out for the cases with and without friction
using SOL 400 in MSC Nastran. The first step analyses the metal forming process, the second step is used to achieve a
more accurate solution before the spring back analysis starts in steps 3 and 4.
In the first step, the metal forming operation is simulated by applying a vertical downward displacement of punch. The
nonlinear procedure is defined through the following NLSTEP  entry with ID 1. Here 100 indicates the total number of
increments; PFNT  represents Pure Full Newton-Raphson Technique wherein the stiffness is reformed at every iteration; 500
is the maximum number of allowed recycles for every increment. UP indicates that convergence will be checked on
displacement ( U) and residuals ( P). The 0.01  defined in the fourth line of NLSTEP  indicates the convergence tolerances
of 0.01 for displacement and residual checking. The negative sign of displacement tolerance indicates that iteration on
displacements will be checked against the incremental displacement quantity instead of total displacement.
The second step is considered to be a dummy one in which the load applied in the first step is maintained with very fine
convergence tolerances on displacement and residual. This step is used to ensure that the model reaches the good
equilibrium condition at the end of step 2 and before starting step 3 involving the more complex spring back operation. It
can be seen from the NLSTEP ID 3 that this spring back operation is done over 200 increments with a convergence check
only on displacement.

Figure 3-6  Various Deformed Stages during Spring Back Step
In the analysis without friction, contact is initially present between the sheet and the lower section of the punch. Near the
end of the deformation, the sheet separates at the lower section of the punch and gets in contact with the lower section of
the die. As soon as this contact is detected, the sheet is further bent into the final shape and the required force in the force
displacement history curve increases ( Figure 3-5). In the analysis with friction, the deformation behavior is different. The
tangential forces due to friction result in a stretching of the sheet causing contact between the punch and the sheet to be
present during the complete forming history.
The characteristic load displacement curves for the analysis from SOL 400 without friction and with friction are shown in
Figure 3-7. The differences in the shape of the curves are caused by the different contact conditions at the end of the forming
stage.&lt;/p&gt;

Observe that the unloading stage is analyzed in two steps. In the first unloading step the punch and the strip are moved
simultaneously in upward direction. This releases the strip from the die, while it remains in contact with the punch. In the
second unloading step the strip is fixed in vertical direction while the punch is moved further upward to its original
position. This gradually releases the strip from the punch and allows it to spring back to its final configuration. Note that
the fixation of the strip is such that there are no reaction forces after it has lost contact with both the die and the punch.
This, of course, is a requirement in order to capture the proper spring back behavior. The fixation primarily serves to
suppress rigid body motions of the model during the unloading stage.
The characteristic values of the angles at the end of the forming stage and after removal of the tool are listed in Table 3-4.
A comparison of the results obtained with Marc and SOL 400 of MSC Nastran is shown in Figure 3-8 (no friction) and
Figure 3-9 (friction). In the last figure, a comparison is also made with the experimental result. The results from SOL 400
are found to be on the higher side, particularly towards the end of forming. The results exhibit more oscillations in the load
displacement curve and this is caused by the use of hard contact approach in Marc and SOL 400. It should be noted that
no experimental data points are reported for the unloading.Table 3-4  Characteristic Angles during Forming and Release Process (2-

with friction, the results are compared with experimental predictions from Numisheet 2002. The predictions of SOL 400
from both 2-D plane strain case and 3-D shell models are found to match well with the experiment.
Modeling Tips
One of the complicating characteristics in this benchmark problem is a very local contact between the plate and the curved
shoulders of the die. In fact, the contact is almost a point (2-D) or line (3-D) contact with a large amount of sliding.
Contact is only verified between the nodes of the plate and the rigid dies. Hence, in the discrete steps of the displacement Table 3-5  Comparison of Angles for Plane Strain and Shell

history, points can be identified where no contact is detected; especially, if large elements are used near the shoulder of the
die.
The following are some guidelines and tips for modeling this benchmark:
A fine mesh has to be used to describe the contact of the nodes of the sheet with the die properly
A smooth representation of the die has to be chosen, either in an analytical form or by a piecewise linear curve
using a high number of segments
The unloading behavior is characterized by removal of the tools and at the same time adding boundary conditions
preventing the possibility of rigid body movement.
The unloading behavior should preferably be done in a number of steps. Note that in these steps low values of the
normal and, consequently, the friction forces are present which makes it difficult to obtain a converged solution
Numerical damping is often recommended to stabilize the solution, but it can be shown that this greatly
influences the accuracy of the solution.

Introduction
This application example evaluates the performance of contact algorithms at curved boundaries between deformable
bodies. A cylindrical pin is located in the cylindrical hole of a strip. The diameters of the hole and the pin are identical.
T wo equal point forces are applied to the center of the end surfaces of the pin. It is assumed that the tangential contact
forces can be described with a Coulomb friction model using friction coefficient 0.1. Due to the symmetry condition, a
quarter of the assembly is sufficient for the finite element analysis.
Solution Requirements
The displacement components and contact normal and tangential forces are of interest. In addition, the relative tangential
slips along the contact surfaces of the two bodies as functions of angle  (see Figure 4-1) are also worth investigating. One
analysis is conducted with MSC Nastran SOL 400 with standard HEX ( CHEXA ) elements and compared with available
advanced HEX elements. In the current version of MSC Nastran SOL 400, the advanced HEX elements are defined by a
PSOLID  entry pointing to an auxiliary PSLDN1  entry.&lt;br&gt;

FEM Solutions
Numerical solutions have been obtained with MSC Nastran solution sequence 400 for the 3-D case. First, the advanced 3-
D elements are used to conduct the analysis with contact and friction. In comparison, the same analysis is also conducted
with the standard 3-D solid elements.
The contact, material/geometry, solution/convergence schemes and other parameters are explained below.
Contact Parameters
The element mesh using the 3-D solid element is shown in Figure 4-2. The contact body named as cbody1  (shown in pink)
represents the pin. The contact body named as cbody2  defines the strip. A point load (black arrow) is applied at the center
point of top end of the pin. It should be noted that the symmetry has been taken into consideration.

The BCBODY  with ID 1 defines the pin as a three-dimensional deformable body. The BCBODY  with ID 2 defines the sheet
also as a three-dimensional deformable body. Furthermore, BCBODY  2 is described as an analytical body by set value of –
1 at the 8th field.
The BCTABLE  bulk data entries shown below define the touch conditions between the bodies:

As shown above, BCTABLE  with ID 0 is used to define the contact touching conditions at the start of the analysis. Zero
(0) identifies the case number. The BCTABLE  entry is mandatory for the contact analysis with SOL 400. Also, the options
(BCONTACT  with ID 0 and BCPARA  with ID 0) are all applied at the start of the analysis. For the loading analysis defined
as load case 1 under the case control section, the contact touching conditions are redefined by options of BCTABLE , BCPARA ,
and BCONTACT (Case)  with ID 1. In this example, the BCPARA  is only defined once because the parameters specified herein
are applied through the analysis from the beginning unless some of these parameters are redefined by BCTABLE  entry
with ID 1. It should be mentioned is that the BIAS  parameter is defined as 0.99 (the default value is 0.9).

As shown above, the material IDs are given as 1 and 2 for the pin and the sheet, respectively.
Case Control Parameters
There is a single loading sequence in the analysis. The control parameters are defined by the NLPARM (Case)  option. As shown
below, SUBCASE (Case)  with ID 1 defines all necessary conditions applied to the analysis which includes bulk data options:
TITLE (Case) , NLPARM (Case) , BCONTACT (Case) , SPC (Case) , LOAD (Case) , and requested output information. Particularly, it is
necessary to note the analysis control options NLPARM , NLMOPTS , and the parameter LGDISP . For the FE analysis with SOL
400, the advanced 8-node 3-D continuum elements are well designed for this type of analysis with large strain and large
displacement. In this example, the NLMOPTS  option defines that assumed strain formulation is used. The LGDISP&lt;br&gt;
parameter indicates that geometric nonlinearity includes the stiffness of follower forces. NLPARM  defines the loading
schemes used for the analysis. Here, the full Newton-Raphson method is used. The total number of loading increments is
set to 10. The maximum iteration for each increment is set to 25. The default convergence scheme is used and NO for
output of analysis results for intermediate loading steps except for the results at the end of the last loading increment.

Results
Numerical solutions have been done with current versions of MSC Nastran SOL 400 and Marc. As seen in Figure 4-3, a
relatively coarse mesh is used for the strip and a fine mesh is used for the pin. The nodes on the pin surface are defined as
secondary n odes and the surfaces of the strip are specified as primary c ontact surface in this analysis. In order to describe
the contact body more accurately, the contact surface of the strip is defined analytically. Therefore, a smoother surface
(Coons Patch) is used during the analysis for the strip.
Figure 4-3  Contact Normal Forces on the Contact Surfaces
The resulting contact normal nodal forces are shown in Figure 4-4. The peak value in the contact normal force is found to
be around 1933 N. The peak contact tangential force is found to be around 193 N, which equals to Fn. That is consistent
with the coefficient of friction applied during the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

For the comparison, another solution is obtained by using the existing solid element available in SOL 400. This element
type is defined by PSOLID  option only. The results are almost identical. Figure 4-7 compares of the displacement contours
obtained by MSC Nastran SOL 400 with the advanced 3-D solid elements and the standard 3-D solid elements (without
PSLDN1 option). It shows that both results are extremely close.

Modeling Tips
Convergence control: While the nonlinearity is quite mild in this problem, it is suggested to use both
displacement and residual convergence check due to the nonlinearity introduced by contact. Also, the full
Newton-Raphson iteration scheme is recommended for all SOL 400 analyses because the degree of nonlinearity
may be significant.
In this example, the body surface of the pin is defined as secondary n odes for the contact search against the
primary c ontact surface. Generally speaking, the contact body with finer mesh should be defined as secondary
contact surface because it is easy to be detected when the secondary n odes touch the primary s urface. Also, caution
must be used when choosing the BIAS  value. Smaller BIAS  value may be used to give better contact accuracy, but
may increase computation cost significantly if too small a value is applied.

Introduction
If a cylindrical steel roller rotates on a rubber base, it will have moved a distance less than the circumference of cylinder for
a complete rotation of the cylinder. This is due to the effect of friction and stretch of rubber under the stresses induced by
cylinder. Osborne Reynolds demonstrated this phenomenon in 1874. This contact benchmark will test the ability of solver
algorithms to model the movement of the two surfaces when they are in contact, as the rubber will stretch compared to the
steel cylinder.Displacement Boundary

The cylindrical roller with radius 30 mm is rotating over 360 degrees. The circumference of the cylinder is 188.5 mm. Point
A is the point on the rubber sheet just below the lowest point of the steel cylinder at the start of the analysis. The
displacement component of this point in the x-direction needs to be determined from this study. Following different 2D
and 3D models are considered for this benchmark.

FEM Modeling
FEM solutions have been obtained with MSC Nastran&amp;rsquo;s solution sequence SOL 400 for the 2-D plane strain and 3-D solid
representations of the present contact benchmark. The details of finite element models, contact simulations, material, load,
boundary conditions, and solution procedure of both the 2-D plane strain and 3-D solid approaches are discussed.
Finite Element Models
The finite element model used for the 2-D plane strain approach is shown in Figure 5-1. The rubber mat is meshed with 10
elements in the height direction and 120 elements in the horizontal direction with the element length of 2.5 mm along the
surface. The cylinder is meshed with 40 elements along the circumference resulting in an element length 4.71 mm.

The following BCPARA bulk data entry defines the general contact parameters used in the analysis. For all the models, the
bias factor BIAS is set to 0.95. The bilinear Coulomb friction model is activated by setting FTYPE to 6. The entry
METHOD is set to SEGTOSEG to activate the segment-to-segment contact with the activation of augmentation using
another entry AUGMENT set to 1. Node-to-segment contact is used in the absence of this entry METHOD. For this
benchmark, both node-to-segment and segment-to segment contact interactions are used in 2D and 3D simulations. The
entry IBSET is set to 0, to use contact separations based on forces. In the case of segment-segment contact, Nastran will
set this value to 2 internally to use separations based on absolution stress

Loading and Boundary Conditions
The following sets of boundary conditions have been applied for 2-D plane strain and 3-D solid models:
Horizontal movement of rubber strip is arrested in the 1st step
Vertical movement of bottom surface of rubber strip by 30mm in the 1st step and it is retained in that position in
the 2nd step.
Centre of the roller is fixed in horizontal and vertical directions in both steps 1 and 2
Centre of the roller is rotated by 360 degree in step-2
Symmetry conditions have been applied to both steel roller and rubber strip (only for 3D model)
The following SPC1 and SPCD cards are used to apply these displacement boundary conditions in the 2D model. Rotation
of rigid body for step-2 is applied using the TABLED1 card with ID 99, which is referred in BCRIGID card.  Similar cards
have been used to apply the displacement boundary conditions in the case of 3D model.

Solution Procedure
The analysis of this contact benchmark have been carried out in two steps for both 2-D plane strain and 3-D solid models
using SOL 400 in MSC Nastran. In the first step, the rubber strip is moved up by 30 mm with the steel roller constrained
in horizontal and vertical directions. In the second step, the steel roller is rotated by 360 degree with the rubber strip
compressed against the steel roller with 30 mm raised position from first step. The time stepping scheme and convergence
criteria used in these two steps are shown in the following NLSTEP entries.

The x-displacement values of point A in the rubber sheet has been obtained with MSC Nastran and MARC for various
models and these values are shown in Table 5.1. It is important to note that the circumference of steel roller is 188.5 mm
and hence the effect of contact with a stretched surface is clearly visible.
The prediction of x-displacement at point A from MSC Nastran and Marc for 2D and 3D models are consistent with the
published NAFEMS values.
The vertical reaction force on the steel roller has been plotted for MSC Nastran and Marc in Figure 5-6 and Figure 5-7. The
time 0-1 corresponds to the movement of the rubber strip in the steel roller direction. The time 1-2 corresponds to the
rotation of steel roller. The plots for node to segment contact is similar to results shown in NAFEMS models. The reaction Table 5-1  Displacement of point A after one rotation of the steel roller

Introduction
This problem verifies and validates the behavior of the bilinear friction model. A more detailed description of the bilinear
friction model can be found in the Release Notes  for MSC Nastran. The fundamental control parameter of this friction
model is the so-called relative sliding displacement below which (elastic) sticking is simulated. This parameter can be user-
defined by specifying RVCNST  on the BCPARA  option. Otherwise, MSC Nastran determines the default value as a function
of the average edge length of the elements in the contact bodies.
This example was originally proposed by NAFEMS as a 2-D large sliding contact and friction example. Here, we use a
modified version of the problem: namely 3-D instead of 2-D and an alternating load instead of a linearly increasing load.
A large displacement is expected in this solution but the strains will be pretty small. Assuming the motion as rigid body, it
can be predicted analytically as shown in the NAFEMS documentation ( NAFEMS Benchmark T ests for Finite Element
Modeling of Contact, Gapping and Sliding, 2001).
First, a gravity load is applied to the whole model. Then, a positive pressure px is applied as such that point A will have
displacement ux = 1 m . The next step, a negative pressure is applied as such that point A will have displacement ux = -1 m .
The last step is again an application of positive pressure px. The applied pressure px will be determined analytically.
The analysis results are presented with linear and parabolic elements.Element type 3-D solid with 4 -node linear and 10-node parabolic tetrahedral elements

Analytical Solution
Assuming a rigid body motion and neglecting the loss of energy due to friction, the relation among the total force on the
upper wedge in the x- and y-direction ( Fx and Fy), the friction coefficient ( ), the wedge angle (, the total spring stiffness
(K) and the positive displacement ( ux) of the upper wedge is:
With tan, , Fx = 1500 N,  Fy = 3058 N ( based on gy = -764.5 N)  and ux = 1 m,  the total spring stiffness ( K)
is 239 N/m . Thus, the applied px that correlates with is 1250 Pa.  This load is applied during the second step. Alternatively,
with the given value of K, tan, and Fy, Fx = -832.8 N  results in a displacement of the upper wedge ( ux = -1 m ).  px that
correlates with this  Fy is Fx = -693.375 N . This pressure is applied in the third step. The fourth step is again the
introduction of px = 1250 Pa.

A numerical solution has been obtained with MSC Nastran’s SOL 400 for the element mesh shown in Figure 6-1. The colored
regions of the wedges have been identified as contact bodies using the BCBODY  and BSURF  entries. Contact body IDs 1 and

The displacement plot of point A, for linear and parabolic elements, is shown in Figure 6-3. It is clearly seen that the upper
wedge moves alternately from ux = 1 m t o  ux = -1 m and then back to  ux = 1 m a s expected using the analytical solution.
The result of the linear element is nearly the same as that of the parabolic elements. As clearly seen from this figure, during
(linear) sticking contact, the displacement of the upper wedge varies linearly.

It is very important to have accurate coordinates for those points that are located on the both sides of the contact interfaces.
Failure in representing accurate smooth surfaces may lead to unexpected contact behavior. That is why the coordinate of
the grid points both for models with linear and parabolic elements are expressed in the extended format of MSC Nastran.

Introduction
This problem demonstrates the ability to model composite laminated material both using shell and solid elements. A
laminated strip is subjected to a three-point bending test, due to symmetry only a quarter of the structure needs to be
modeled. Interlaminar stress may be outputted based on the ply coordinate system which user selects. Stresses and
displacements are computed and compared to a reference solution.Title Chapter 7: Laminated Strip under Three -point Bending

Solution Requirements
The stresses and displacements of a composite laminated strip under three-point bending configuration are calculated in
MSC Nastran. This test is recommended by the National Agency for Finite Element Methods and Standards (U.K.): T est
R0031/1 from NAFEMS publication R0031, “Composites Benchmarks”, February 1995.
FEM Solution s
A numerical solution has been obtained with MSC Nastran’s solution sequence SOL 400 for the configuration shown in
Figure 7-1. The composite strip comprises seven lamina, with lamina thicknesses and orientation as shown in the figure.
Only one quarter of the structure is modeled using symmetry conditions along the mid span and center of the longitudinal
direction. Each lamina is modeled as one layer is the composite. For the model using shell elements, this is done using the
PCOMP  entry

Results
Table 7-1 compares the results of the different models with the reference solution, the data is taken from the f06 file. The
stress at E is linearly interpolated from the centroid of the first two elements close to the symmetric line.
Modeling Tips
When modeling composite structures that support large deformation and nonlinear material behavior (activated with the
PSHLN1  or PCOMPLS  entry) it is recommended to set the TSHEAR  parameter on the NLMOPTS  entry. This will result in a more
parabolic shear distribution through the thickness, and in the output of interlaminar stresses. When using CHEXA  elements
for analysis of shell-like structure under bending deformation, it is recommended to use solid shell elements instead of
linear composite brick elements.

Introduction
This problem demonstrates the ability to model pressure and thermal loading for composite laminated material. A thick
cylinder is loaded with both pressure and a temperature increase. Stresses are calculated and compared to a reference
solution.
Solution Requirements
The Hoop stress at the inner and outer cylinders is calculated under pressure loading and under both pressure loading and
thermal loading in MSC Nastran. This test is recommended by the National Agency for Finite Element Methods and
Standards (U.K.): Test R0031/2 from NAFEMS publication R0031, “Composites Benchmarks”, February 1995
FEM Solutions
A numerical solution has been obtained with MSC Nastran’s SOL 400 for the configuration shown in Figure 8-1. The
cylinder consists of two layers with layer thickness and orientation as shown in Figure 8-1. The axial displacement is set to
zero at z = 0. Only one eighth of the model is analyzed with the appropriate symmetry boundary conditions. The two layers
are modeled using the PCOMP  entry, where the thickness of both layers is 2 mm

Two types of shell elements are analyzed: the CQUAD4  default and the CQUAD4 suitable for large deformations. The latter

Introduction
This problem demonstrates the ability to model pressure loading of a square composite three layer sandwich flat shell.
Stresses and displacements are calculated and compared to a reference solution.
Solution Requirements
Stresses and displacements are calculated at the surface of the composite three layer sandwich flat shell in MSC Nastran.
This test is recommended by the National Agency for Finite Element Methods and Standards (NAFEMS): T est R0031/3
from NAFEMS publication R0031, “Composites Benchmarks”, February 1995.
FEM Solution s
A numerical solution has been obtained with MSC Nastran’s SOL 400 for the configuration shown in Figure 9-1. The plate
consists of three layers, a core layer and two face sheets covering this layer. Thicknesses of the layers are shown in Figure 9-1.
Only one quarter of the part is analyzed with the appropriate symmetry boundary conditions, and the two edges on the
boundary of the plate are fixed. The three layers are modeled using the PCOMP  entry, where the thickness of both layers is
0.028 in.

For shell-like structure with composite materials, the TSHEAR  option on the NLMOPTS  entry has to be given to obtain a
parabolic shear distribution for composite layers in shells. This is particularly important for this structure because the inner
core resists deformation in shear.

When modeling composite structures using shell elements that support large deformation and nonlinear material behavior
(activated with the PSHLN1  entry), it is recommended to set the TSHEAR  parameter on the NLMOPTS  entry. This will result
in a more parabolic shear distribution through the thickness, and in the output of interlaminar stresses.

Introduction
A gasket is assembled between an engine block and a cylinder head. The loading of the assembled structure consists of pre-
tensioning the bolts connecting the cylinder head and the engine block. Striking features in this analysis are the MPCs used
to load the bolts, the geometry and material description of the gasket, and the use of the contact algorithm to establish
contact constraints between the grids of the gasket and the cylinder head and the engine block and between the grids of
the bolts and the cylinder head.
Solution Requirements
A numerical analysis will be performed to find the forces in the bolts and the response of the gasket in terms of gasket
closure versus gasket pressure.
Model Details
The gasket actually consists of two parts: the so-called gasket ring and the gasket body. These parts have different material
properties and thicknesses. Assigning different material properties is straightforward, but modeling different thicknesses
would require different finite element meshes for the ring and the body. Since this is inefficient from a modeling
perspective, it is allowed to include both parts in one connected set of finite elements and to define the thickness difference
as an initial gap. In the numerical analysis, this implies that as long as the thickness reduction of gasket element integration
points is smaller than the initial gap, there will be no stress in the thickness direction. In Figure 10-1, a detailed view of the
actual versus the modeled gasket geometry is shown.Element type 3-D 8-node hexahedral and 3-D 6-node pentahedral solid elements

The material behavior of a gasket is generally rather complex to characterize using conventional material models. Instead,
a special gasket material model is adopted, which de-couples the in-plane and thickness behavior. The in -plane behavior is
assumed to be linear and defined by Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio. The behavior in thickness direction is nonlinear
and defined by experimentally determined loading and unloading curves, where the gasket pressure is measured as a
function of the gasket closure. This gasket closure is given by the change in distance between the top and the bottom face
of the gasket. The loading and unloading curves for the gasket ring and the gasket body are shown in Figure 10-2.

In order to apply pre-tensioning on the bolts, they are piece wise modeled by two parts, one upper and one lower part,
obtained by a fictitious cut. The grids of the lower and the upper part of this cross section are connected using MPC’s to a
so-called control grid. Calling the displacement of a grid in the lower part , the displacement of a grid in the upper
part  and the displacement of the control grid , then the MPC reads:

By assigning all the grids in the lower and upper part of the section of a bolt to the same control grid, one can easily define
the shortening of a bolt by prescribing . As a result, the total bolt force is found as the reaction force on the control
grid.

The numerical solution has been obtained with MSC Nastran’s SOL 400 for the element mesh shown in Figure 10-3 using
3-D 8-node hexahedral and 6-node pentahedral elements. Based on symmetry, only half of the structure is modeled.

In total, four deformable contact bodies ( BCBODY ) are used. The first deformable body consists of all elements of the gasket
including the gasket body and ring. The cylinder head defines the second deformable body. The third deformable body
contains the elements of the engine block. Finally, the fourth deformable body consists of the upper and lower parts of the
bolts. The deformable contact bodies are identified as 3-D bodies referring to the BSURF  IDs 1, 2, 3 and 4:

•glued contact between the bolts and the cylinder head.
Compared to the cylinder head and the engine block, the gasket has the finest mesh and is also relatively soft. In general,
it is recommended to use the grids of the contact body with the finest mesh as the secondary g rids in the MPCs used to
solve the contact problem. If the mesh density in the contact area is comparable, then the grids of the softest body should
be chosen as the secondary g rids. In the current simulation, grids of the gasket and the bolts are selected as secondary g rids,
which is done using the BCTABLE  option. This option is also used to activate glued contact conditions, so that both relative
normal and tangential displacements in the contact areas are prohibited:

Besides indicating the secondary n odes and glued conditions, the first SECNDRY PRIMARY  combination also activates the
extended tangential contact tolerance. The reason to use this is motivated by the coarse mesh of the cylinder head (see
Figure 10-4) compared to the gasket. By activating the extended tangential contact tolerance, all grids at the top of the gasket
are found to be in contact with the cylinder head.

The PSLDN1  entry refers to the PSOLID  with ID number 1 and activates the solid continuum composite element formulation
via the SLCOMP  option. The material ID number 2 of the MATG  entry refers to MATBV  ID number 2 to define the in-plane
(membrane) behavior of the gasket material. The loading curve is defined by the table with ID number 1, while the
unloading curve is defined by the table with ID number 2. In general, up to ten unloading curves can be referred to, but
in this example only one unloading curve is used. The onset of irreversible behavior of the gasket material is defined by a
yield pressure of 52 MPa (see also Figure 10-2). As soon as the corresponding gasket closure has been exceeded, the unloading
behavior will be interpolated between the loading and the unloading curve. The tensile modulus (in case the gasket would
be loaded in tension) is set to 72 MPa and the transverse shear modulus to 35 MPa. The initial thickness difference between
the gasket ring and gasket body is reflected by the initial gap of 0.090909 mm.
The control grids for the bolt pre-tensioning, 4083 and 4095, are defined by GRID and CORD2R :

Alternatively, the BOLT  option can be used. Although the kinematic constraints involved are the same, the BOLT  option
has the following advantages:
the input format is more concise;
the option is easier to use in a contact analysis.
When the MPC entries are used, the user defined MPC&amp;rsquo;s may easily be conflicting with MPC&amp;rsquo;s introduced by the contact
algorithm, thus causing the contact constraints to be skipped. On the other hand, when the elements at both sides of the
cross section are included in the same contact body, then the BOLT option causes the contact algorithm to treat this cross
section in a special way, Consequently, grid points at the boundary of the cross section can touch another contact body,
while grid points touching the body with the cross section can slide along this body, even when the cross section has to be
passed.
Using the same control grids as mentioned above, the input of the BOLT entries is:

As discussed above, when using MPC’s or the BOLT functionality, the bolts were piece wise modeled by two parts, one
upper and one lower part, obtained by a fictitious cut, in order to apply pre-tensioning on the bolts using MPC’s. Another
alternative is to use the enhanced bolt modeling capability offered by BOLT1. The BOLT1 capability simulates the effect
of bolt pre-tension and shortening by modifying the elements on one side of an arbitrary cross-section in the bolt without
the need for splitting the bolt finite element mesh into top and bottom parts and duplicating the grid points on the bolt
cross-section. This greatly simplifies the bolt modeling process.
For the BOLT1 entry, the user has two options to input the data required for bolt modeling: the cross-section method and
the simple method.
Using the cross-section method, the user has more control in defining the bolt axial direction and cross-section selection.
The user enters the vector defining the bolt axis, enters the list of grid points forming the bolt cross-section as well as the
list of elements sharing cross-section grid points and lying on the opposite side of the normal vector. These are the elements
that will be internally connected to the bolt control grid point.
With the simple method of BOLT1 entry, modeling of bolts is further simplified by not requiring the user to enter the bolt
axial direction or define the bolt cross-section nodes or select the layer of elements where the pre-tension loads will be
applied. The user only needs to enter the list of elements forming the complete bolt and the program will automatically
find the bolt normal direction and choose the cross-section nodes and elements. The code will find the centroid of the bolt,
determine the bolt axial direction by examining the value of the bolt principal moment of inertia around the centroid then&lt;/p&gt;

select the bolt cross-section by finding the lists of nodes and elements passing through the centroid and perpendicular to
the axial direction.
The engine gasket model has been modified to use the BOLT1 capability. A new model is created in which bolts are not
split into top and bottom parts as shown in Figure 10-5. In the new model, the bolt control grid points, 4147 and 4148, of
the two bolts each has an enforced displacement on an SPCD Bulk Data entry of 0.175 mm representing the bolt
shortening preload.

Notice that the pre-tension prescribed displacements are applied at the 1st DOF (T1) of the control grids irrespective of
the bolt orientation.
The nonlinear procedure used is defined via the NLPARM  entry:

Here the FNT option is selected to update the stiffness matrix during every recycle using the full Newton-Raphson iteration
strategy. Convergence checking is performed based on displacements, forces, and work. For all criteria, the default error
tolerance is used. In order to avoid bi-sections, the field MAXDIV  is set to 10.

Figure 10-6 shows a plot of the displacement magnitudes in the structure corresponding to the maximum pre-tensioning of

Finally, Figure 10-8 displays the gasket pressure as a function of the gasket closure, both for the gasket ring and the gasket
body. As explained before, the gasket body has an initial gap which explains that the gasket pressure remains zero until this
gap is closed. The fact that the gasket pressure seems to already be nonzero for a gasket closer smaller than the initial gap
value (0.090909 mm) is due to the finite number of steps (10). Neither the gasket ring nor the gasket body is loaded yet
beyond the yield stress.

Contact Body Definition
Since the mesh of the engine block and the lower part of the bolts is a continuous mesh, the automated contact algorithm
will not be able to find a unique boundary description at the interface of the engine block and the bolts. This is reflected
by messages like:
warning: node      1407 belongs to bodies    3    4.
for the contact algorithm it will belong to body     3 only.
Although, in the current example, this will not affect the results (there will be no contact detection between the engine
block and the bolts), it is generally not recommended. Instead, one should either make sure that the lower part of the bolts
are separated from the engine block or include only the upper part of the bolts in the contact body definition.&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction
A model of a cylindrical pipe is subjected to crushing as rigid bodies above and below the pipe move inward towards each
other. The model is created using nonlinear thick shell elements to model the pipe and rigid surfaces above and below the
pipe. The problem attempts to quantify whether the movement of the external structures cause the plastic collapse of the
pipe. Initial contact with the external structures is expected to cause elastic deformation of the steel pipe. Additional
incremental movement potentially subjects the structure to stresses beyond the proportional limit of the material. The yield
stress defines the onset of plastic strains that may initiate the collapse of the structure walls. This exercise illustrates several
SOL 400 capabilities including large displacement analysis, contact analysis between rigid and deformable bodies, and large
strain plasticity modeled with an elastic-perfectly plastic model.Applied loads Both rigid bodies are moving towards the pipe in y-direction by 2in using load controlled
rigid body motion.

Solution Requirements
The large displacement elastic-plastic contact analysis is carried out using MSC Nastran SOL400 for this rigid to deformable
problem. The application of the nonlinear thick shell element is demonstrated by using the nonlinear extension PSHLN1&lt;br&gt;
option for the regular PSHELL  option. The following results from SOL 400 model are compared with the results obtained
from the Marc model.
Contour plot for y-displacement
Contour plot for plastic strain
FEM Solutions
A numerical solution has been obtained with MSC Nastran’s SOL 400 for a 3-D representation of the deformable pipe
structure and two semi-circular sections of rigid pipes sections. The details of finite element model, contact simulation,
material, load, boundary conditions, and solution procedure are discussed in this chapter.
Finite Element and Contact Model
The finite element mesh for the pipe contains 18 elements around the circumference and 18 elements along the length for
a total of 324 elements. MSC Nastran CQUAD4 elements with material ID 1 and thickness 0.4 inches are selected using the
following PSHELL and PSHLN1 entries. The PSHLN1  entry enables SOL 400 to access the thick shell elements with large strain
capabilities. The finite element model used for this simulation is shown in Figure 11-1.

In defining the contact model, the primary pipe section is modeled as a deformable body and the two external pipe
structures are modeled as rigid bodies. There will be 2 contact pairs. 1:Upper rigid body and Pipe, 2: Lower rigid body and
Pipe. Geometric Contact Parameters ( BCONPRG ) and Physical Contact Parameters ( BCONPRP ) for both the contact pairs have
been created separately. If contact interaction properties for both the pairs are same then same BCONPRG  and BCONPRP  can
be used for different pairs.

Introduction
This application example evaluates the performance of an adaptive load stepping scheme in the applications of MSC
Nastran SOL 400 for the FE analysis. Due to the symmetry condition, half of the assembly is sufficient for the finite
element analysis. This example involves thermal load, contact, material, and geometrical nonlinearity under pressure
loading. The geometry and material descriptions are given in the above summary table. There are two load steps. The first
step is to apply the thermal load by specifying the temperature changes at each node of the two eccentric cylinders. With
the thermal loading along with the given boundary conditions, the stress and strain are generated due to uneven thermal
expansion of the two cylinders. In the second loading step, a pressure is applied at the inside of the inner cylindrical surface.
Due to this pressure, the smaller cylinder expands in diameter and eventually fills the gap between the two cylinders when
the outer surface of the small cylinder progressively touches the inner surface of the outside cylinder.
Due to the strong nonlinearity, adaptive time stepping scheme is used. By the adaptive time stepping scheme, the step size
of each increment is adjusted at the end of step that just converged.
Solution Requirements
SOL 400 is used for the FE analysis of this problem. The advanced HEX element defined by PSOLID  entry pointing to an
auxiliary PSLDN1  entry is used. For the first loading step, the thermal strains and stresses of the two cylinders are of the
interests. For the second load step, the deformation and contact between two cylinders under pressure loading are
investigated. Due to the nonlinearity introduced by nonlinear material properties and contact, convergence speed varies
with the nonlinear deformation and changes of contact condition. In order to achieve fast and stable analysis, the time step
size is automatically adjusted according to the convergence condition. In the current version of MSC Nastran SOL 400, this
is done by adding the NLAUTO  option into the input data file. For comparison purposes, one analysis with Marc with the
solid element of the same formulation as the element in SOL 400 and auto step scheme is also conducted.Element type  8-node linear elements

The Advanced HEX Element
The FE model is shown in Figure 12-1. As mentioned earlier, two solutions are obtained. The first solution was obtained by
using the MSC Nastran SOL 400 with the advanced HEX ( CHEXA ) element, which is defined by the PSOLID  and PSLDN1  bulk

As shown above, BCTABLE  with ID 0 is used to define the touch conditions at the start of the analysis. 0 identifies the case
number. This BCTABLE  is mandatory for the contact analysis with SOL 400. Also, the options BCONTACT (Case)  with ID 0
and BCPARA  with ID 0 are all applied at the start of the analysis. For each load step, the touch condition can be defined
by BCTABLE , BCPARA , and BCONTACT (Case)  option.
Material/Geometry Parameters
Both bodies in this analysis are isotropic in terms of thermal and mechanical properties. Body one represents the inner
cylinder, which is also elasto-plastic. The Young’s modulus, Poisson ratio, and thermal expansion coefficient are defined by
MATBV  bulk data option. The plasticity properties are defined by MATEP  with TABLES1  option. Here, TABLES1  is associated
with MATEP  to defined the strain hardening rule of the material with ID 1.

Case Control Parameters
There are two loading sequences (or loading steps) in the analysis. In each loading sequence, the control parameters are
defined by the NLPARM (Case)  and the NLAUTO  option. The ID of the NLAUTO  option is linked with the identification
number of the NLPARM  option. This option must be used in conjunction with NLPARM . The NLAUTO  options are
specified in the bulk data area. As shown below, load STEP (Case)  ID 1 of SUBCASE (Case)  ID 1 defines all necessary conditions
applied to the analysis for the first load step which includes bulk data options ( TITLE (Case) , NLPARM (Case) , BCONTACT (Case) ,
SPC (Case) , LOAD (Case) ) and the requested output information. Particularly, it is necessary to note the analysis control options
of NLMOPTS  and the LGDISP  parameter. In this example, the NLMOPTS  option defines LRGS  to 1. It means that LARGE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;185 Chapter 12: Thermal/Pressure Loaded Cylinders
FEM Solutions
Main Index
STRAIN  formulation is used. The LGDISP  parameter indicates that geometric nonlinearity includes the stiffness of
follower forces.
NLPARM (Case)  defines the parameters to control the time step and convergence schemes. In this example, PFNT  means that
full Newton-Raphson method is adopted. The attempted total number of loading increments is set to 20. The maximum
iteration for each increment is set to 25. UP means the convergence scheme is set to check both the convergence of
displacements and residuals. In this loading sequence, both tolerances are set as 0.01. It is worth to note that a negative
value is set for the displacement check. The negative sign means the convergence check will be based on the incremental
displacement. And NO in the NLPARM  option means that it is not required to output the analysis results for intermediate
loading steps, except the results at the end of the loading sequence. However, the total number of loading increment may
be changed according to the parameters set in NLAUTO  option. In the first load step, the deformation is relatively small.
The desired number of iterations (1st field of the second line of NLAUTO  option) is set as 5. In the second load step, due
to contact and large deformation, the desired number of iteration is set as 7. To set a proper desired number of iterations
is critical to achieve the solution with minimum computation time and adequate accuracy. Too large numbers may cause
significant change of time step size between increments, which may cause the solution to converge slowly or even diverging.
If this happens, SOL 400 cuts the time step size back. As one of the consequences, the analysis may need even longer
computation time.
To avoid this, it is recommended to set a reasonably small value for the maximum ratio of incremental step size change
between incremental steps (the 6th field of the first line of the NLAUTO  option). This parameter is set as 10 with desired
number of iteration as 5 for load step 1. For the second load step, with consideration of the fact that contact and large
deformation may occur, this parameter is set as 1.2 with desired number of iterations as 7. This is particularly important
inorder to avoid penetration and also to control the time step size with good balance of efficiency and accuracy.

Load Step One
The initial temperature of the whole assembly is set as zero (0). In the first load step, a temperature load is applied to the
inner cylinder and part of the outside cylinder (see Figure 12-2 - yellow color). Due to the thermal expansion caused by the
temperature load and the corresponding changes of the material properties, thermal strain and stress are generated.
Figure 12-3 shows the distribution of major principal stress and the equivalent stress at the end of this load step. It is seen
that the distribution of stress is uneven through the wall thickness of the outside cylinder. However, the stress in the inner
cylinder is quite uniformly distributed (see Figure 12-3(b)). This is because the inner cylinder has a uniform temperature
load with minimum displacement boundary constraints. Therefore, it has nearly stress-free thermal expansion. With the
adaptive loading step scheme, the analysis of this loading sequence is completed in eight incremental steps.

Figure 12-3  Distributions
Load Step Two
This load step is to apply the pressure inside the inner cylinder. Due to the pressure loading, the inner cylinder expands in
diameter. At some point of loading, the gap between the two cylinders is closed. Figure 12-4 (a) shows the gap between two
cylinders at the beginning of this load step. Figure 12-4 (b) shows that the gap is completely closed after the pressure is fully
applied. Using the adaptive load step control, this load step is completed in 19 incremental steps. So the total number of
incremental steps for the analysis is 27 steps. The distribution of equivalent stress in the deformed cylinders is shown
inFigure 12-5. It is seen that the level of stress is higher in the inner cylinder. The lowest stress occurs on the outside cylinder
along its inner surface which is in contact with the outside surface of the inner cylinder. The lower level of stress is mainly
because of the softening of material due to increased temperature.

In addition to the analysis with MSC Nastran SOL 400, Marc is also used to conduct the analysis with the same type of
element and material and boundary condition definition. The results are quite close as shown in Figure 12-6(a) and
Figure 12-6(b). The analysis by Marc takes 16 incremental steps for the first load step and another 27 incremental steps for
the pressure loading step.

Modeling Tips
Convergence control:  While the nonlinearity is quite strong in the second load step, it is suggested to use both
displacement and residual convergence check due to the nonlinearity introduced by contact. Also, the full Newton-
Raphson iteration scheme is recommended for all SOL 400 analyses because the degree of nonlinearity is typically
significant.

Adaptive step size control: The NLAUTO  option with NLPARM  option provides the convenient interface for user to
control the analysis procedure. Proper setting of the control parameters is very important to obtain accurate results without
losing computational efficiency. A useful tip is to use loose control over the desired number of iteration but use tighter
control over the maximum ratio of time step change allowed after each converged step.
Contact control: In this example, the FE nodes of inner cylinder part are defined as secondary c ontact nodes. This is due
to the consideration that, during the pressure loading process, the inner cylinder will expand and intend to touch the inner
surface of the outside cylinder. In this case, the nodes on the inner cylinder surface usually have much larger incremental
displacements at each increment.

Introduction
In the design of ball joints for automotive applications, the major design concern is to prevent sealing boots from leaking.
Because most ball joint failures occur as a result of corrosion, contamination or dirt ingress, causing excessive wear.
Figure 13-1 shows some typical ball joint failure modes. In practice the stud of a ball joint is subjected to axial, oscillatory
and rotational loads. Currently, most designs of sealing boots are based on design engineer&amp;rsquo;s experience, experimental tests,
and/or much more simplified FEA models. In this example, we will install the boot using a 2-D axisymmetric FEA model
whereby the boot is fitted onto the housing under the large clamp, and then the stud and knuckle moved to fit the boot
onto the shaft. The deformed profile of the boot is then compared to the actual boot.Boundary conditions Housing moves to seat clamp 1; stud and knuckle move to seat clamp 2.

Solution Requirements
MSC Nastran is used to model the assembly process of the boot onto the housing and stud. Since the stiffness of the
housing, ball stud, knuckle and clamping rings is much higher than the rubber sealing boot, they are modeled with rigid
bodies. The simulation is performed as three different cases as explained below:
FEM Solutions
The numerical solution has been obtained with MSC Nastran&amp;rsquo;s solution sequence SOL 400. The details of finite element
models, contact simulations, material, load, boundary conditions, and solution procedure are discussed next.
Finite Element Models
An axisymmetric model of the Ball Joint rubber boot is used in the simulation. The rubber boot is meshed with 845 lower-
order axisymmetric solid elements.
The bulk data file entries defining the axisymmetric properties of the CQUADX  elements are on the PLPLANE  and PSHLN2&lt;br&gt;
asfollows:

PSHLN2,1,1Cases A and B: The rubber-sealing boot material is modeled using Mooney-Rivlin (Case A) and Ogden (Case B)
material models and equivalent performance of both is studied.
Case C: Viscoelastic Relaxation follows the installation with Mooney as the material mode. A time dependence
of hyperelastic properties is taken into account where the viscoelasticity is represented as linear
perturbations over hyperelastic material capable of representing large strains. The viscoelastic
relaxation will drop the strain energy density by about 50% in a two hour time period.

Contact Models
The model has six contact bodies. The rubber boot is the deformable contact body while the housing, ball stud, knuckle,
ring small and ring large are represented as the rigid contact bodies. Each of the contact bodies is defined through the
BCBODY  bulk data entry. Each rigid body is defined to contact the deformable rubber boot, and hence, six contact pairs are
defined through BCTABLE . In each contact pair, the contacting rigid body is defined as PRIMARY  and the deformable rubber
boot is defined as SECNDRY . The contact tolerance is zero and the bias factor is globally defined for all contact pairs as 0.95.
For simplicity, no friction has been included in the analysis. The BCPARA  bulk data entry is used to define the global bias
factor.

Cases A and B:
The experimental data is fitted with a one term Mooney (commonly known as neo-Hookean) model. To demonstrate the
equivalence and accuracy of the implemented elastomer models in sol 400, both Mooney (Case A) and Ogden (Case B)
models have been used for the rubber boot. The models are made equivalent by ensuring that the bulk modulus is the same
for both models and taking care of the following:
µ1 = 2C10 and 1 = 2 and µ2 = 2C01 and 2 = -2
It is important to note that this equivalence relation holds only one way i.e. any neo-Hookean or Mooney model can be
represented by the Ogden model in general but not vice-versa. The bulk data entry used to define the material properties
in Case A is MATHE  for both Mooney and Ogden models. The properties of Mooney and Ogden materials have been input
as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

In this case, along with the Mooney properties of Case A, a MATVE bulk data file entry is used to define the viscoelastic
properties. Here, Wdi (multiplier or scale factor for deviatoric behavior in Prony series) and Tdi (time constant for

Loading and Boundary Conditions
All the rigid bodies are load controlled and are assembled using displacement boundary conditions.
Cases A and B:
The control node 977 of the housing is given an x-displacement of 0.00273451 in the first load case. The control node
976 of the stud is held fixed in the y-direction in the first load case and given a y -displacement of 0.0031074 in the second
load case. The control node 978 of knuckle is held stationary in the first load case and given a displacement -0.0105098
in the second load case. The clamping rings, ring large with control node 974, ring small with control node 975 are held
stationary in the y-direction throughout the analysis but are allowed to translate in the x-direction.
Case C:
All the control node displacements are applied together in the first load step (as explained in the above case) which is
followed by a step of visco-elastic relaxation.
Solution Procedure
The assembly process for the different cases has been done as follows:
Cases A and B:
In the first step, the housing is brought into place with the ball stud and knuckle held unassembled. A fixed time
stepping procedure using NLSTEP  with 50 increments is used to assemble the knuckle. UPV residual checking is
used with KSTEP = -1  and the solution algorithm utilizes the full Newton-Raphson ( PFNT ) with convergence
check using the infinity norm (as opposed to the L-2 norm):&lt;/p&gt;

In the second step, both the stud and the knuckle are brought into position with the housing held in place. Again,
a fixed time stepping procedure using NLSTEP  with 50 increments is used to assemble the Knuckle. UPV
convergence checking is used with KSTEP = -1 .
Large displacement ( PARAM, LGDISP , 2)
Large Strain analysis with updated Lagrangian approach with multiplicative decomposition of deformation
gradient ( NLMOPTS ,LRGS,2 )
Case C:
In this case, all three housing, knuckle, and stud are brought into place in the first load step. Here, the entire analysis is
done in real time. The first load step is of 2 seconds.Again, a fixed time stepping is used with 100 increments with each
increment representing a real time of 0.02 seconds. Again the convergence technique is PFNT  and UPV convergence
checking is used with KSTEP = -1 . The NLSTEP  entry is as follows
NLSTEP   1        2.0
general  25      1     10
fixed   100      0
mech    UPV      .01     .01
In the second load step, there are no additional loads or boundary conditions applied and the system is held in place
through the contact conditions. The assembled system thus relaxes for the next 7200 seconds. This is easily accomplished
with the adaptive time stepping scheme activated using the NLSTEP  entry. The ADAPT  field is employed in the NLSTEP&lt;br&gt;
entry to achieve this. While options like PV convergence test method and PFNT  technique with KSTEP=-1  and
convergence tolerance of 0.100 are specified in the MECH  option of the NLSTEP  entry, the ADAPT  option is used which
specifies the following:
Initial time step (=1.0e-3)
Minimum time step as a fraction of total load step time (=1.0E-5)
Maximum time step as a fraction of total load step time (=.10)
Desired number of iterations (=10)
Factor for increasing the time steps (=1.20)
Output flag (=-1)
Maximum number of increments in the current load case (=999999)
Flag for damping (=0)
Damping co-efficient (=.100E-03)
The NLSTEP  entry is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

Results
The installation of the boot onto the housing and stud is shown in Figure 13-3. The deformed shape is overlaid onto the
actual deformed boot geometry to validate the modeling techniques.
Figure 13-3  Undeformed and Deformed Rubber Boot
As expected, the knuckle force is identical for both the models as shown in Figure 13-4. In addition, the results agree with
Marc&amp;rsquo;s results which have been taken as reference. Figure 13-5 shows the fall of the knuckle force due to the subsequent
relaxation associated with the viscoelastic effects. The fall is quite dramatic and consistent with the material data. Also, it
can be noticed that the SOL 400 solution is very close to the Marc reference results.Undeformed Deformed

New Contact User Interface
It must be noticed that additional laboratory tests (and corresponding curve fitting to get the Prony coefficients) would
need to be carried out to get the time dependence of the material properties. The need for the addition of time dependent
effects in an analysis requires judgment. In analyses involving both rolling resistance (important for designing for fuel
efficiency) or standing waves (tire blowout) in tires, viscous effects are important,; however, a simple static loading to
capture load-deflection curves does not require modeling of any time dependent effects. This can save time and money to
do the additional tests.
In general, adaptive load stepping is recommended to provide robust automatic control of the applied load even in the
presence of strong nonlinearities. In this case, however, the large amount of contact throughout loadcase one together with
the time-dependent aspects of loadcase two made fixed stepping the better option.
New Contact User Interface
MSC Nastran version 2013.1 provides an improved contact user interface so that the input requires less data for large
models, is better organized, and is more readable.
A set of new Bulk Data entries is introduced to replace the existing BCTABLE and BCBODY entries. The contact
parameters can be shared by all contact bodies. As a result, duplicate specifications or a tremendous number of continuation
lines can be avoided. The existing BCTABLE and BCBODY entries are still supported to ensure upper compatibility, but
the old format cannot mix with the new format within the same model.
The following fourteen new Bulk Data entries are implemented.
BCTABL1: Defines a Contact Table (New Form).
BCONECT: Defines the Touching and Touched Contact Bodies.
BCONPRG: Geometric Contact Parameters of Touching Bodies.
BCONPRP: Physical Contact Parameters of Touching Bodies.
BCBODY1: Flexible or Rigid Contact Body in 2D and 3D (New Form).
BCBDPRP: Contact Body Parameters.
BCRIGID: Defines a Rigid Contact Body.
BCRGSRF: Rigid Contact Body Surface List.
BCPATCH: Defines a Rigid Contact Body Made up of Quadrilateral Patches.
BCBZIER: Defines a Rigid Contact Body Made up of Bezier Surfaces.
BCNURB2: Defines a 2D Rigid Contact Body Made up of NURBS.
BCNURBS: Defines a Rigid Contact Body Made up of NURBS.
BCTRIM: Defines the Geometry of Trimming Curves.
BCGM700: Defines a Geometrical Contact Body in SOL 700.
To demonstrate the improvements in concision and organization by the new user interface, the original Case A model
nug_13a.dat is converted into an input file nug_13an.dat using new BCTABL1 and BCBODY1 entries. For comparison,
the original BCTABLE entries are listed as follows.
BCTABLE  0                         6&lt;/p&gt;
