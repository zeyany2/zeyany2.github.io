Introduction
This book is one in a series of user’s guides describing the use of MSC Nastran. The first book in the series,
Getting Started with MSC Nastran User’s Guide , is intended for those readers who are unfamiliar with the finite
element method, those who have never run MSC Nastran, or those who are interested in a general overview
of MSC Nastran’s capabilities. It is assumed that you are familiar with the material in Getting Started with MSC
Nastran User’s Guide  and have MSC Nastran available.
All important features and concepts in this book are illustrated with examples. As you read this guide, it is
highly recommended that you run the example problems and make variations of these problems. When
learning a new MSC Nastran feature, engineers all too often generate a large problem using several hundred
or several thousand degrees of freedom as a test case. This practice has become the norm in recent years with
the advent of graphics preprocessors and automatic meshing. Rarely is such a large model necessary to learn
a new feature; in most cases, it just adds unnecessary complexity. For this reason most of the examples in this
book are small&amp;ndash;generally less than 100 degrees of freedom. T o facilitate the use of these example problems,
example problems referenced in this guide are delivered with MSC Nastran system under the
MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat with the extensions of “.dat”. It is recommended you copy any example
problem to your local directory, so you can see the files created and you don’t inadvertently create files in the
delivery directory.
Problem sizes and computer resources have both been expanding rapidly over the years since NASTRAN was
initially developed. What was large in the 1960’s is tiny today. While the discussions in this guide of large
problems, cpu, storage usage and restart capabilities may imply thousands of degrees of freedom, the reality
of MSC Nastran today is 100’s of million dof problems are possible. The discussions are still valid, just the
scale has changed.
To keep this user’s guide to a reasonable size, complete descriptions of all the MSC Nastran Bulk Data entries
and Case Control commands have not been included. A brief description of the input format is given for
entries and commands when it is helpful to understand the material. You should consult the MSC Nastran Quick
Reference Guide  for detailed descriptions of MSC Nastran input formats, many have direct links.
This guide contains many highlighted links (in blue) to other MSC Nastran documents and all the
documents were delivered together as a collection. If you keep the collection together the links between
documents will work. T wo suggestions when working with links are 1) “ alt “returns you back in the
window your mouse is in and 2) you can open the other “linked to” document in a new window from an
Adobe Reader by choosing Edit Preferences  DocumentsOpen cross-document links in the same
window; then you would uncheck the and select “OK”.
Scope
The main topic of this user’s guide is linear static analysis. The goal is to provide material relevant to this
subject in such a manner that this book can be used both as a learning tool and as a reference text.
Introduction  (Ch. 1) discusses the Finite Element Method and shows a sample analysis. The following seven
chapters will take you through choices and formats for building and loading a model.
Organization of MSC Nastran Files  (Ch. 2) discusses the input and output files and sections of a MSC Nastran
analysis through the use of small sample problems.&lt;/p&gt;

MSC Nastran Elements
Main Index
GENEL  Element
The GENEL element is really not an element in the same sense as the CBAR or CQUAD4 element.  There
are no properties explicitly defined and no data recovery is performed.  The GENEL element is, however,
very useful when you want to include in your model a substructure that is difficult to model using the
standard elements.  The GENEL element is used to describe a substructure that has an arbitrary number of
connection grid points or scalar points.  The input data entered for the GENEL element may be derived from
a hand calculation, another computer model, or actual test data.
There are two approaches that you may use to define the properties of a GENEL element:  (1) the stiffness
approach, in which case you define the stiffness for the element; and (2) the flexibility approach, in which
case you define the flexibility matrix for the element.
1.The stiffness approach:
2.The flexibility approach:

GENEL Element184
Main Index
The forms shown above for both the stiffness and flexibility approaches assume that the element is a free body
whose rigid body motions are defined by {ui}= [S] {ud}.
The required input is the redundant displacement set {ui} list and the lower triangular portion of [K] or [Z]
(note: [Z] = [ K]-1).  Additional input may include the determinant {ud} list and [S].  If [S] is input, {ud}
must also be input.
If {ud} is input but [S] i s omitted, [S] is internally calculated.  In this case, {ud} must contain six and only
six degrees of freedom (translation or rotation, no scalar points).  If the {ud} set contains exactly six degrees
of freedom, then the [S] m atrix computed internally describes the rigid motion at {ui} due to unit values of
the components of {ud}.
When the [S] m atrix is omitted, the data describing the element is in the form of a stiffness matrix (or
flexibility matrix) for a redundant subset of the connected degrees of freedom, that is, all of the degrees of
freedom over and above those required to express the rigid body motion of the element.  In this case, extreme
precision is not required because only the redundant subset is input, not the entire stiffness matrix.  Using
exactly six degrees of freedom in the {ud} set and avoiding the [S] m atrix is easier and is therefore
recommended.  An example of defining a GENEL element without entering an [S] is presented later.
The format of the Bulk Data entry GENEL  in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide  is as follows:

For an example of the GENEL element, consider the robotic arm shown in Figure 4-58.  The arm consists of
three simple bar members with a complex joint connecting members 1 and 2.  For the problem at hand,
suppose that the goal is not to perform a stress analysis of the joint but rather to compute the deflection of
the end where the force is acting.  You can make a detailed model of the joint, but it will take a fair amount
of time and the results will still be questionable.  The ideal choice is to take the joint to the test lab and
perform a static load test and use those results directly.
Figure 4-58  Robotic Arm with Joint
The GENEL element is the ideal tool for this job.  The joint is tested in the test lab by constraining one end
of the joint and applying six separate loads to the other end as shown in Figure 4-59.Field Contents

The flexibility matrix generated from the test data was properly aligned with the model geometry with the
use of a local coordinate (note the CD field of grid points 2 and 3).  Using this local coordinate system, the
output displacement X-axis corresponds to the F1 direction, etc.
Direct Matrix Input, 484  provides you with an alternative approach of inputting structure matrices using the
DMIG entries.
Connector Elements
Introduction
MSC Nastran offers various ways of modeling structural connections and fasteners.  Spot welds, seam welds,
bolts, screws, and so on can be represented, depending on the modeling goals, either with flexible springs or
bars ( CBUSH, CBAR), rigid elements ( RBAR,RJOINT, RBE2, RBE3), or multipoint constraints ( MPC).&lt;br&gt;
Though general, these elements are sometimes difficult to use; singularities may be introduced particularly
in the out-of-plane rotational direction for shells, rigid body invariance may not be assured, and data
preparation and input can be a formidable task in real-world applications.  Increasing mesh refinement can
also introduce further stiffness errors; point-to-point connections in which effective cross-sectional areas are
larger than 20% of the characteristic element lengths can often lead to significant underestimation of
connector stiffness.
The Connector elements address and solve such modeling issues.  Connections can be established with ease
between points, elements, patches, seam lines, dissimilar meshes, or any of their combinations. The&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Linear Statics Analysis User’s Guide
Connector Elements188
Main Index
connector elements are general in purpose, easy to generate and always satisfies the condition of rigid body
invariance.
The CWELD, CFAST and CSEAM elements all have a number of connectivity options. For each of these
elements and their property entries (PWELD, PFAST and PSEAM) plus the SWLDPRM entry of
parameters; the Quick Reference Guide should be reviewed for a complete description of the entry and use.
CWELD Element
Connections can either be established conventionally, from point-to-point, or in a more advanced fashion
between elements and/or patches of grid points.  In the case of elements and patches, actual weld attachment
points will usually occur within element domains or patches and will be computed automatically, with
corresponding automatic creation of necessary grid points and degrees-of-freedom.  Element- and patch-
based connections, moreover, eliminate the need for congruent meshes.  Reference grids that determine spot
weld spacing, for example, can be defined beforehand which, when projected through the surfaces to be
attached, uniquely determine the weld elements’ location and geometry. CWELD element connectivity is
defined using the Bulk Data entry CWELD  in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide . Defines a weld or
fastener connecting two surface patches or points. Large displacement and large rotational effects are
supported when using MSC Nastran SOL 400. The following is a brief description of the various CWELD
connectivity options:
CWELD
Format PARTPAT:
Property-to-Property
PARTPAT , the user defines shell A and B by property id PSIDA and PSIDB. With PARTPAT, all
shell elements (up to 3x3)are connected which fall into the cross sectional area of the spot weld.
Format ELPAT:
Element-to-Element
ELPAT , where SHIDA and SHIDB are element ids of shell A and B, respectively. With ELPAT, the
connectivity is extended to all neighboring shell elements (up to 3x3) which fall into the cross

In the following example, two cylindrical shell segments are connected with 4 CWELD elements at the 4
corners of the overlapping sections, see Figure 4-60. The results of the patch-to-patch connection (see
MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/cweld101b.dat) are compared to the results of the point-to-point connection.
For the patch-to-patch connection (see MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/cweld101a.dat), we place the four
CWELD elements on the corner shells of the overlapping area. For the point-to-point connection, we take
the inner vertex points of the corner shells. The deflection at grid point 64 for the patch-to-patch connection
is lower (stiffer) than from the point-to-point connection (1.8842 versus 1.9233). The difference is
significant in this example because of the coarse mesh and because the connection of the two shells is modeled
with only 4 welds. In most practical problems, the patch-to-patch connection produces stiffer results than the
point-to-point connection. Output results from the CWELD are formatted the same as the CBEAM.

CFAST Element
The CFAST element defines a fastener with material orientation connecting two surface patches. This
extends weld element capabilities by adding a flexible, user-defined connection between either two surface
patches or two shell elements. The PFAST entry gives the option of specifying longitudinal and rotational
stiffness, a lumped mass, and damping along a defined orientation. The format for the CFAST  Bulk Data entry
is as follows:

The format for the PFAST  Bulk Data entry is as follows:

Parameters for CFAST
These two parameters enable you to randomly remove a percentage of CFAST elements for failure studies.
Example
An example is two 3x3 structures made up of 9 cquad4 elements each laid over each other and connected
with a single CFAST element located at the center of each structure.
The diameter of the fastener was chosen so that the fastener would pick up 4 different elements for patch A
and four different elements for patch B. Thus for this weld, a total of 32 different grids are involved in the
connector.

&lt;p&gt;Figure 4-62  Displacement Output of CFAST Element
Example of Projected Grids
The displacements of the projected grids GA and GB for CWELD elements with GRIDID, ELEMID,
ELPAT or PARTPAT format and for CFAST elements are computed to display the relationship between
these elements and their connecting shell elements. If GA or GB is not specified for CFAST elements or
CWELD elements with ELPAT or PARTPAT option, the program will create a grid internally, with the grid
ID number starting from OSWPPT+1 (OSWPPT is a parameter specified by PARAM Bulk Data entry).
The user may request a positive PRTSW parameter (1, 2, 11, or 12) in SWLDPRM Bulk Data entry to view
the grid ID of GA or GB in the diagnostic output.
The displacements of GA and GB are requested using the CONNECTOR  keyword of the DISPLACEMENT
Case Control command. The output is integrated with the displacements of the general grid points.
This example demonstrates the various displacement output requests and their results for a small model with
two CWELD elements.

CSEAM Element
CSEAM is a connector elements which defines a seam line to connect two surface patches. T o define the seam
weld, you must select two surface patches by their property IDs and specify the width and the thickness of
the seam. You also have to specify start point “GS” and end point “GE” of the seam segment. These two
points do not have to lie on or in between the shell planes. The program will project these two points onto
the selected surface patches to find the connecting shell grids.
The CSEAM element provides the following key features:
A seam line is considered continuous between two CSEAM elements that have a common face
based on either common GS/GE points or XYZ coordinates. Note that the SMLN label on a
CSEAM element does not determine the definition of a seam line. It is only intended for ease of
seam line visualization.0                                                                                        SUBCASE 1

This element can connect up to 64 shell grids, which allows the connection of higher order shell
elements.
Besides selecting the connected surface patches by property IDs, the user may define the connection
by specifying shell element IDs directly.
Each of the eight auxiliary points must have a projection onto the connected shell element. This
requirement prevents the generation of ill conditioned stiffness matrix in down stream processing.
The user can model tailored blank tapering by specifying different property IDs at the start and end
points.
This element type supports the MAT9 anisotropic material properties.

CINTC Element
Line interface element is used to connect dissimilar meshes along the edges of finite element mesh
subdomains. These subdomains have boundaries usually associated with either two-dimensional shell
elements or one dimensional beam elements. A set of MPC (Multipoint Constraint) equations are internally
generated with the interface boundary grids to enforce the compatibility of displacements and rotations
across the interface.
There are perhaps three situations in which finite element analysts want to use the interface element
technique to connect two or more independently meshed regions. They are :
Different groups of engineers work almost independently in building finite element models.
Global-local modeling is used in the analysis, where a fine mesh is required in a particular area due
to high stress gradients while the rest of area only needs a coarse mesh, in consideration of the
balance of computing resources and the solution accuracy.
Some regions of a structural model need constant changes or modifications, while the rest of
structure needs little or no change.
An interface element is equivalent to a glued or tied contact that connects the dissimilar meshes.
CINTC is the element connection entry which specifies the connectivity of line interface boundaries,
represented by the GMBNDC Bulk Data entry.
The format for the Bulk Data entry CINTC  in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide is as follows:

MSC Nastran Cohesive Elements
Introduction
MSC Nastran has a library of interface elements, which can be used to simulate the onset and progress of
delamination in SOL 400, and to simulate glue lines in linear analysis. These elements are defined with the
CIFHEX, CIFPENT, CIFQDX (only in SOL 400), and CIFQUAD bulk data entries. The constitutive
behavior of these elements is expressed in terms of tractions versus relative displacements between the top
and bottom edge/surface of the elements ( Figure 4-67).
Figure 4-67  3-D linear interface element
Considering a 3-D interface element, the relative displacement components are given by one normal and
two shear components, expressed with respect to the local element system:
Based on the relative displacement components, the effective opening displacement is defined as:
The effective traction t is introduced as a function of the effective opening displacement. There are three
standard functions available in SOL 400 (refer Cohesive Zone Modeling (MCOHE)  (Ch. 10) in the Nonlinear
User’s Guide . In linear solution sequences, the relative displacements are proportional to tractions, the pro -
portionality constants (in-plane stiffness and normal stiffness) being input by the user.

Benefits
This is a major modeling advantage. Cohesive zone modeling is used to model fracture and fragmentation
processes in various materials. These types of elements are often used in say a crash analysis. The same model
is then used in standard linear analysis, such as linear static analysis or frequency response analysis. By
allowing the cohesive elements to remain “elastically” active in the model removes the requirement of major
modeling changes in the model for linear analysis.
Another application, directly in standard linear analysis, is modeling of glue lines. Alternative use of cohesive
contact (glued contact with normal and tangential stiffness) needs additional meshing effort to delineate the
elements in the contact surfaces of the two contact bodies for the course of the glued line which run curved
and irregularly through the middle of the contact bodies.
Since cohesive elements can have (in fact, usually have) zero thickness, they can be inserted in models without
any difficulty such as need for remesh. Or, existing elements can be easily converted into cohesive elements
as they share the same topology with regular elements.
User Interface
The Cohesive elements available in MSC Nastran utilize the PCOHE property entry and the MCOHE
material entry. T o utilize these elements in MSC Nastran linear analysis, the MCOHE entry includes a value
of -2 in field MODEL for user supplied linear properties (ET - Stiffness in the plane of the cohesive element
and EN – Stiffness normal to the plane of the cohesive element).

Limitations, Guidelines and Notes:
1.For frequency analysis, complex stresses/strains are output only in SORT2 format.
2.When running SOL400-equivalent linear analysis involving ANALYSIS=MODES or MFREQ for
models with membrane only cohesive elements, PARAM, AUTOSPC, YES should be added as it is
not a default in SOL400.
3.Current MSC Nastran cohesive element does not have mass or damping.
4.In linear solution sequences, cohesive element supplies linear stiffness only; it does not supply
differential stiffness or linear thermal load contributions.
5.The associated property and material entries (PCOHE/MCOHE entries) associated with the
CIFHEX, CIFPENT and CIFQUAD elements do not provide for material frequency dependency
6.Currently the MSC Nastran Advanced cohesive does not support transfer moment to associated shell
elements, that is, Tied_Shell_Edge_to_Surface is not considered.
7.Element stress and strain results are output in Element Coordinate System.&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction to Material Properties
MSC Nastran supports isotropic, orthotropic and anisotropic materials.  All of the examples up to this point
have involved isotropic material properties only.  The purpose of this chapter is to describe all of the material
property types that are available to you for linear static analysis.
The material definitions discussed in this chapter include:
Isotropic materials (MAT1 entry) &amp;ndash; An isotropic material property is defined as a material having
the same properties in each direction.  This material may be used with all MSC Nastran linear
elements.
Two-dimensional anisotropic material  (MAT2 entry) &amp;ndash; Material definition for the plate and shell
elements.  The in-plane material properties are defined with respect to an element material
coordinate system.  Transverse shear material properties may be included.
Axisymmetric  solid orthotropic material (MAT3) &amp;ndash; A three-dimensional material property for
axisymmetric analysis only.
Two-dimensional  orthotropic material  (MAT8) &amp;ndash; Defines an orthotropic material property for plate
and shell elements.  Transverse shear material properties may also be included.
Three-dimensional  anisotropic material  (MAT9) &amp;ndash; Defines an anisotropic material property of solid
elements.  The MAT9 entry may also be used to define a three-dimensional orthotropic material.
Also presented in this chapter is the use of the composite analysis in MSC Nastran.  For two-dimensional
analysis involving composite material properties, two options are available. The first method is to use the
PSHELL entry directly with the appropriate material definitions and geometric parameters.  This method is
sufficient for simple composites; however, for most composites, determining the appropriate material
definitions is a tedious process.  The second method available to you is the PCOMP/PCOMPG entry.  The
input on the PCOMP/PCOMPG entry consists of the layer-by-layer material definition.  MSC Nastran
computes the equivalent PSHELL entries for you.  An additional benefit of the PCOMP/PCOMPG entry
is the ability to obtain individual layer stresses and strains, inter-laminar stress, and failure indices.
For three-dimensional composite analyses, you must develop the anisotropic material matrix yourself.  This
material matrix is typically entered using the MAT9 entry.
Examples are presented in this chapter showing the use of the PCOMP/PCOMPG entry and the MAT9
entry for composite analysis.
Isotropic Material (MAT1 )
The isotropic material, defined by the MAT1 entry, is the most commonly used material property.  An
isotropic material is defined as a material that has the same material properties in any direction.  Furthermore,
the isotropic material is fully described by only two material constants.  These two constants may be any
combination of E, G, and .  You may specify all three of these constants if desired, but remember, it only
takes two of the constants to define the material.  When you enter only two constants, the third is computed
from the following relationship:
(5-1)
GE
21+&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash; =&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;203 CHAPTER 5
Material Properties and Composites
Main Index
If you enter all three constants and they do not satisfy this relationship, all three constants are used, but that
may not be your intention.  Therefore, a warning message is printed indicating that the isotropic relationship
has been violated.  It is recommended that you only input two of the three constants.  For line elements, E
is the modulus of elasticity, and G is the shear modulus for torsion and transverse shear if it is present in the
element.  For plate and solid elements, E, G, and  are used to develop a material matrix for the element.
The MAT1 entry may also be used to define the mass density, coefficient of thermal expansion, and stress
limits.  The mass properties are only required in static analysis when a gravity loading or rotating force is
used; however, they are useful for model checkout with any loading condition (of course, they are very
important for dynamic analysis).  The format of the Bulk Data entry MATBV  in the MSC Nastran Quick
Reference Guide is as follows:
MAT1
Note that GE shown in field 9 was not described. The GE is a material damping that has no significance for
static analysis. Information regarding material damping can be found in the MSC Nastran Dynamic Analysis
User’s Guide .
Two-Dimensional Anisotropic Material  (MAT2 )
The MAT2 entry is used to specify a general anisotropic two-dimensional stress-strain relationship of the
form shown in Equation (5-2) and Equation (5-3).  The MAT2 entry can only be used with plate and shell
elements.  The reference temperature is given by TREF and the thermal expansion coefficients are A1, A2,
and A3.  The component directions X and Y refer to the element material coordinate system, which is
explicitly defined for each element.  The material coordinate system for the CQUAD4 element is shown in
Figure 4-42.  The in-plane stress-strain relationship is described by Equation (5-2). Equation (5-3) defines the
transverse shear stress-transverse shear strain relationship.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

coordinate system ( x, , z).  You can only use the MAT3 with the axisymmetric CTRIAX6  element.  The

A sample of the tube material has been tested, and the material properties are determined in the longitudinal
(Xmat) and transverse (Ymat) directions.  The material properties are shown in Table 5-1.
The input file is shown in Listing 5-1.  Normally you would not make a model this coarse for production
purposes, but the small number of elements is useful for demonstration purposes.  The geometry has been
defined with a local cylindrical coordinate system for convenience.  This does not affect the orientation of
the material coordinate system.
The finite element model for the tube is shown in Figure 5-2.  Element 8 is highlighted to demonstrate how
the material coordinate system is used.  The material coordinate system is oriented at an angle of 135 degrees
(field 8 of the CQUAD4 entry).  The 135 degrees is with respect to a line drawn from G1 (which has a grid
ID of 110) to G2 (which has a grid ID of 114).  The resulting material coordinate system is therefore the
same as that shown in Figure 5-1.  The finite element model is shown in Figure 5-2.  The lower plot in Figure 5-2
is the deformed shape.  It is interesting to note that the tube rotates about the z-axis even though a uniform Table 5-1  Composite Tube Material Properties

When you use the MAT9 entry, it is advisable to define a material coordinate system on the PSOLID entry
(using field 4).  For solid elements, stresses are output in the material coordinate system, which by default, is
the basic coordinate system.  In general, for solid elements, it is not easy to determine the orientation of the
element coordinate system.
If you want to use the MAT9 entry to define an orthotropic material, the terms of the material matrix can
be generated by using Equation (5-9):

Three-Dimensional Anisotropic Material (MAT9)212
Main Index
The following example illustrates the use of the anisotropic material  property using the MAT9  material entry.&lt;br&gt;
This example consists of three parts as follows:
1.Develop a material property matrix using a pseudo-anisotropic model consisting of a single CHEXA
element with some bars along the edges and across the diagonals.
2.Verify that the material matrix developed in part 1 is correct.
3.Use the material matrix in a distorted element.
This three-part approach is analogous to constructing an anisotropic material test coupon and then testing
that coupon in the test lab to obtain a strain matrix.  From the strain matrix you develop the material matrix.&lt;br&gt;
Then you verify the material matrix by modeling the test coupon.  Finally, you use the newly developed
material matrix in the actual structure.&lt;br&gt;
Part 1 &amp;ndash; Develop the Material Matrix
To simulate a three-dimensional anisotropic material, a single CHEXA  element is used with bars of various
cross-sectional areas and bending stiffnesses along the edges and across the diagonals as shown in Figure 5-3(a).&lt;br&gt;
The cross sections of the bars are not important, but if you are interested in the actual dimensions, refer to
the input file “anis1.dat” located on the delivery media.  (See MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/anis1.dat) The
dimensions of the cube are 111 inches.  T o constrain the cube, one of the corner grid points is fixed in all
six component directions.
Six self-equilibrating load cases are used to represent each of the six stress components. Each direction was
applied as a separate subcase.  A self-equilibrating normal load consists of applying equal and opposite forces
to opposite faces of the cube (i.e., forces F1, F2, and F3).  For the shear load, a self-equilibrating load consists
of applying four forces around the cube in order to place the cube in a state of pure shear. Note that for all
self-equilibrating load cases, the net resultant should be zero; hence, the SPC force should also be zero.&lt;br&gt;
Because of the dimensions chosen for CHEXA, each load case represents a unit stress, and the resulting strains
are the strains due to unit stress.G34=G35 = G36 = 0.0
G45=G46 = G56 = 0.0&lt;/p&gt;

Figure 5-3  Pseudo-Anisotropic Model
The strains at the center of the CHEXA were extracted from the output file and summarized in Table 5-2.
Table 5-2 represents a strain matrix that, when inverted, is the material matrix [G] introduced in Equation
(5-8).  Note that since the strain matrix is symmetric, the material matrix [G] is also symmetric.
The result is the material matrix [G] for our anisotropic material as shown in Equation (5-10).Table 5-2  Strains Due to Unit Loads on Pseudo Anisotropic Model

Part 2 &amp;ndash; Verify the Material Matrix
Now that the material matrix has been generated, the next step is to verify that the matrix is entered on the
MAT9 entry correctly.  To do this, we return to the 111 inch cube, but this time the analysis will not include
the CBAR entries.  The same six load cases are applied as in Part 1.&lt;br&gt;
If the material matrix is correct, the strains produced should be numerically the same as those shown in
Table 5-2.
The input file for the verification model is shown in Listing 5-2. (See MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/anis2.dat)

In the input file, the six loads are applied separately, each with their own subcase.  The constraints are applied
to three separate grid points and are non-redundant.  The non-redundant constraint set allows the element
to expand in all directions without imposing any constraint forces.  However, rigid body modes are
constrained, which is a requirement for static analysis.  The last item to note is the use of the basic coordinate
system for the material definition.
The resulting center strains for the verification model are shown in Figure 5-4.  As can be seen, there is good
agreement compared to the strain matrix shown in Table 5-2.G10.676.916.891.250.09– 0.86

same MAT1  identification for MID1  and MID2 , and leave the MID3  and MID4  fields blank.  The purpose
of this section is to describe the use of the material fields if your plate structure is not isotropic.
The PSHELL entry is used to define the properties of the plate elements.  With the PSHELL element, you
have several options available, providing you with a versatile tool for modeling a wide variety of applications.&lt;br&gt;
With the appropriate selection of plate thickness, material properties, and bending and transverse shear
parameters, you can model practically any plate you can imagine.
The format of the Bulk Data entry PSHELL  in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide is as follows:
PSHELL
On the PSHELL entry, there are four material ID fields available as shown in Table 5-3.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

The Composite Element (PCOMP or PCOMPG)218
Main Index
If you wish to include membranes only, use MID1 only.  If you wish to include bending only, use MID2 and
optionally MID3.  When MID3 is used, thick plate theory (which includes the transverse shear flexibility) is
used to develop the element stiffness matrix.  In general, for thin or curved surfaces, it is advisable not to use
MID3.
The material type used for any of the material fields (MID1, MID2, MID3, or MID4) may be MAT1,
MAT2, or MAT8.  The PCOMP/PCOMPG entry, which is the subject of the next section, provides a
convenient way of entering appropriate material properties for a plate consisting of layers of unidirectional
fibers.
The MID4 field on the PSHELL entry is used to input a coupling relationship between the in-plane forces
and bending moments.  This coupling only occurs in plates that are nonsymmetric about the neutral plane
or where the neutral plane is offset from the grid points.  Typical applications include reinforced skins and
aluminum bonded to fiberglass.  The MID4 field should be left blank if the element cross section is
symmetric.
The Composite Element  (PCOMP  or PCOMPG )
MSC Nastran provides a property definition specifically for performing composite analysis.  You specify the
material properties and orientation for each of the layers and MSC Nastran produces the equivalent PSHELL&lt;br&gt;
and MAT2  entries.  Additional stress and strain output is generated for each layer and between the layers.

An alternative to the PCOMP entry is the PCOMPG entry. The PCOMPG entry includes a global ply ID,
so it is easier to track the output for the same ply across the model. The format for the Bulk Data entry

Remark:
1.The global ply identification number should be unique with respect to other plies in the entry. The
plies are defined in stacking sequence starting with the bottom layer.
Additional properties can be entered on the PSHLN1  entry for use in SOL 400 STATICS.
A two-dimensional composite material is defined as a stacked group of laminae arranged to form a flat or
curved plate or shell.  Each lamina may be considered as a group of unidirectional fibers.  The principal
material axes for the lamina are parallel and perpendicular to the fiber directions.  The principal directions
are referred to as “longitudinal” or the 1-direction of the fiber and as “transverse” or the 2-direction for the
perpendicular direction (matrix direction).
A laminate is a stack of these individual lamina arranged with the principal directions of each lamina oriented
in a particular direction as shown in Figure 5-7.“SMEAR” All plies must be specified, stacking sequence is ignored MID1=MID2 on
the derived PSHELL entry and MID3, MID4 and TS/T and 12I/T**3
terms are set to zero).
“SMCORE” All plies must be specified, with the last ply specifying core properties and
the previous plies specifying face sheet properties. The stiffness matrix is
computed by placing half the face sheet thicknesses above the core and the
other half below with the result that the laminate is symmetric about the
mid-plane of the core. Stacking sequence is ignored in calculating the face
sheet stiffness.

bottom layer. The bottom layer is defined as the surface with the largest -Z value in the
element coordinate system. (Real; Default =0.0)

Figure 5-7  Laminae Arranged to Form a Laminate
The laminae are bonded together with a thin layer of bonding material that is considered to be of zero
thickness.  Each lamina  can be modeled as an isotropic material  (MAT1), two-dimensional anisotropic
material  (MAT2), or orthotropic material  (MAT8).  The assumptions inherent in the lamination theory are
as follows:
Each lamina is in a state of plane stress.
The bonding is perfect.
Two-dimensional plate theory can be used.
Using the material properties for each of the lamina, equivalent PSHELL and MAT2 entries are generated
as shown in Figure 5-8.Xmat1

Figure 5-8  Equivalent PSHELL and MAT2 Entries Are Generated
The output you may request for a composite analysis includes:
Stresses and strains for the equivalent plate.
Force resultants.
Stresses and/or strains in the individual laminate including approximate interlaminar shear stresses
in the bonding material output.
A failure index table .
If you want stress and/or the failure indices for the composite elements, ELSTRESS  must be requested in the
Case Control Section for the appropriate elements.  Also, if you want the failure index table, you must enter
the stress limits for each lamina on the appropriate material entry, the shear stress limit Sb, and the failure
theory method FT on the PCOMP/PCOMPG entries.
As shown in Figure 5-8, each PCOMP/PCOMPG (together with the material entries for each lamina) is
processed to form an equivalent PSHELL and four MAT2 entries. T o print the equivalent PSHELL and
MAT2 entries in the output file, use NASTRAN PRTPCOMP (361) =1 provided that ECHO=NONE is not set.&lt;br&gt;
If you wish to use them for future runs, they may be punched to an ASCII file. If you are using the equivalent
properties in a future analysis instead of using the PCOMP/PCOMPG entries and you are entering a thermal
coefficient of expansion, do not change the ID numbers.  Also, if you use the equivalent PSHELL and
MAT2s, you will not be able to obtain the laminae stress or the failure index table.  For the failure index, you CQUAD4

strain theory.
As an example of the PCOMPG entry, consider the cantilevered honeycomb plate  shown in Figure 5-9.
Although the honeycomb structure is not considered a composite layup, it can be analyzed effectively using
the PCOMPG entry. The top GPLYID will be 103, center 102 and the bottom 101.
Figure 5-9  Honeycomb Cantilever Plate
The material properties of the honeycomb section are given in Table 5-4.  Note that the face sheets are not of
the same thickness. The result is a nonsymmetric plate, see Figure 5-10, which can be noted by the MAT2
entry for the MID4 field of the equivalent PSHELL.

Part of the input file for the honeycomb plate is shown in Listing 5-4 (See
MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/pcomp1.dat). The load on the plate is a 4000-pound uniform load acting in
the plane of the plate. Using the PCOMPG entry and the GPRSORT (Case)  Case Control command, sorted
output of composite ply results can be printed. The output requests include the element force, laminae stress,
laminae strain, and failure index table for both element 4 and element 4’s plys by GPLYID.
A selected portion of the output is shown in Figure 5-10. If PCOMP’s had been used the ply IDs would have
printed as “1,2,3”.

The Composite Element (PCOMP or PCOMPG)226
Main Index
The plate results indicate that the plates are bending downward due to the axial load, which is expected from
a nonsymmetric cross section.  The laminae stresses show the face sheets to be highly stressed and the core to
have virtually no stress.  The failure index table shows the failure for each laminae and the bonding material
to be less than 1, indicating that the structure will not fail.  As a word of caution, since each lamina is assumed
to be in a state of plane stress, the failure index does not take into account the crushing of the core.
Another example using the PCOMP  entry, consider the model shown in Figure 5-11.
Figure 5-12 shows an example of the data entries required to define a five layer composite material.  A typical
element in the model is magnified to illustrate the individual layers.  The grid points 101, 102, 103, and 104
are used for illustrative purposes.  Also included in the figure are the Bulk Data entries needed to model the
composite material.&lt;/p&gt;

In the previous example, the direction of the x-axis of the material coordinate system (xm) is defined by the
projection of the x-axis of coordinate system 5 onto the element. Using this technique, the direction of
material coordinate system is independent of the shape of the element. The material direction of all the
elements in the model can be defined by referencing a single coordinate system. The MCID  field on the
CQUAD4 Bulk Data entry defines the ID of this coordinate system. The coordinate system is shown in the
figure as the x5-, y5-, z5- axis and is defined on the CORD2R Bulk Data entry. The x-axis of the material
coordinate system can also be defined with an angle. If the THETA or MCID field on the CQUAD4 Bulk
Data entry is an integer, then the value is taken as a coordinate system. If it is real, then the value is taken as
an angle. The presence of a decimal point makes the value real.
The z-axis (zm) of the material coordinate system is in the direction of the z-axis of the element coordinate
system (ze). The direction of the y-axis (ym) follows the right-hand rule.
The CQUAD4 entry references the PCOMP entry, which defines the following layup:
The composite material is made of 5 plies. Ply number 1 is at the most negative zm. Note that since zm is in
the direction of ze, the element grid point connectivity order determines which is the top and bottom surface
of the composite and thus, the stacking direction. Ply angle 0 is in the direction of xm. The positive sense of
the ply angle is in the direction from xm to ym. The PCOMP entry references the MAT8 data entries by the
MID field.
The example uses three different materials. Note that strain allowables are specified on the MAT8 entry.  In
order to let MSC Nastran know that these values are strain allowable, the STRN field must be set equal to
1.0. Material 1 is typical of a graphite epoxy tape. A tape has continuous fibers that all point in the same
direction. Note that E1 is ten times the value of E2. Material 2 is also a tape. Material 3 is a cloth since E1
equals E2. A cloth made of woven fibers has approximately the same number of fibers going in the 1 direction
as in the 2 direction.Ply Material Thickness Angle

Directions 1 and 2 refer to the ply coordinate system . The ply material properties on the MAT8 entry are in
the ply coordinate system. The 1-axis of the ply coordinate system is in the direction of the ply angle. The
3-axis is in the direction of zm (or ze). The 2-axis follows the right-hand rule. Ply results are output in the ply
coordinate system.
Equivalent  Composite Honeycomb Section
If you are only interested in the overall behavior of the honeycomb composite section, then an equivalent
PSHELL /MAT2  or PSHELL/MAT1 combination can be used to model the PCOMP /MAT8  or
PCOMPG/MAT8 effect. This representation yields the correct equivalent stiffness and, consequently, the
correct displacements. However, the stresses in general are meaningless since the information regarding the
individual layers are not available to MSC Nastran when using the PSHELL/MATi combination.  If stresses
are desired, use the PCOMP/MAT8 combination. This process is illustrated by the following example.
The goal of this example is to model the honeycomb section shown in Figure 5-13 using PSHELL/MAT1.&lt;br&gt;
The assumptions are that the membrane and bending loads are carried by the facesheets and the transverse
shear loads are carried by the honeycomb  core. The cross section consists of two 0.01 in thick aluminum
facesheets sandwiching a 0.75 in thick honeycomb core. The properties of the section are shown in
Figure 5-14.

Figure 5-14  Calculation of the Equivalent Properties
The transverse shear moduli (G13 and G23) are different in the two transverse directions, which is typical of
honeycomb  core.  Since the MAT1 entry only allows a single shear modulus, an average Gcore is used. A more
accurate representation of the G13 and G23 is to use the MAT2 entry instead of the MAT1 entry.&lt;br&gt;
As a comparison of PCOMP/MAT8 (see MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat pcomp2.dat) and PSHELL/MAT1
(see MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/pshell2.dat) methods, the abridged output files in Figure 5-15 and
Figure 5-16 show the displacements calculated by using the PSHELL/MAT1 combination are comparable
with the displacements obtained using the PCOMP/MAT8 combination.I 2y2A 2.382.01 2.888103– = = =

Introduction to Constraints
As discussed in this chapter, performing a static analysis requires that all rigid body displacements be removed
prior to solving the static equilibrium equations.  This process involves specifying the appropriate boundary
conditions for your model.  Boundary conditions  are imposed in the form of constraints on selected degrees
of freedom on the model.  Typically, several degrees of freedom (at least six) are constrained to ground using
either SPC Bulk Data entries or the PS field of the GRID entry.
Besides single-point constraints, MSC Nastran provides a method of creating linear constraint relationships
between several degrees of freedom known as multiple-point constraints  or MPC s. This chapter discusses
both the single-point and multiple-point constraints.
The emphasis in this chapter is on applications, not on how the constraints are processed.  If you want to
understand how constraints are processed, you need to be familiar with the MSC Nastran set notation and
matrix operations (set notation is discussed in Matrix Operations .  However, this level of understanding is not
necessary for the majority of the applications.
Single-Point Constraints  (SPC, SPC1)
A Single- Point Constraint (SPC) is a constraint that is applied to a single degree of freedom, which may be
either a component of motion at a grid point or the displacement of a scalar point.
The primary applications for single-point constraints are as follows:
1.To tie a structure to ground.
2.To apply symmetric  or antisymmetric boundary conditions by restraining the degrees of freedom that
must have a zero value to satisfy symmetry or antisymmetry. Symmetry is discussed in Modeling
Guidelines .
3.To remove degrees of freedom that are not used in the structural analysis (i.e., are not connected to
any structural elements or otherwise joined to the structure).
4.To remove degrees of freedom that are very weakly coupled to the structure. This condition can
occur, for example, to the rotations about the normal of a slightly curved shell. In this case, a
judgment must be made whether to remove the degree of freedom using an SPC (in which case the
structure may be over-constrained), or to leave it in the problem (in which case the stiffness matrix is
nearly singular).  A reasonable rule is to constrain the degree of freedom if its stiffness is less than 10-
8 as large as the stiffness in another direction at the same grid point.
Under certain circumstances, AUTOSPC causes an SPC to be applied automatically to components of
motion with zero or very small stiffness.  This feature is discussed in Automatic Application of Single-Point
Constraints (AUTOSPC) .
When you apply a single-point constraint to remove a singularity, it is not required for the restrained
component of motion to be aligned exactly with the singular direction of motion (however, it is highly
recommended). Consider the pair of colinear pin-connected rods, shown in Figure 6-1, that permit
unrestrained motion at point G in any direction perpendicular to the axis of the rods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;235 CHAPTER 6
Constraints
Main Index
Figure 6-1  Pin-Connected Rods
After SPCs are applied to the translation in the z-direction and to all three components of rotation,
unrestrained motion is still possible in the n-direction. An SPC in either the x- or the y-direction removes
the remaining singularity without disturbing the axial forces in the rods (in this special case). Note, however,
that the motion at point G has a zero component in the restrained direction, which may produce incorrect
results for the displacements. For this reason, it is recommended that a local coordinate system be selected
with the coordinate axes aligned with the singular components of motion. An example of this is shown in
Enforced Displacements at Grid Points (SPCD, SPC) .
The SPC and SPC1 Bulk Data entries are recommended if you need to apply different sets of boundary
conditions in different subcases. The constraints specified on the SPC and SPC1 entries belong to sets
identified by set identification numbers (SIDs) that must be selected in the Case Control Section to be
used.As a further convenience, the sets can be merged into combined sets by the SPCADD Bulk Data entry,
which can be specified in the Case Control Section.
The format of the Bulk Data entry SPC in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide is as follows:

SPC1
The SPC entry can also be used to specify a nonzero displacement constraint.  The values specified in fields
5 and 8 are enforced displacements for the components specified in fields 4 and 7, respectively.  When using
an enforced constraint within multiple subcases, it is more efficient to use the SPCD  entry.
As an alternative, single-point constraints may be applied directly on the GRID and GRDSET  Bulk Data
entries.  These SPCs are permanent, i.e., they are not selectable in the Case Control Section.  Their primary
use, in addition to applying permanent supports, is to remove unconnected or very weakly connected degrees
of freedom.  Such degrees of freedom can also be constrained automatically using AUTOSPC, which is
described in Automatic Application of Single-Point Constraints (AUTOSPC) .
Automatic Application of Single-Point Constraints
(AUTOSPC )
Degrees of freedom that are either unconnected or very weakly coupled to the finite element model can be
removed automatically with the PARAM, AUTOSPC ,YES in Bulk Data or the Case Control command AUTOSPC
(Case)  in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide .  In Solution 101, the Grid Point Singularity Processor
(GPSP) module is invoked to identify potential singularities. AUTOSPC defaults to YES, GPSP constrains
the degrees of freedom associated with the obvious singularities.  GPSP identifies local singularities in the
stiffness matrix after processing all of the SPC  and MPC  constraints in your model (this is different for
Solution 24).
The identification of local grid point singularities begins with the examination of the 33 matrices
representing the three translations and three rotations of each grid point.  For each 33 matrix, an
eigensolution is performed to obtain the principal values (eigenvalues ) and the principal directions
(eigenvectors).  The principal values are normalized to obtain a measure Ri as shown in Equation (6-1):

where:
Any principal value for which  &amp;lt; EPZERO represents a singularity.  The principal direction
corresponding to the singularity is examined, and the component with the largest ratio is identified as the
failed direction for the grid point.  Any degrees of freedom that you specify as belonging to the a-set are not
constrained ( a-sets are discussed in Matrix Operations ).
Always review the Grid Point Singularity Table  to ensure that the degrees of freedom that are automatically
constrained are the degrees of freedom that you intend to constrain.  There are two potential problems that
can occur by not verifying the AUTOSPC constrained degrees of freedom in your model.  One possible
problem is when a grid point or components of a grid point are inadvertently left unattached in your model
when you wanted them to be attached.  The GPSP module identifies singular degrees of freedom and
constrains them.  It may hide a modeling error, and unless you reviewed the grid point singularity table, you
may not know it.  A common example of a modeling error that is hidden by the GPSP  module is forgetting
to specify bending stiffness (via MID2 on the PSHELL entry).
The second reason you need to review the Grid Point Singularity Table is to ensure that the constrained
degrees of freedom make sense.  It is possible that the GPSP module can constrain a degree of freedom that
may result in wrong answers.
The output includes a grid point singularity table with the following format:
1.The TYPE specifies whether the failed degree of freedom is a component of a grid point, which is
indicated by a “G”, or that of a scalar point, which is indicated by an “S”.
2.The component of motion that failed.  Constraints are applied in the global coordinate direction
closest to the weakest direction as defined above.
3.The threshold at which the DOFs are constrained may be changed using the parameter EPZERO .
4.The stiffness ratio is the ratio of the stiffness in the weakest direction to the stiffness in the strongest
direction at the grid point (considering all possible directions rather than just the coordinate
directions).  Translational and rotational stiffness are considered separately.  The default value for the
failure criterion is 10-8, which may be changed by PARAM,EPZERO.
5.If possible, the failed degrees of freedom are placed in the sb-set if AUTOSPC  is set to YES (the

The CBAR element is fully constrained at end A and is loaded with a 100 N force in the Yb-direction at end
B.  The input file for this model is shown in Listing 6-1.  (See MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/bar3a.dat) Both
grid points are defined in the basic coordinate system (the CP  field for both grid points is blank).  The
displacement coordinate system for grid point 1 is the basic system, but the displacement coordinate system
for grid point 2 is in the local coordinate system 1.  It is typical to define a local coordinate system when you
need a displacement component in a specific direction.

ENDDATA
For this example, the displacement should be exclusively in the Yb-direction.  Since the displacement is
computed and output in the CD coordinate system , you expect that the displacement components T2 (the
Y1-direction) and T3 (the Z1-direction) for grid point 2 are the same for this model.  The displacement and
force results shown in Figure 6-3 confirm this assumption.
Figure 6-3  Force and Displacement at Grid Point 2 with a Nonzero I2
However, suppose that when you construct the model, you know that the deflection is in plane 1 of the
element only, so you leave the I2 field blank.  (See MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/bar36.dat) The resulting
grid point singularity table, element forces, and displacements are shown in Figure 6-4.
Figure 6-4  Force and Displacement at Grid Point 2 with a Zero I2
As can be seen, the GPSP module identified a singularity that is caused by the missing bending stiffness of
the element.  However, the constraint is placed on the Y1 and y1 the  degrees of freedom, not the Y1 and
yb degrees of freedom.  The force in the CBAR element is correct, but the displacements are wrong.  You
made a common assumption that for a symmetric structure with in-plane loads, the out-of-plane properties
are not needed.  However, the choice of the output coordinate system and parameter AUTOSPC resulted in
a modeling error.  If you chose the output coordinate system for grid point 2 as the basic system, the
displacements would be correct.  Also, for this model, if parameter AUTOSPC is set to NO, the job will fail.G R I D   P O I N T   S I N G U L A R I T Y   T A B L E

Enforced Displacements at Grid Points (SPCD, SPC)240
Main Index
If this had been a production size model, the error would not have been so obvious and may well have gone
undetected.  Always look at the Grid Point Singularity Table results to make sure that the constrained degrees
of freedom are acceptable.
Enforced Displacements  at Grid Points (SPCD , SPC )
There are two methods available to you for specifying an enforced displacement at a component.  The first
method is to enter the value of the enforced displacement directly on an SPC entry.
The alternate method to enforce a displacement at a component is to use the SPCD Bulk Data entry.  The
SPCD entry is actually a force, not a constraint, but it is used in conjunction with an SPC entry to enforce
the displacement.  When you use an SPCD entry, internal forces are computed that are applied to the
structure to produce the desired enforced displacements.
The format of the Bulk Data entry SPCD in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide is as follows:
SPCD
Grid points with an enforced displacement using the SPCD entry must also appear on an SPC or an SPC1
Bulk Data entry.
The SPCD method of enforcing a nonzero constraint is more efficient than using an SPC entry alone when
you are using multiple subcases that specify different constraint conditions.  Note also that when you use an
SPCD entry, the displacement values entered on the SPC entry are ignored-only the SPCD values are used.
The SPC/SPCD combination is more efficient then SPC only to use when the magnitudes but not the
locations of the constraints change.  The larger improvement seen by the magnitude only change is reasonable
because only one SPC needs to be processed; the multiple boundary conditions  are represented as multiple
loads.  In general, whenever you have multiple subcases with different constraint conditions, the SPC/SPCD
combination is the preferred method for efficiency.
As mentioned previously, the SPCD is a force entry, not a constraint.  Therefore, the SPCD is selected in the
Case Control Section with the LOAD  command.
If the SPCD entry is the only loading in the model, a warning message is issued alerting you to the fact that
no loading is specified for your model.  If you intended for the SPCD entry to be the only loading condition,
you may safely ignore this warning message.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Multipoint Constraints (MPC)
In MSC Nastran, the term Multiple-P oint Constraint  (MPC ) is used to describe an imposed linear
relationship between two or more degrees of freedom that are expressed in the form
(6-2)
where:
Multipoint constraints have many important practical applications and can be used to
Define the relative motion between two grid points as a degree of freedom.
Define the average of several motions as a degree of freedom.
Supply hinges or sliding joints between parts of a structure.
Join dissimilar elements, for example, to join elements with rotational degrees of freedom to
elements that have only translational degrees of freedom (e.g., to join shell elements to solid
elements).
Obtain the resultant of forces on a structure or on part of a structure.
Distribute a force to several points in a structure.  This is particularly useful if the force is an
unknown force, for example, the force required to compress a fluid.
Join elements with noncoincident grid points, for example, to change mesh size within a structure.
Replace extremely stiff structural members with rigid connections. This modeling technique should
only be used when necessary to improve the numerical conditioning of the stiffness matrix.  MPCs
can be used for this application, but they are not recommended.  The preferred method is to use an
R-type element because this element is simpler, and therefore less prone to error.  R-type elements&lt;br&gt;
are discussed in R-Type Constraint Elements .
Define a component of motion at a grid point that is not aligned with the axes of the global (i.e.,
local) coordinate system, for example, to enable the user to supply a constraint in such a direction
with an additional SPC  entry.
The format of the Bulk Data entry MPC in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide is as follows:

Multipoint Constraints (MPC)242
Main Index
As an illustration of the use of the MPC entry, consider the following example.
Consider the model shown in Figure 6-5.  The goal is to determine the relative motion between component 1
of grid point 1 and component 1 of grid point 2 using an MPC entry and a scalar point.
Figure 6-5  Using an MPC to Compute Relative Displacement
Let the components of motion at the two grid points whose difference is desired be designated as x1 and as
x2 given by Equation (6-3).  The difference is represented by scalar point 3 defined on an SPOINT entry.
x3 = x2 - x1(6-3)
The equation of constraint can be in any of the forms shown in Equation (6-4).
(6-4)
Listing 6-2 shows the implementation of Equation (6-4)(a) to obtain the relative displacement.  (See
MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/reldiff.dat) The first degree of freedom on the MPC entry is the dependent
degree of freedom-which in this case is scalar point 3.  It can just as well be made a component of motion at
a grid point defined on a GRID entry.  Grid points 1 and 2 are the independent degrees of freedom.  Note
that the MPC set ID (SID) is selected in the Case Control Section.
The first listed degree of freedom on the MPC entry (i.e., x3 in this example) is designated as dependent and
is placed in the m-set .  The degrees of freedom in the m-set are eliminated at an early stage in the solution
process.  If you want the relative motion to appear as an independent degree of freedom, express the
multipoint constraint in either the second or third forms of Equation (6-4).Field Contents

ENDDATA
The MPCY bulk data entry may be used to specify a nonhomogenour constraint.
There are three important rules that must be observed when using MPCs (or R-type elements).  These rules
are as follows:
1.A member of the m-set  cannot be a member of any exclusive subset of the g-set, for example, it cannot
be a degree of freedom that is removed by single-point constraints.  MSC Nastran displacement sets
are discussed in Matrix Operations .
2.A given degree of freedom cannot be designated as a member of the m-set (dependent) more than
once.  Thus, it cannot appear as the first listed component on more than one MPC entry.
3.You must avoid redundant constraints.  This redundancy occurs, for example, if two of the forms in
Equation (6-4) are supplied simultaneously on MPC entries.  The technical difficulty that occurs is that
the matrix of constraint coefficients for the m-set is singular so that the dependent degrees of freedom
cannot be evaluated in terms of the independent ones.  This problem also occurs when R-type
elements are interconnected in a closed loop.
An important aspect of multipoint constraints is that they simultaneously supply relationships between
components of motion as well as relationships between the forces of constraint.  This can be demonstrated
by using the principle that the forces acting on a rigid body can do no work.  Consider, for example, the
equation of constraint among three degrees of freedom shown in Equation (6-5).
R1u1 + R2u2 + R3u3 = 0 (6-5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Linear Statics Analysis User’s Guide
Nonhomogeneous Multipoint Constraint (MPCY, MPCD)244
Main Index
The work done by the corresponding forces of constraint is given by Equation (6-6).
W = 1/2(F1u1 + F1u2 + F3u3) = 0 (6-6)
In order for both Equation (6-5) and Equation (6-6) to be valid, it is necessary that the following equation also
be valid.
(6-7)
Thus, the forces of constraint are proportional to the coefficients in the equations of constraint. As an
example, consider the use of a constraint to evaluate the average of four motions, i.e.,
u5 = 1/4(u1 + u2 + u3 + u4) (6-8)
From Equation (6-8), the forces of constraint are given by:
F1 = F2 = F3 = F4 = 1/4F5 (6-9)
It is clear, from Equation (6-9), that a force applied to u5 is distributed equally to u1, u2, u3, and u4.
In general, any constraint can be viewed either as a means to constrain a component of displacement or as a
means to distribute the net force acting on the constrained component of displacement (i.e., the resultant of
applied force and internal forces).
Nonhomogeneous Multipoint Constraint (MPCY, MPCD)
With MPC’s, if a nonhomogeneous multipoint constraint was desired, then the method of “SLACK” variable
was required. That is, the nonhomogeneous right hand side of the MPC equation was written using a scalar
or grid point, with an SPC or SPCD specifying the right hand side value. With an MPCY Bulk Data entry
the right hand side value is entered directly into the MPC equation. The entry defines an equation of the form
See the description of the MPC Bulk Data entry in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide  for a description
of the terms on the left hand side of the preceding equation.
The Bulk Data entry MPCY  in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide is used to define a nonhomogeneous
multipoint constraint directly. This entry can also be used to define a standard homogenous multipoint
constraint.

As a simple example, consider a horizontal rod structure. The left and right ends are clamped. However, as
Listing 6-3 shows (see MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/mpcy.dat), there is a break in the structure of 0.1 units
of length. If the grid point ID at the left end of the break is A, and the grid point ID at the right end of the
break is B, we can tie the structure by the MPC equation
UB - UA = 0.1
In the example, we show how to write the MPC equation in two ways. The first way uses the standard

Introduction to Static Loads
This chapter describes the static loads available when performing a linear static analysis. Each of the load types
discussed may be applied to your structure individually or in any combination.
FORCE  and MOMENT  entries &amp;ndash; Concentrated forces and moments, which are applied directly to
a grid point. The direction and magnitude is defined by entering the components of a vector.
FORCE1  and MOMENT1  entries &amp;ndash; Concentrated forces and moments, which are applied directly
to a grid point. The direction of the load is defined by a line joining two grid points.
FORCE2  and MOMENT2  entries &amp;ndash; Concentrated forces and moments, which are applied directly
to a grid point. The direction of the load is determined by a cross product of two vectors that are
defined using four grid points.
PLOAD1  entry &amp;ndash; A distributed load applied to a line element (e.g., CBAR, CBEAM or CBEND).
PLOAD  entry &amp;ndash; Defines a pressure load applied to a surface in terms of three or four grid points.
PLOAD2  entry &amp;ndash; Defines a pressure load applied to a two-dimensional element (e.g., CQUAD4 ,
CTRIA3 , or CSHEAR)
PLOAD4  entry &amp;ndash; General-purpose pressure and/or traction loads applied to a two-dimensional
element or the surface of a solid element.
GRAV , RFORCE, ACCEL, ACCEL1 entries &amp;ndash; Gravity and rotational static loads.  The forces on
the structure are based on the mass distribution in the model.
DEFORM  entry &amp;ndash; Applies a force that is needed to obtain a specified strain in an element.
A load is applied to the model only if it is specifically called out in the Case Control Section.  Having a load
entry in the Bulk Data Section does not mean that the load will necessarily be applied to the structure.  For
reasons discussed earlier, this provides you with greater versatility. If, however, you forget to request any load
in the Case Control Section, the problem will be solved with zero loads applied. There are no error or warning
messages indicating that there is no load being applied. Forgetting to specify a load request in the Case
Control Section can be a common mistake many new users make. An indication of this problem is when all
of the displacements and stresses come out to be zero.
Loads on Grid Points and Scalar Points
Concentrated forces can be applied directly to the grid points with the FORCE , FORCE1, and FORCE2&lt;br&gt;
entries.  The FORCE entry is the most commonly used entry and is the one used in most of the examples up
to this point.  The Bulk Data entry FORCE  in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide  allows you to specify
the magnitude and direction of a force vector in any coordinate system as shown below.

FORCE SID G CID F N1 N2 N3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;253 CHAPTER 7
Static Loads
Main Index
The magnitude of the applied force is the scale factor, entered in field 5, times the magnitude of the vector
defined in fields 6 through 8.  For example, the force applied with the following two FORCE entries is the
same.
The FORCE1 entry allows you to define a force by specifying a magnitude and two grid points-not
necessarily the loaded grid point-to determine the direction.  The FORCE2 entry specifies a magnitude with
the direction defined by the vector product of two other vectors.  The format of the Bulk Data entries FORCE1&lt;br&gt;
and FORCE2  in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide is as follows:
FORCE1
FORCE2
While the FORCE1 and FORCE2 forms are not used extensively, they are useful for some modeling
situations as shown in the following example.Field Contents

Loads on Grid Points and Scalar Points254
Main Index
Suppose you wish to model a curved structure with edge loads as shown in Figure 7-1.  The edge loads  consist
of 10 N per element (acting normal to the elements) and 8 N per element along the edge of each element
(acting as a shear load).  The FORCE1 and FORCE2 entries are the ideal choice to apply these loads.  You
could use the FORCE entry, but it would be quite a bit more difficult because you would need to compute
the normals for each of the loaded CQUAD4 elements.  Using FORCE1 and FORCE2 entries for the shear
and normal loads , respectively, makes the task much easier.&lt;br&gt;
The 10 N normal force for each element is divided up equally between the two grid points along the edge.&lt;br&gt;
The directions of the resulting 5 N forces are applied using the FORCE2 entry by taking the cross product
of the vectors defined by the edges to which the grid points are attached.  The result is a 5 N load acting
normal to the plate.  The 8 N shear force for each element is also divided up equally between the two grid
points along the edge.  The resulting 4 N loads are applied with the FORCE1 entry.  The directions of these
loads are determined by the line connecting the edge grid points.
Part of the input file is shown in Listing 7-1. (See MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/edge.dat) Note that the
normal forces and the shear forces are applied as one load condition.  If you want the forces to act as separate
loadings, you can use different IDs for the FORCE1 and FORCE2 entries and select them using two separate
subcases.

ENDDATA
Note that two or more loads can be applied at the same grid points.  This is perfectly acceptable, since the
total force acting at the grid points will be the sum of all the applied loads.  The OLOAD  output, requested
through the Case Control Section, shows the applied force resultant acting at a set of user specified grid
points.  The OLOAD output is useful in verifying that the loads are applied correctly.  A partial listing of the
output file showing the OLOAD output is given in Figure 7-2.

MOMENT, MOMENT1 , and MOMENT2  are similar to the three FORCE entries.  The only difference
is that the force entries are used to apply concentrated force in the translational degrees of freedom (T1, T2,
and T3).  The moment entries apply concentrated moments in the rotational degrees of freedom (R1, R2,
and R3).
The SLOAD  entry is used to apply loads to scalar points only-it cannot be used with grid points.&lt;br&gt;
The format of the Bulk Data entry SLOAD  is as follows:
SLOAD
The DAREA entry normally used in dynamics can also be used in statics to create equivalent FORCE,
MOMENT and/or SLOAD entries. This is useful for applying loads at grid points in the displacement (or
local) coordinate system and switching between static and dynamic analyses. The creation of the equivalent
load entries will only happen if there are no LSEQ entries in the Bulk Data section.
The format of the Bulk Data entry DAREA  is as follows:

1.One or two scale factors may be defined on a single entry.

4.In dynamic analysis, DAREA entries may be used with LSEQ Bulk Data entries if LOADSET is
specified in Case Control.  The LSEQ and static load entries will be used to internally generate
DAREA entries.
5.If DAREA is referenced by a GUST entry, Pi must be defined.  However, it is only used if selected
through a DLOAD Case Control command.  WG from the GUST entry is used instead of Ai when
requested via a GUST entry.
6.All DAREA entries corresponding to all grid and scalar points are automatically converted internally
by the program to equivalent FORCE/MOMENT/SLOAD entries (as appropriate) if there are no
LSEQ Bulk Data entries .
7.In superelement analysis, DAREA may be used to specify loads not only on the interior points of the
residual, but also on the interior points of upstream superelements if there are no LSEQ Bulk Data
entries .
8.In static analysis, DAREA entries may be used only if there are no LSEQ Bulk Data entries . They are
ignored if there are any LSEQ Bulk Data entries.
Distributed Loads on Line Elements
PLOAD1
To apply a distributed load to a CBAR , CBEAM , or CBEND  element, you use the PLOAD1  entry.  The
PLOAD1 entry can be used for both concentrated and linearly distributed forces.  For the CBAR and
CBEAM elements, the linearly distributed force may be applied between any two locations on the element
(or off the element if you wish.)  For the CBEND element, the linearly distributed loads are restricted to
linearly varying forces  and moments between the end points.

“LE” (length), the xi values are the actual distances along the element axis, and, if
X1 ≠ X2, then Pi values are the load intensities per unit length of the element.
“FR” (fractional), the xi values are the ratios of the distance along the axis to the total
length, and (if X2 ≠ X1)  Pi values are the load intensities per unit length of the element.
“LEPR” (length projected), the xi values are the actual distances along the element axis,
and (if X2 ≠ X1) the distributed load is input in terms of the projected length of the
element.

Static Loads
Main Index
the concentrated load  will be applied at the X1 location.  If both X1 and X2 are input, the load will be taken
as a linearly varying load between X1 and X2.
There are two ways to define the location of the load on the CBAR and CBEAM elements using  field 5 of
the PLOAD1 entry.  Using the “LE” or “LEPR” methods, you specify the actual start and end positions of
the load as measured from end A of the element.  When using this method, the distances X1 and X2, as
shown in Figure 7-3, are in the same units as the dimensions used for the model.
The second way to define the location of the load is using “FR” or “FRPR”, in which case you specify the
percent (using “X/XB”) along the element where the load starts and ends.  A value of 0.0 defines end A, while
a value of 1.0 defines end B.  Again, the start of the load is measured from end A.
For both methods of describing the location of the loads, you also have the option of specifying whether the
applied load is to be a direct load (scale “LE” and “FR”) or a projected load (scale “LEPR” or “FRPR”).  For
the projected loads , distributed loads are entered in terms of the projected length of the element as shown in
Figure 7-3.  It is important to remember that if the loads are being input in terms of the basic coordinate
system (“FX”, “FY”, “FZ”, “MX”, “MY”, or “MZ”), then the projected angle  is with respect to the basic
coordinate system, not the element coordinate system ( Figure 7-3).  The effect of using projection is illustrated
later with an example.
The first example demonstrating the use of the PLOAD1 entry consists of applying a direct linearly varying
load to the three-bar structure shown in Figure 7-4.

ENDDATA
Note the that the starting location for the linearly varying load starts and ends at 0.3 m (300 mm) and 0.8
m (800 mm), respectively.  This is the distance measured from end A.  One of the most common mistakes is
to make these distances 1.3 m and 1.8 m, respectively, while thinking that it is the actual distance measured
in the basic coordinate system.  It is not; it is the distance measured from end A of the loaded element-in this
case, grid point 2.
When you use the PLOAD1 entry to define a distributed load, you will find the CBARAO  entry very helpful.&lt;br&gt;
The CBARAO  entry is used to request stress and force output at intermediate locations along the CBAR
element.  The CBARAO output for element 2 is shown in Figure 7-5.

The shear and moment diagrams are shown in Figure 7-6.  As you can see, the CBARAO entry is one of the
best tools available for model checkout when using linearly varying loads on the CBAR elements.  There is
no easier way to generate a shear and moment diagram than by using the CBARAO output request.
Figure 7-6  Shear and Moment Diagram Generated from CBARAO Output
For CBEAM elements, intermediate output along the element can be requested directly on the PBEAM
entry.
Another feature of the PLOAD1 entry is the ability to apply projected loads .  T o apply a load as a projected
load, you choose a scale (field 5) of “LEPR” for the actual length from end A or “FRPR” for the fractional
distance from end A.  A typical example of a projected load is that of a snow load on a truss structure as shown

To see the effect of using projected forces, the resulting SPC forces are shown in Figure 7-8.  The total reaction
of the loads obtained by adding the SPC forces is 6500 N in the Y-direction.  The total reaction load  is equal
to the projected length of 13 meters times the distributed load of 500 N/m.  If the projected option had not
been used, the applied load would have been 6964.2 N, which is the total length of the top members times
the distributed load.
Figure 7-8  SPC Forces Due to the Snow Loading
As a final comment on the PLOAD1 entry, if you are using a concentrated load and do not need the
additional features that the CBEAM element offers, you are better off using the CBAR element.  This is due
to the way the equivalent end loads are generated.  For the CBAR element, the equivalent end loads are
generated explicitly.  For the CBEAM element, the end loads are generated by numerical integration along
the length of the element, which may not be as accurate as the method used for the CBAR element.  A linearly
varying load applied with a PLOAD1 entry is accurate when used with either element.
PLOADB3
The Bulk Data entry, PLOADB3  defines a distributed l oad over the entire length of a CBEAM3 element axis.
The load is applied along the line of the shear center.

Distributed Loads  on Surfaces
There are three Bulk Data entries available to apply distributed loads to element surfaces.  The PLOAD  and
PLOAD2  entries are used to apply a distributed load to the CQUAD4 , CTRIA3 , and CSHEAR  elements
only.  The PLOAD4  entry can be used to apply distributed loads on any of the two-dimensional elements
and on the surfaces of three-dimensional elements.
The PLOAD entry is different from the other PLOADi entries because it references three or four grid points
rather than the element itself.  When the PLOAD entry is used to load a CTRIA3 element, then the total
force acting on the element is divided evenly among the three corner points.  When the PLOAD entry is used
to load a CQUAD4 element, the total force acting on the element is distributed to corner grid points using
the geometric shape of the element.  The resultant of the applied corner loads acts through the centroid of
the element.  The direction of the pressure load is determined using the right-hand rule by the numbering
sequence of the grid points on the PLOAD entry.
The format of the Bulk Data entry PLOAD  is as follows:
PLOAD
The format for the Bulk Data entry PLOAD2 is similar to the PLOAD entry except that the PLOAD2
references the element ID instead of the grid points where the element is attached.
The format of Bulk Data entry PLOAD2  is as follows:

The PLOAD2 is usually preferred over the PLOAD entry because it is easier to use.  The PLOAD2 entry,
similar to the PLOAD entry, is limited to pressure acting normal to the element surface.  The direction of
the pressure load is determined by the numbering sequence of the grid points on the connectivity entry
(CQUAD4, CTRIA3, etc.).
The PLOAD4 entry possesses the most general pressure definition.  It can be used to apply pressures and/or
tractions to any of the two-dimensional elements and the surfaces of the three-dimensional elements.  The
PLOAD4 entry can be used for everything that a PLOAD2 entry is used for.  The direction of the pressure
can be set by one of two methods.  By default, the direction of the pressure is determined by the element
normal.  For two-dimensional elements, the direction of positive pressure is in the direction of the outward
normal as is determined by applying the right-hand rule to the ordering sequence of the grid points on the
connectivity entry.  For surfaces of solid elements, the direction of positive pressure is inward toward the
center of the element.  The face of the solid to which you are applying the pressure is determined by
specifying the appropriate corner grid points.

Remarks:
1.In the static solution sequences, the load set ID (SID) is selected by the Case Control command
LOAD. In the dynamic solution sequences, SID must be referenced in the LID field of an LSEQ
entry, which in turn must be selected by the Case Control command LOADSET.
2.The continuation entry is optional. If fields 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the continuation entry are blank, the
load is assumed to be a pressure acting normal to the face. If these fields are not blank, the load acts
in the direction defined in these fields. Note that if CID is a curvilinear coordinate system, the
direction of loading may vary over the surface of the element. The load intensity is the load per  unit
of surface area, not the load per unit of area normal to the direction of loading.
3.For the faces of solid elements, the direction of positive pressure (defaulted continuation) is inward.
For triangular and quadrilateral faces, the load intensity P1 acts at grid point G1 and load intensities
P2, P3, (and P4) act at the other corners in a sequence determined by applying the right -hand rule to
the outward normal.
4.For plate  elements, the direction of positive pressure (defaulted continuation) is in the direction of
positive normal, determined by applying the right -hand rule to the sequence of connected grid points.
The load intensities P1, P2, P3, (and P4) act respectively at corner points G1, G2, G3, (and G4) for
triangular and quadrilateral elements. (See plate connection entries.)P1, P2, P3, P4 Load per unit surface area (pressure) at the corners of the face of the element. (Real or
blank; Default for P2, P3, and P4 is P1.)
G1 Identification number of a grid point connected to a corner of the face. Required data
for solid elements only. (Integer &amp;gt;0 or blank)
G3 Identification number of a grid point connected to a corner diagonally opposite to G1
on the same face of a CHEXA, CPENTA or CPYRAM  element. Required data for
quadrilateral faces of CHEXA, CPENTA and CPYRAM  elements only. For
CPYRAM element triangle faces, G1 and G3 are adjacent corner nodes on the
quadrilateral face, and the load is applied on the triangular face which includes those
grids. G3 must be omitted for a triangular surface on a CPENTA element.
G4 Identification number of the CTETRA grid  point located at the corner; this grid point
may not reside on the face being loaded. This is required data and is used for
CTETRA  elements only. (Integer &amp;gt;0)
CID Coordinate system identification number. See Remark 2. (Integer &amp;gt;0; Default =0)
N1, N2, N3 Components of vector measured in coordinate system defined by CID. Used to define
the direction (but not the magnitude) of the load intensity. See Remark 2. (Real)
SORL The character string SURF or LINE. SURF means the surface load acting on the
surface of the element and LINE means the consistent edge loads acting on the edges
of the element. The default is SURF . See Remark 13.
LDIR Denote the direction of the line load (SORL=LINE), character string X, Y, Z, TANG,
or NORM. The default is NORM. See Remark 14.Field Contents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;267 CHAPTER 7
Static Loads
Main Index
5.If P2, P3, and P4 are blank fields, the load intensity is uniform and equal to P1. P4 has no meaning
for a triangular face and may be left blank in this case.
6.Equivalent grid point loads are computed by linear or bilinear interpolation of load intensity followed
by numerical integration using isoparametric shape functions. Note that a uniform load intensity will
not necessarily result in equal equivalent grid point loads.
7.G1 and G3 are ignored for CTRIA3, CTRIA6, CTRIAR, CQUAD4, CQUAD8, and CQUADR
elements.
8.The alternate format is available only for CTRIA3, CTRIA6, CTRIAR, CQUAD4, CQUAD8, and
CQUADR elements. The continuation entry may be used in the alternate format.
9.For triangular faces of CPENTA elements, G1 is an identification number of a corner grid point that
is on the face being loaded and the G3 or G4 field is left blank. For faces of CTETRA elements, G1
is an identification number of a corner grid point that is on the face being loaded and G4 is an
identification number of the corner grid point that is not on the face being loaded. Since a CTETRA&lt;br&gt;
has only four corner points, this point G4 will be unique and different for each of the four faces of a
CTETRA  element.
10. For the CQUADR and CTRIAR element, only pressure that acts normal to the element is  computed
properly. Surface tractions are not resolved into moments normal to the element.
11. All referenced elements must exist (closed list) for residual only runs and are not required to exist
(open list) for superelement runs; and they cannot be hyperelastic for either.
12. If fields 3 through 5 of the continuation entry are not blank, the load is assumed to have a fixed
direction. If fields 2 through 5 of the continuation entry are left blank, the load is assumed to be a
pressure load. In this case, follower force effects are included in the stiffness in all linear solution
sequences that calculate a differential stiffness. The solution sequences are SOLs 103, 105, 107 to
112, 115 and 116 (see also the parameter FOLLOWK ). In addition, follower force effects are included
in the force balance in the nonlinear static and nonlinear transient dynamic solution sequences, SOLs
106, 129, 153, and 159, if geometric nonlinear effects are turned on with PARAM,LGDISP,1. The
follower force stiffness is included in the nonlinear static solution sequences (SOLs 106 and 153) but
not in the nonlinear transient dynamic solution sequences (SOLs 129 and 159).
13. The SORL field is ignored by all elements except QUADR and TRIAR. For QUADR or TRIAR
only, if SORL=LINE, the consistent edge loads are defined by the PLOAD4 entry. P1, P2, P3 and
P4 are load per unit length at the corner of the element. If all four Ps are given, then the line loads
along all four edges of the element are defined. If any P is blank, then the line loads for only two edges
are defined. For example, if P1 is blank, the line loads of the two edges connecting to G1 are zero. If
two Ps are given, then the line load of the edge connecting to the two grid points is defined. If only
one P is given, the second P value default to the first P value. For example, P1 denotes that the line
load along edge G1 and G2 has the constant value of P1.
14. The direction of the line load (SORL=LINE) is defined by either (CID, N1, N2, N3) or LDIR. Fatal
error will be issued if both methods are given. TANG denotes that the line load is in tangential
direction of the edge, pointing from G1 to G2 if the edge is connecting G1 and G2. NORM denotes
that the line load is in the mean plan, normal to the edge, and pointing outward from the element.
X, Y, or Z denotes the line load is in the X, Y, or Z direction of the element coordinate system. If
both (CID, N1, n2, N3) and LDIR are blank, then the default is LDIR=NORM .&lt;/p&gt;

Distributed Loads on Surfaces268
Main Index
15. For SOL 400, with large displacement (PARAM,LGDISP), higher-order 6-node triangles (CTRIA6),
8-node quadrilateral (CQUAD8), 20-node hexagonal (CHEXA), or 15-node pentahedral
(CPENTA), the load is not calculated correctly. Use lower-order elements if distributed loads are
required in a large displacement analysis .
Alternatively, the direction of the pressure defined by the PLOAD4 entry can be input using an optional
coordinate system and a vector entered on the continuation line. Using a local coordinate system, a pressure
acting at any angle to the surface may be defined. Loads acting parallel to the surface, which are referred to
as tractions, can also be applied.
Another feature unique to the PLOAD4 entry is the ability to apply a nonuniform pressure.  The pressure
may be entered at each of the corner grid points resulting in a linearly varying pressure load.  If the pressure
is entered for the first grid point only, the pressure is assumed to be constant over the element.
Later in the chapter, an example is shown that takes advantage of the optional coordinate system, but first it
is useful to demonstrate the PLOAD4 entry as it is commonly used.
Consider the curved plate shown in Figure 7-9.  PLOAD4 entries are to be used to apply a normal pressure  to
each of the six CQUAD4 elements.
Figure 7-9  Pressure Loads on the CQUAD4s
Part of the input file is shown in Listing 7-4.  (See MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/press.dat) When using the
PLOAD4 entry, you may specify a PLOAD4 entry for every element or use the alternate method of specifying
several elements that have the same pressure.  The alternate method is used for this example.

The resulting deflection is shown in Figure 7-10.  The deflected shape is not what you would expect.  Element
2 appears to bend up.  The problem occurs because the normal for element 2 is reversed (see the ordering of
the grid point IDs on the CQUAD4s).  The pressure on this element is acting upward.  This type of mistake
is quite common.  Model checks to determine reversed normals and other potential modeling errors are
discussed in Model Verification .

Gravity (GRAV)
The GRAV entry is used to define the direction and magnitude of a gravity vector in any user-defined
coordinate system. The components of the gravity vector are multiplied by the mass matrix to obtain the
components of the gravity force at each grid point. Since the mass matrix is used to compute the forces, you&lt;/p&gt;

must have mass in your model, typically defined by the density on a material entry. Note that the GRAV entry
must have a unique SID-no other loading entry may use the same ID. The LOAD entry (discussed in the
next section) can be used to combine gravity loading with other types of loading.
The format of the Bulk Data entry GRAV is as follows:
GRAV
Gravity loading is one the best loadings to use when you are performing model checkout because the force is
applied at every point in the structure that has mass.  If you have modeling errors where elements or grids
points are not attached to the structure, their displacement is unbounded and the job fails.  If this occurs, a
diagnostic message indicating the grid point and component, where the singularity is detected, is printed.
Centrifugal (RFORCE)
The RFORCE entry is used when you need to apply a force to your structure due to rotational velocity and/or
acceleration.  On the RFORCE entry, you input the components of a spin vector that are used internally to
compute centrifugal forces.  Each component of the spin vector is multiplied by the same scale factor.

Remark:
1.The forces that are created with the RFORCE entry act on the structure as follows: the forces that
are defined with the RFORCE entry for a constant angular velocity (A), act in the positive radial
direction. These forces represent the inertia forces on the structure due to a constant angular velocity.
The forces that are defined with the RFORCE entry for a constant angular acceleration (RACC), act
in the same direction as the angular acceleration. These forces would be opposite to the inertia forces
on the structure due to a constant angular acceleration. In Figure 7-11, the force vector at grid point

ZOFFS).  Method=2 yields correct results for lumped or consistent mass matrix only if the ZOFFS option is
not used.  The acceleration terms due to the mass offset (X1, X2, X3) on the CONM2 entry are not
computed with method=2.  All the possible combinations of mass matrices and offset and the correct method
to be used are shown in Table 7-1.
In addition, for problems with elements that have edge grid points (CQUAD8, CTRIA6, CTRlAX6,
CHEXA, CPENTA, CPYRAM  and CTETRA), correct centrifugal loads are produced only if the parameter
PARAM,COUPMASS,x (where x is greater than 1), is included in the input file and Method 2 is used.
Note for PARAM, COUPMASS=-1 (the default) the generation of lumped mass  matrices that contains only
translational components for the elements listed above.  Notable exceptions to this are the CBAR and
CBEAM elements, both of which will yield rotational and coupling terms in order to preserve the mass center
when element offsets are defined.  This offset mass is ‘lumped’ in the sense that it has low matrix rank, and Table 7-1  Restrictions When Using the RFORCE Entry

is ‘coupled’ in the sense that there are non-zero off diagonal terms in the mass matrix.  The CBEAM element
will also yield a mass moment of inertia about the local X axis of the element, and if NASTRAN
BARMASS &amp;gt;0, then this is also true of the CBAR element.
In order to yield a lumped mass matrix containing translational components only for the CBAR and
CBEAM elements, set SYSTEM(414)=1, along with the default value for PARAM,COUPMASS (-1). The
default value (0) for SYSTEM(414) produces the coupled mass matrices for CBAR and CBEAM.
Set Selection of GRAV and RFORCE (GRAVSET, RFORSET)
Above, GRAV and RFORCE loading was described as a global loading condition. However, in certain
application, there is a need to apply these forces only to certain portions of the model and not to the complete
model.
GRAVSET
Default = 0
GRAVSET=n, where n is a Bulk Data SET1 entry, allows the user to apply gravity loading (GRAV) to just
a portion of the structure. GRAVSET like GRAV loading is global and is computed once at the beginning
of the analysis. The Bulk Data SET1 n defines the GRIDS to which the gravity loading is to be applied.
GRAVSET can appear in either the Bulk Data or ABOVE or IN the 1st Subcase. A GRAVSET appearing in
any other Subcase will be ignored and may cause incorrect results. A GRAVSET appearing in or above the
first subcase takes precedence over a GRAVSET appearing in Bulk Data. See also the companion RFORSET
entry.

The housing (blue) is fixed in place while the fan blade (red) rotates via an electric motor.
RFROCE loading applied to the housing will lead to incorrect loading and unrealistic stress in the housing.

Acceleration Loads (ACCEL  and ACCEL1 )
ACCEL  and ACCEL1  Bulk Data entries are used to apply an acceleration load  that varies across the
structure. The ACCEL entries apply acceleration loads which may vary over a region of the structural model.
The load variation is based upon the tabular input defined on this Bulk Data entry. The ACCEL1 entry
applies static acceleration load at individual grid points. Bulk Data entries ACCEL  and ACCEL1  in the MSC
Nastran Quick Reference Guide  are used in the same way as other load entries (such as GRAV, FORCE, and
MOMENT, etc.) through the MSC Nastran Case Control commands.

Defining Mass  (CMASSi and CONMi)
Common ways to define mass are the concentrated masses (CMASSi  and CONMi ), mass density on the
material entries (MAT1, MAT2, etc.), and nonstructural mass defined on the property entries.  The mass
density defined on the material entries is given in terms of mass/unit volume.  You must be sure the mass
unit is consistent with the other units in the model.  For example, in the English system (in, lb, sec), the mass
density of steel is approximately 7.32 10-4 lb-sec2/in4.
The format of the Bulk Data entry CMASS1  is as follows:

PMASS
The format of the Bulk Data entry CONM1 entry is as follows:
CONM1
The other concentrated mass entries are CMASS2 , CMASS3 , CMASS4  and CONM2 .
The nonstructural mass defined on the property entries is mass that is added to the structure in addition to
the structural mass from the elements.  For one-dimensional elements, the units are mass/unit length.  For
two-dimensional and three-dimensional elements, the units are mass/unit area and mass/unit volume,
respectively.
It is often convenient to express the mass in terms of weight units instead of mass units.  This can be
accomplished with the use of the parameter WTMASS .  The function of the WTMASS parameter is to multiply
the assembled mass matrix by the scale factor entered with the WTMASS parameter.  For the steel example, Field Contents

the mass density can be entered as a weight density of 0.283 lb/in3 with a WTMASS parameter of 0.00259
(which is 1/386.4).  As a word of caution:  if you enter any of the mass in terms of weight, you must enter all
the mass in terms of weight. The WTMASS multiplies all of the mass in the model by the same scale factor.&lt;br&gt;
(The mass entered in Direct Matrix Input is an exception and is discussed in Model Verification  and Glossary .)
Consider the two rotating masses shown in Figure 7-12.  The masses are accelerated at constant angular
acceleration of 20 rev/sec2 from 0 to 200 rev/min.  The goal is to determine the axial force in the CBAR as
a function of angular velocity.
Figure 7-12  Rotating Concentrated Masses
The input file is shown in Listing 7-5.  (See MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/rotate.dat) Multiple load cases are
used to determine axial forces at six rotational speeds.  Using multiple load cases for this problem is much
more efficient than submitting separate runs because MSC Nastran does not have to regenerate the stiffness
and mass matrices.  The matrices are generated and decomposed (inverted) just once.  Another interesting
note is that the model really does not rotate; it is actually fixed at the center.  If the constraints permitted the
model to rotate, the run would fail.

ENDDATA
A plot summarizing the axial force is shown in Figure 7-13.  As expected, the graph is not linear because
centrifugal forces are not linear with angular velocity.  It follows, therefore, that using a SUBCOM command
to combine the subcases with RFORCE entries can lead to misleading results.  In other words, the element
axial forces for Subcase 3 cannot be obtained by merely doubling the element axial forces of Subcase 2 by
using a Subcom/ Subseq combination.  This is due to the fact that the axial force is a function of 2, and not
two times .&lt;/p&gt;

Initial Strains  (DEFORM )
MSC Nastran includes a limited capability to apply initial strains.  The DEFORM Bulk Data entry can be
used to apply an enforced extension (units of length) to any line element except the CBEND element.  The
thermal expansion capability can also be used to provide initial strains besides the thermal strain.  This feature
is discussed in Thermal Loads (TEMP and TEMPD) .
The format of the Bulk Data entry DEFORM  is as follows:
DEFORM
When using the DEFORM entry, you must remember that in general you are not enforcing a strain or an
actual extensional length to the element.  What you are doing is applying a force to the element that produces
the specified extension if the element is free to expand without internal forces being generated.  This
computed force is added to the other forces in the model.  Since most elements in your model are not free
to expand, the extension value you specify may not be achieved.  This feature is best illustrated with an
example.

Initial Strains (DEFORM)282
Main Index
Suppose you want to use the DEFORM entry to enforce a strain on the three-member structure shown in
Figure 7-14.  The goal is to impose an initial strain equal to 100 cm/cm in the center member.
Figure 7-14  Three-Bar Structure with Initial Strain
Before solving this problem, we must consider the following items:  (1) the DEFORM entry can only impose
a force, (2) from static equilibrium, if no forces are imposed on grid points 2 and 3, the force in all three
members must be the same.  With this in mind, the following procedure is used.
1.Determine the force required in member 11 that produces the 100 mcm/cm strain.
11 = E = (7.1 × 106)(100 × 10-6) = 710 N/cm2
P = A11 = (1.5)(710) = 1065N
2.Since there are no external forces acting on the elements, the force of 1065 N is same in all the
members.  Using the 1065 N force, the stresses computed in the other members.
11 = P/A10 = 1065/1 = 1065 N/cm2
12 = P/A12 = 1065/2 = 532.5 N/cm2
3.From the stresses found in part 2, the element strains are computed for elements 10 and 12.&lt;br&gt;
Multiplying the strain within each element by its length yields the extensional change of the element.&lt;br&gt;
These extensional changes are the deform values required to produce a 100 cm/cm strain in element
11.

These values are entered on the DEFORM Bulk Data entry as shown in Listing 7-6. (See
MSC_DOC_DIR/doc /linstat/strain.doc) To help understand the implementation of the DEFORM
entry, two configurations are being analyzed.  The first configuration (Subcase 1) specifies the
boundary conditions as shown in Figure 7-15(a).  For this case, the structure is free to expand without
inducing any element forces.  The results of this subcase should be the extension of the members as
entered on the DEFORM entry.  As mentioned previously, a force is applied to the element that
produces the specified extension if the element is free to expand.
The second subcase, shown in Figure 7-15(b), is the constrained configuration that is of interest.  If the
calculations are correct, the strain in the center element should be the required 100 cm/cm.

ENDDATA
The stresses and displacements for the two subcases are shown in Figure 7-16.  As can be seen for the free end
configuration, the extension of all of the members is consistent with the DEFORM entry.
Contrary to your expectations for the fixed end configuration, the extensions for the elements are not the
same as the values entered on the DEFORM entry.  The stress in member 11 is  710 N/cm2.
Since E = 7.1  × 106 , the strain in element 11 is equal to   = E/ = 100 cm/cm s train. The stress output is
requested for this example because strain output is not available for one-dimensional elements.
It is not expected that you will necessarily follow this procedure for an actual structure.  The purpose of the
example is to demonstrate how the DEFORM entry is implemented.  Once you understand how it is
implemented, it can be useful for applying initial strains to your model.&lt;/p&gt;

Alternatively, temperature data can be specified on an element-by-element basis as shown in Table 7-2.
Average temperatures specified directly for an element take precedence over the temperatures interpolated
from the element’s connected grid points. S olid elements obtain their temperatures only by interpolation
from connected grid points.  Note that interpolated grid point temperatures provide temperature gradients
over the neutral surface of shell elements, whereas the TEMPPi entries do not.
The temperature data and the thermal expansion coefficients are used internally to calculate equivalent forces
and moments acting at the grid points.
The TEMPERATURE (Case) (INIT) and TEMPERATURE (Case) (LOAD) Case Control commands specify the initial
temperature and applied temperature, respectively. The TEMP(INIT) command must appear either above
the first subcase or inside the first subcase.

The SUBCOM/SUBSEQ  combination is quite straightforward for mechanical loads, but it takes more effort
when it is used for thermal loads.  The mechanical load case need not be selected in the SUBCOM subcase;
however, for thermal loads they do need to be selected.  Element stresses and forces are calculated on an
element-by-element basis from a knowledge of the displacement vector and the temperature field. Therefore,
in a SUBCOM or a SYMCOM, you must supply a definition of the temperature field whenever element
stresses and/or forces are requested. The TEMP(LOAD) for the subcom is calculated as follows:
(7-2)
where:
The TEMP(LOAD) must be supplied through the standard temperature Bulk Data entries such as TEMPD,
TEMP , etc., and selected in the SUBCOM Case Control Section.  This is best illustrated with part of an
example problem shown in Listing 7-7.

As a further example of thermal loads, again consider the umbrella tent shown in Figure 7-17.  The tent is
subjected to thermal radiation from partial exposure to the sun.  The ground is held at 75 degrees Fahrenheit.&lt;br&gt;
Can the tent withstand the thermal stresses imposed by solar radiation?
This problem involves conduction, convection, and radiation, which is beyond the scope of this user’s guide,
but the stress analysis of the resulting temperature profile is not.  For further discussion on the subject of heat
transfer, refer to the MSC Nastran Thermal Analysis User’s Guide .

To analyze this type of problem, you need to run the heat transfer Solution 153 to produce a temperature
profile for all of the grid points in the model. Part of a Solution 153 input file is shown for this model and
is included on the delivery media with the name ‘heat.dat’.  (See MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/heat.dat)
One of the features of Solution 153 is the option of creating a temperature file that can be included directly
into the solution 101 input file. Part of the Solution 101 input file used for the stress analysis is shown in
Listing 7-8. (See MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/thermal.dat) The temperature file from the Solution 153 run
is shown in Listing 7-9.  Note the use of the INCLUDE  statement, which inserts the temperature input file at that
location when the job is submitted.  See Database Management  for a further discussion of the INCLUDE
statement.

The OLOAD and stress results for this model are shown in Figure 7-18.  The OLOAD output shows the
applied loads generated by the imposed temperature. Of course, the model does not have enough detail to
provide accurate results, but it does illustrate the procedure you can follow to perform a thermal stress
analysis.

Load Combinations
Each applied load entry has a set identification number, SID, which may be the same or different from other
applied load entries.  The purpose of the SID is to allow different loading conditions within the same analysis
without requiring that entries be physically added to or removed from the Bulk Data Section.
Subcases, which may or may not include different loading conditions, are requested in the Case Control
Section.  Three Case Control commands (LOAD , TEMP(LOAD) , and DEFORM ) are used in selecting
loading conditions for subcases.  Each of these commands identifies a unique set whose SID is the same as
the SID of one or more Bulk Data entries.  Figure 7-19 shows the Bulk Data entries that can be selected by
each of the three Case Control commands.
The LOAD Bulk Data entry is used to combine the loads specified on other Bulk Data entries to form new
loading conditions.  Also, as noted in Figure 7-19, the LOAD entry is required if you want to combine gravity
loads with other applied loads, even if there is only one loading condition.  The LOAD entry provides
separate factors for each of the individual load sets and also an overall scale factor.
The format of the Bulk Data entry LOAD is as follows:

Figure 7-20  Umbrella Tent Subjected to Gravity and Wind Loads
Part of the input file containing the combined loading is shown in Listing 7-10.  (See
MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/tent.doc) To apply the wind pressure in the correct direction, a local
coordinate system is defined so that the local Y axis makes an angle of 5 degrees with the ground.  This
coordinate system is referenced on the PLOAD4 continuation entry.  Since all of the elements in the model
are exposed to the wind load, the simplest method is to use the thru option on the PLOAD4 entry (fields 8
and 9).
The gravity load of 386.4 entered on the GRAV  entry corresponds to a 1 G load in the English system.&lt;br&gt;
Whenever you are working with an acceleration vector in terms of Gs, make sure that you convert the load
such that its units are consistent with your structure.

The gravity load is defined by the GRAV entry with a loading set ID of 1.  The wind loading is defined using
the PLOAD4  entry with a loading set ID of 2.  The LOAD entry (ID of 5) is used to combine the gravity
and wind loadings.  The LOAD entry is selected by the LOAD = 5 command in the Case Control Section.&lt;br&gt;
If the GRAV and the PLOAD4 entries were assigned the same ID, a fatal error would have resulted.
Export of Static Loads
Functionality exists in MSC Nastran to facilitate load transfer from one run to the next in three important
ways:
1.MSC Nastran can use Grid Point Force methodology to extract the load on a user defined free body.
This load is output on a PG-like matrix that has an associated NAME, ID and optional label. A
BGPDT data block is also produced that contains information on the grids associated with the free-
body.
2.MSC Nastran can export static loads from a load case defined in the current subcase.&lt;br&gt;
3.MSC Nastran can import a load from a pre-defined database (including, but not limited to, loads
produced using the previous steps) to be used in the formation of the load on a structure.
The design of complex structures frequently involves joint development with a system integrator and a
number of subcontractors. The development of design loads is typically the task of the system integrator
based on an analysis of the entire vehicle. It is then necessary to communicate the loads on the pieces of the
structure to various subcontractors. The ability to extract the load on a free body is particularly useful in
aeroelasticity, where the load can be a combination of applied, rigid aerodynamic and inertial loadings.  The
ability to export the statically applied load, or some portion of the load, is felt to be of benefit when it is
desired to apply the same loading to different representations of the same structure.&lt;br&gt;
The ability to export a statically applied load is enabled by the Case Control command EXPORTLD (Case)  in the
MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide .  Typically, this is applied at the subcase level, but can be applied above
the subcase level as well.  The command results in a unique load vector (qualified by LOADID and
LOADNAME) for each subcase.  If a SET is part of the EXPORTLD command, only the loads on the grids
associated with this grid are exported.  A BGPDT (Basic Grid Point Data Table) is output with the load vector
to identify the degrees of freedom associated with each of the rows in the vector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;295 CHAPTER 7
Static Loads
Main Index
The ability to export a free body load is done through the combination of the FBODYLD (Case)  Case Control
command and the Bulk Data entries FBODYLD  and FBODYSB  in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide .  The
FBODYLD Case Control command is used to point to the FBODYLD Bulk Data (via the NAMEi on the
case control command) that defines the submodel for which the freebody load will be calculated and stored.&lt;br&gt;
The case control command also provides an optional load ID that can be associated with the load.  The
FBODYLD Bulk Data entry, in turn, points to a FBODYSB Bulk Data entry.  The FBODYLD entry
provides a label that is intended to identify the loading condition while the FBODYSB entry has a second
label that is intended to identify the component. Both labels are optional.  The FBODYSB entry identifies
the grids and elements that make up the free body and provides the ability to exclude certain types of grid
point forces in creating the free body load.&lt;br&gt;
The FBODYLD request produces informational messages from a DBDICT statement that requests output
on the presence of all FBLPG and FBLBGPDT data blocks along with qualifiers as to loadid, namei (from
case control and the FBODYLD Bulk Data entry), submodel name from the FBODYSB entry and the labels
from the two bulk data entries.
The remarks for the EXPORTLD Case Control command indicate how the loads created with an
EXPORTLD request can be imported in a subsequent run using FMS statements such as:
ASSIGN loads1=’run1.MASTER’
DBLOCATE datablk=(EXTLD,EXTBGP) WHERE(LOADNAME=’ALLCASES’),&lt;br&gt;
CONVERT(LOADID=LOADID+1000) LOGICAL=loads1
…
CEND
LOADS=1001 $ Select external load with LOADID=1001, imported
from previous run.
The EXTLD datablock contains the loads and the EXTBGP contains the grid point information that is used
to match up the imported loads with the grid points.  Clearly, it is necessary that the Grid ID’s have the same
meaning in the two runs.
The import of a load created using the FBODYLD Case Control command is similar except it is now
necessary to rename the datablocks created in the previous run to match those required for the import of
these loads:
ASSIGN loads1=’fbrun1.MASTER’
DBLOCATE datablk=(FBLPG/EXTLD,FBLBGPDT/EXTBGP)
WHERE(LOADNAME=’fblcase’),  CONVERT(LOADID=LOADID+1000)
LOGICAL=loads1
…
CEND
LOADS=1001 $ Select external load with LOADID=1001, imported
from previous run.
The applied loads are typically excluded when using the FBODYSB Bulk Data entry so that only element
forces remain at the grid points.
Import of loads has the following rules
If a set of imported loads share a common LOADID value, then those loads will implicitly be
added.  The same holds true for imported loads and bulk data load sets that share a common ID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Linear Statics Analysis User’s Guide
Fatigue Analysis/Output Request296
Main Index
To explicitly combine load sets, the load IDs should be made unique. The LOAD Bulk Data entry
can then be used to explicitly define the linear combination.
Both standard exported loads (EXPORTLD) and free body loads (FBODYLD) can be imported
and used together in a single run.  It is up to the user to keep the load IDs unique between them.
The BGPDT is used to link the exported loads to the grids points of the model to which they are
applied.  This means that the grid id’s for the loaded grids must be the same in the two models.
Fatigue Analysis/Output Request
Introduction
Besides stress, engineers question is how long will it last? Fatigue life calculations can often be a tedious post-
processing activity that would take place after the stresses and strains are determined, and done externally to
MSC Nastran. Now users can request fatigue life and damage as an output request similar to requesting
displacements, stresses, strains, and forces.  You can calculate fatigue damage and fatigue life directly within
linear statics SOL 101, modal analysis SOL 103, or modal transient SOL 112 runs for materials that can be
defined with MAT1 bulk data (metal fatigue analysis). A brief description will be give below. For a detailed
description of this capability see MSC Nastran Embedded Fatigue User’s Guide .
Fatigue Description
Fatigue can be described as structural failure under repeated or otherwise varying load, which never reaches
a level sufficient to cause failure in a single application. Typical stress analysis is generally representative of a
single application of a loading environment. Multiple or cyclic applications of the same loading environment
over time can now be simulated to predict fatigue life and damage directly in MSC Nastran.
Fatigue analysis requires three main inputs: geometry, materials, and the cyclic load variations. The geometry
comes from the SOL 101, 103, or 112 runs in the form of stress distributions over the entire model. Special
material properties are used in the form of stress-life (S-N) or strain-life (  -N) curves. The plasticity that
occurs due to the cyclic loading is built into these curves and methods used as look up tables and corrections
to equate linear stress or strain levels (range and mean) to life. The cyclic variations of the loading are defined
in typical table format and are used to scale the stress distribution. Multiple, simultaneously applied loads are
combined using the principle of linear superposition to produce the stress or strain time variations. These
time histories are then processed through a &amp;ldquo;rainflow” cycle count algorithm to determine the range and mean
of each stress/strain cycle. Damage is determined using the tried and true methods of the total life (S-N) or
crack initiation (  -N) to determine fatigue life. Damage from all cycles is summed and reported as life values.
Multiple loading events can be strung together to form a sequence of events, commonly known as a duty
cycle. Damage from each event is summed to give life due to the entire duty cycle.
The following illustrations gives the overall fatigue calculation process.   The first illustrates the process of
taking the FE loads and their time variations to combine them into stress output responses time histories at
various locations of the model. Ultimately this stress variation is turned into a fatigue live prediction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;297 CHAPTER 7
Static Loads
Main Index
The process of converting the time varying stress responses into fatigue life predictions is a two or three step
process depending on the method used. Both the stress-life (S-N) and strain-life ( -N) methods employ a
well known algorithm to extract cycles of stress/strain called rainflow cycle counting. An easy way to
conceptualize this is by mapping the stress time history to the stress-strain space where each hysteresis loop
represents a stress-strain cycle. Each cycle has its specific stress range and mean. Sometimes this is illustrated
in the form of a histogram showing specific discrete bins of stress range vs. mean. In the case of the strain-life
(-N) method, the plasticity correction is then made using techniques such as Neuber&amp;rsquo;s plasticity correction
method, before looking up the damage on an S-N or an -N curve. Both methods may employ mean stress
corrections also. Damage from all such bins is then summed using Palgren-Miner damage summation rule
and fatigue life presented as the reciprocal of damage.&lt;/p&gt;

Fatigue Analysis/Output Request298
Main Index
Overview of Case Control and Bulk Data:
One or more fatigue analyses can be selected using the FATIGUE case control entry. A SET case control entry
is used if more than one analysis is to be requested and is then referenced by the FATIGUE case control entry.
The FATIGUE (Case)  in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide case control entry must appear above all
subcases. This Case Control examples indicates that three separate fatigue analyses are to be performed.
SET 99 = 11, 12, 13
FATIGUE(SET) = 99
Each Set ID selected by a FATIGUE case control entry references a set of bulk data that describe the inputs
necessary for a fatigue analysis. For each fatigue analysis, a set of FTGDEF , FTGPARM, and FTGSEQ bulk
data entries with the same ID need to be defined.
Fatigue Element Definitions (FTGDEF)
The FTGDEF  (FaTiGue element DEFinitions) supplies the analysis with the desired locations on the model
where fatigue damage is to be calculated. If no FTGDEF bulk data exists for the fatigue analysis, all the
elements (solid and shells) are assumed part of the analysis. Individual elements or entire property sets of
elements can be specified.   Individual elements can also be excluded from the analysis. The example below
simply shows that a fatigue analysis is to be performed on element 1 only and that additional properties are
defined using PFTG bulk data with ID 18.
FTGDEF, 11, , 18
, ELSET, 1
Fatigue Parameters (FTGPARM)
The FTGPARM  (FaTiGue PARaMeters) defines fatigue parameters. If no FTGPARM bulk data exists for the
fatigue analysis, defaults are assumed.   The FTGPARM specifically selects which type of fatigue analysis is
to be performed such as an S-N (total life or stress-life) or -N (crack initiation or strain life) analysis. S-N
analysis is the default. Other parameters may also be specified on the FTGPARM to enhance the analysis,
speed it up, request different correction methods, and obtain additional output.   This example simply shows
that a crack initiation analysis is being requested:
FTGPARM, 11, EN, 1.0
Fatigue Load Sequence (FTGSEQ)
The FTGSEQ  (FaTiGue SEQuence) defines the cyclic load variation. This entry is required and if not present,
a fatal error is issued. The FTGSEQ is simple, yet very powerful. It can be used to define a simple oscillating
time variation of -1 to +1 scaling of the load, to very complicated sequences of the loading called a duty cycle.&lt;br&gt;
For a duty cycle, additional bulk data are necessary: FTGEVNT  (FaTiGue EVeNT) and FTGLOAD  (FaTiGue
LOADing). FTGEVNT  is used to define the events of the load sequence and FTGLOAD  is used to define the actual
time variations and associate them with a stress distribution from the analysis. This example shows the
simplest request where there is only one load variation with time, thus only one event. The FTGSEQ selects
FTGEVNT 21, which in turn selects FTGLOAD 101. FTGLOAD 101 references TABLFTG  201 that
describes the time variation and associates it to SUBCASE 8 (in the case of SOL 101):&lt;/p&gt;

Fatigue Materials (MATFTG)
The MATFTG  (MATerial FaTiGue) defines the fatigue material properties.   It must be associated to an existing
MAT1 entry with the same ID.   In the example that has been used thus far, a crack initiation analysis has
been selected by the FTGPARM entry. This means that e-N material data is necessary. This data can be
derived by simply supplying the ultimate tensile strength and a material code defining the type of metal as
shown or actual -N parameters can be entered as described in the user documentation.

Methods for Rigid Element Solution
Linear Method
In MSC Nastran, two methods for rigid elements are available &amp;ndash; the linear method and the Lagrange
method.The linear method is the default method in MSC Nastran. The linear method uses the linear
elimination technique. The rigid elements are not real elements, they are internally represented by a set of
MPC equations. By using these MPC equations, the dependent degrees-of-freedom (the m-set) are
eliminated from the solution set. The rigid elements linear method has the following limitations:
Do not compute thermal load.
Do not have a differential stiffness matrix; therefore, the solutions are incorrect for the buckling
analysis or other solution sequences where the differential stiffness matrix is required.
Use the small rotation theory in the geometrical nonlinear analysis so that the solutions are incorrect
in this type of analysis.
Use the elimination method for solution, resulting in very dense stiffness matrices. These dense
matrices cannot take advantages of the sparse matrix algorithm.
Lagrange Method
With the Lagrange method, the rigid elements become “real” finite elements, similar to, for example, a
QUAD4 element. Instead of using MPC equations, the element stiffness matrix is computed for each rigid
element. All the limitations for the linear method are removed, i.e., the rigid elements
Include thermal load effect.
Include the differential stiffness.
Support for both the small rotation and the large rotation. Use the large rotation theory in the
geometrical nonlinear analysis (PARAM,LGDISP,1). Not available for SOL 101, use SOL 400 if
large displacements or large rotations are present.
Take advantages of the sparse matrix algorithm if the augmented Lagrange multiplier method,
defined below, is used.
For each Lagrange rigid element, a number of Lagrange multiplier degrees-of-freedom are created internally
by MSC Nastran. For example, one to six Lagrange multiplier degrees-of-freedom are created for the RBAR
and one Lagrange multiplier degree-of-freedom is created for the RROD. For each Lagrange rigid element,
the independent degrees-of freedom, the dependent degrees-of-freedom, and the Lagrange multiplier
degrees-of-freedom are left in the solution set (the l-set).
For the Lagrange Multiplier Method, the solution is obtained with the independent degrees-of-freedom, the
dependent degrees-of-freedom, and the Lagrange multipliers degrees-of-freedom left in the solution set.
Thus, the sparse characteristic of the stiffness matrix is maintained and sparse matrix algorithms can be used.
See Rigid Element Enhancements  in the MSC Nastran Reference Guide  for a theoritical discussion of these methods
and the use of Rigid elements for large rotations.&lt;/p&gt;

Method Selection
The Control Case command, RIGID (Case)  in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide selects the type of rigid
element. It has the following format:
LINEAR will select the linear rigid elements, LAGR will select the Lagrange rigid element with the Lagrange
multiplier method, and LGELIM will select the Lagrange element with the Lagrange elimination method
(not used in Statics). If the RIGID command does not exist in the user Case Control file, the linear rigid
element will be used.
Introduction to R-Type Elements
An R-type element is an element that imposes fixed constraints between components of motion at the grid
points or scalar points to which they are connected.  They could also be called constraint elements. Thus, an
R-type element is mathematically equivalent to one or more multipoint constraint equations (discussed in
Constraints ).  Each constraint equation  expresses one dependent degree of freedom  as a linear function of the
independent degrees of freedom .
The R-type elements are sometimes referred to as rigid elements; however, the name “rigid” is misleading.&lt;br&gt;
The R-type elements that are rigid consist of the RROD , RBAR , RBAR1,RJOINT , RBE1 , RBE2 , RTRPLT&lt;br&gt;
and RTRPLT1. The RBE3  and RSPLINE  are interpolation elements and are not rigid.  A brief description
of all of the R-type elements is presented in the next section followed by a detailed description of the RBAR,
RBE2, and RBE3 elements; and a brief discussion of the RJOINT element.
The discussions below assume a Linear method selection (the default). There are some differences in the Bulk
Data entries when changing from Linear to Lagrange. They are discussed in Lagrange Method Bulk Data Entry
Differences .
Description of the R-Type Elements
Each of the R-type elements generates internal MPC  equations in MSC Nastran.  These equations are
generated automatically; you do not need to specify an MPC request in the Case Control Section.  R-type
elements are included in your model if they are included in the Bulk Data Section. Unlike the MPC entries,
an R-type element cannot be changed between subcases.
When using an R-type element, it is your responsibility to define which degrees of freedom are dependent
and which are independent.  The simplest way to describe this is to say that the motion of a dependent degree
of freedom is expressed as a linear combination of one or more of the independent degrees of freedom.  All
dependent degrees of freedom are placed in what is referred to as the m-set.  The independent degrees of
freedom are temporarily placed in the n-set, which is the set that is not made dependent by MPCs or R-type
elements.  A constraint equation (an internal MPC equation) is generated for each dependent degree of
freedom.  A complete description of MSC Nastran sets is given in Matrix Operations .RIGIDLINEAR

Description of the R-Type Elements310
Main Index
Seven R-type elements are described, together with the number of constraint equations generated for each of
the elements.  This number is the same as the number of dependent degrees of freedom that you specify for
the element.
As an introduction to the R-type elements, consider the RROD rigid element.  For the RROD element, you
specify a single component of translation at one of its two end points as a dependent degree of freedom.  The
equivalent component at the other end is the independent degree of freedom.  Consider the example shown
in Figure 8-1.Table 8-1  R-Type Elements Available in MSC Nastran

RBE3 Defines a constraint relation in which the motion at a
“reference” grid point is the least square weighted average of
the motions at other grid points.  The element is useful for
“beaming” loads and masses from a “reference” grid point
to a set of grid points.1 &amp;lt; m &amp;lt; 6
RSPLINE Defines a constraint relation whose coefficients are derived
from the deflections and slopes of a flexible tubular beam
connected to the referenced grid points.  This element is
useful in changing mesh size in finite element models.m &amp;gt; 1&lt;/p&gt;

Figure 8-1  An RROD Connection
For this example, a rigid connection is made between the X component of grid point 3 to the X component
of grid point 2. When you specify the Bulk Data entry RROD  as shown, you are placing component 1 of grid
point 3 (in the global system) into the m-set. The remaining 5 components at grid point 3 and all the
components at grid point 2 are placed in the n-set and hence, are independent. CBAR 1 is not connected to
components Y, Z, Rx, Ry and Rz of grid point 3 in any manner; therefore, the ends of the bars are free to move
in any of these directions.
However, the ends of the two CBAR elements are rigidly attached in the X-direction. Having the connection
only in the X-direction shows that one degree of freedom is placed in the m-set for each RROD element.
For the other six R-type elements, several degrees of freedom may be specified as members of the m-set or
the n-set. (Again, the latter designation may be temporary; they may be removed by additional constraints
in your model) . For the RTRPLT , RBE1, RROD, and RBE3 elements, any unlisted degrees of freedom at
the grid points to which the element is joined are not connected to the element. This lack of connection can
be regarded as either a sliding release or a rotating joint release, or both.
Five of the R-type elements (RBAR, RJOINT , RTRPLT, RBE1, and RBE2) must have exactly six
components of motion in the n-set (i.e., independent degrees of freedom). These six degrees of freedom must
be able to represent all of the rigid body motions of the element. Another important requirement is that the
three rules described in Constraints  for MPC entries must also be observed by the R-type elements. Typical
applications that use R-type entries are shown in Table 8-2.

The RBAR Element312
Main Index
One word of caution is that the connection of two or more rigid elements to the same grid point should be
done carefully to avoid specifying a degree of freedom as a member of the m-set more than once; otherwise,
a fatal message is issued.
The use of PARAM,CHECKOUT,YES, see CHECKOUT  in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide , is a useful
way to check rigid elements and MPC’s. See Chapter 7.4.1 Constraint Modules of the MSC Nastran Reference
Guide for a detailed description of the tests performed.
The RBAR  Element
The RBAR element rigidly connects from one to six dependent degrees of freedom (the m-set) to exactly six
independent degrees of freedom. The six independent degrees of freedom must be capable of describing the
rigid body properties of the element.
The format for the Bulk Data entry, RBAR in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide is as follows:

RBAR1
The most common approach when using the RBAR element is to define one end of the RBAR with all six
independent degrees of freedom with dependent degrees of freedom at the other end, i .e. the RBAR1 format.
(However, placing all of the independent degrees of freedom at one end is not a requirement) . To determine
if the choice you make for the independent degrees of freedom meets the rigid body requirements, ensure
that the element passes the following simple test:
If you constrain all of the degrees of freedom defined as independent on the RBAR element, is the element
prevented from any possible rigid body motion?
As an example, consider the RBAR configurations shown in Figure 8-2. For configurations (a) and (c), if the
six independent degrees of freedom are held fixed, the element cannot move as a rigid body in any direction.&lt;br&gt;
However, for (b), if all six of the independent degrees of freedom are held fixed, the element can still rotate
about the Y-axis. Configuration (b) does not pass the rigid body test and does not work as an RBAR element.

The RBAR Element314
Main Index
MSC Nastran generates internal MPC  equations for the R-type elements. As an example of this, consider the
model of a thick plate with bars attached as shown in Figure 8-3. The interface between the bars and the plate
is modeled two ways, first using MPC entries and second using RBAR elements.
Figure 8-3  Model of a Thick Plate with Bars Attached
Option 1 &amp;ndash; Model the T ransition with MPC Equations
Plate theory states that plane sections remain planar. If this is the case, then grid points 2 and 3 are secondary
to grid point 1. Therefore, you need to write the equations for the in-plane motion of grid points 2 and 3 as
a function of grid point 1. Each RBAR element creates up to six constraint equations.
Looking only at the motion in the x-y plane,
The MPC entries for this model are as follows:

Option 2 - Model the T ransition with RBAR Entries
The R-type elements are easier to use than the equivalent MPC entries.
RBAR 99 generates MPC equations for the motion of grid point 2 as a function of grid point 1. Likewise,
RBAR 100 generates MPC equations for the motion of grid point 3 as a function of grid point 1. These
RBARs generate the MPC equations for all six DOFs at grid points 2 and 3.  If it is desired to have the
equations generated only for the in-plane motion, the field labeled as CMB in the RBAR entries has the
values 126 entered.
A particular area of confusion for the new user is when you need to connect R-type elements together. The
important thing to remember is that you can place a degree of freedom into the m-set only once. Consider
the two RBAR elements shown in Figure 8-4 that are acting as a single rigid member.
If you choose grid point 1 for RBAR 1 to be independent (1-6), then grid point 2 for RBAR 1 must be
dependent (1-6).  Since grid point 2 is dependent for RBAR 1, it must be made independent for RBAR 2.&lt;br&gt;
If you made grid point 2 dependent for RBAR 2 as well as RBAR 1, a fatal error would result. Since grid
point 2 is independent (1-6) for RBAR 2, grid point 3 will be dependent (1-6).
If you chose grid point 1 of RBAR 1 to be dependent, then grid point 2 for RBAR 1 would be independent.&lt;br&gt;
Grid point 2 of RBAR 2 would be dependent, and grid point 3 of RBAR 2 would be independent.
The RBAR element is often used to rigidly connect two grid points in your model.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

The simplest way to model the hinge connection with an RBAR is to use coincident grid points at the center
of rotation (grid points 2 and 3 in this example) and define an RBAR between the two grid points. This
RBAR has zero length, which is acceptable for the RBAR. Make all six of the components associated with
one grid point independent. Make only a select number of components of the other grid point dependent,
leaving independent the components representing the hinge. A listing of the input file for this model is
shown in Listing 8-2. (See MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/rbar2.dat) Note that the components 1 through 6 of
grid point 2 are independent and components 1 through 5 of grid point 3 are dependent. Component 6 of
the grid point 3 is left independent, permitting CBAR 2 to rotate about the Z axis with respect to CBAR 1.

ENDDATA
A word of caution:  if you intentionally use coincident grid points (as in this example), you may run the risk
of removing them accidentally if you later use the “equivalence” option available in most preprocessors.&lt;br&gt;
Equivalencing grid points causes all duplicate grid points in your model to be deleted; however, this may not
be your intention as illustrated in this example.
The RBE2  Element
The RBE2 provides a very convenient tool for rigidly connecting the same components of several grid points
together.  You should note that multiple RBARs or an RBE1 can be used wherever an RBE2 is used; however,
they may not be as convenient.
The format for the Bulk Data entry RBE2 is as follows:

for the element are assigned. (Integer &amp;gt; 0)
CM Component numbers of the dependent degrees-of-freedom in the global coordinate
system at grid points GMi. (Integers 1 through 6 with no embedded blanks.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;319 CHAPTER 8
R-Type Constraint Elements
Main Index
When using an RBE2, you need to specify a single independent grid point (the GN field) in which all six
components are assigned as independent.  In the CM field, you can specify the dependent degrees of freedom
at grid points GMi in the global coordinate system.  The GMi grid points are the grid points at which the
dependent degrees of freedom are assigned.  The dependent components are the same for all the listed grid
points (if this is unacceptable, use the RBAR elements, multiple RBE2s elements, or the RBE1 element).
As an example showing the use of an RBE2 element, consider the tube shown in Figure 8-6.  The goal is to
maintain a circular cross section at the end of the tube while applying a torque about the axis of the tube.&lt;br&gt;
Furthermore, you allow the tube to expand in the R direction, but the center of the end of the tube should
not move from its original position.
Figure 8-6  Tube with an End Torque Loading
A partial input file for this model is shown in Listing 8-3.  See /doc/linstat/torque.dat) The goal is to have the
end of the tube rotate uniformly while allowing the tube to expand in the R-direction.  The simplest way to
accomplish this is to define a local cylindrical coordinate system with the origin located at the center of the GMi Grid point identification numbers at which dependent degrees-of-freedom are
assigned.  (Integer &amp;gt; 0)

free end as shown in Figure 8-6.  This cylindrical coordinate system is then used as the displacement coordinate
system (field 7) for all of the grid points located at the free end. Now when an RBE2 element is connected
to these grid points, the dependent degrees of freedom are in the local coordinate system. By leaving the R-
direction independent, the tube is free to expand in the radial direction.
Grid point 999 is defined at the center of the free end to serve as the independent point. The , Z, Rr, R,
and Rz components of the grid points on the end of the tube are dependent degrees of freedom. T o ensure
that the axis of the tube remains in the same position, an SPC is applied to all components of grid point 999
except in the Rz direction, which is the component about which the torque is applied. It is interesting to note
that the CD field of grid point 999, the independent point, is different than that of the CD field of the
dependent point, and this is an acceptable modeling technique. Furthermore, you should always use a
rectangular coordinate system in the CD field for any grid point that lies on the polar axis. In this example,
grid point 999 lies on the Z-axis (see Figure 8-6); therefore, it should not use coordinate system 1 for its CD
field.

The RBE3 element is a powerful tool for distributing applied loads and mass in a model.  Unlike the RBAR
and RBE2 discussed in the previous sections, the RBE3 does not add additional stiffness to your structure.&lt;br&gt;
Forces and moments applied to reference points are distributed to a set of independent degrees of freedom&lt;br&gt;
based on the RBE3 geometry and local weight factors.

The manner in which the forces are distributed is analogous to the the classical bolt pattern analysis.&lt;br&gt;
Consider the bolt pattern shown in Figure 8-8 with a force and moment M acting at reference point A.  The
force and moment can be transferred directly to the weighted center of gravity location along with the
moment produced by the force offset.
Figure 8-8  RBE3 Equivalent Force and Moment at the Reference Point
The force is distributed to the bolts proportional to the weighting factors .  The moment is distributed as
forces, which are proportional to their distance from the center of gravity times their weighting factors, as
shown in Figure 8-9.  The total force acting on the bolts is equal to the sum of the two forces.  These results
apply to both in-plane and out-of-plane loadings.Reference Point

The plate is subjected to nonuniform pressure represented by a resultant force acting at a distance of 10 mm

Grid point 99 is called the REFGRID  and is the location where the force is applied. This point is connected
only to those degrees of freedom listed on the REFC  field (the T3 component in this example). The default
action of this element is to place the REFC degrees of freedom in the m-set. The element has provisions to
place other DOFs in the m-set instead. However, this is an advanced feature and is beyond the scope of this
user’s guide. The groups of connected grid points begin in field 5. For this example, the connected grid points
are the corner points.

The start of a group is indicated by a real number WTi, which is used as a weighting factor for the grid points
in the group. In this example, a simple distribution based only on the geometry of the RBE3 is desired so that
a uniform weight is applied to all points. The weighting factors are not required to add up to any specific
value.  For this example, if the WT1 field is 4.0 instead of 1.0, the results will be the same.
The independent degrees of freedom for the group are listed in the Ci field. Note that all three translational
DOFs are listed even though the REFC field does not include the T1- and T2-direction. All three
translational DOFs in the Ci field are included because the DOFs listed for all points must be adequate to
define the rigid body motion of the RBE3 element even when the element is not intended to carry loads in
certain directions.  If any translational degrees of freedom are not included in C1 in this example, a fatal
message is issued.
The element described by this RBE3 entry does not transmit forces in the T1- or T2-direction. The two
reasons for this are that the reference grid point is not connected in this direction and all of the connected
points are in the same plane. Note that the rotations are not used for the independent DOFs.  In general, it
is recommended that only the translational components be used for the independent degrees of freedom.
A selected portion of the output file produced by this example is shown in Figure 8-11.&lt;/p&gt;

Figure 8-11  Select Output for the RBE3 Example
The displacement of grid points 1 and 4 is zero due to the SPC  applied to these points.  The sum of the SPC
forces at these two grid points is equal to the load applied to the reference grid point.  The load transmitted
to the corner points can be seen by inspecting the GPFORCE  output.  The force applied to the points due
to the R-type elements and MPC entries is not listed specifically in the GPFORCE output.  These forces
show up as unbalanced totals (which should typically be equal to numeric zero).  The forces applied to the
corner grid points 1 through 4 are -20, -30, -30, and -20 N, respectively.
The most common usage of the RBE3 element is to transfer motion in such a way that all six DOFs of the
reference point are connected.  In this case, all six components are placed in the REFC field, and only
components 123 are placed in the Ci field.
The load distributing capability of the RBE3 element makes it an ideal element to use to apply loads from a
coarse model (or hand calculation) onto a detailed model of a component.  For example, the shear
distribution on a cross section is a function of the properties of that section.  This shear loading may be
applied to a cross section by performing a calculation of the shear distribution based on unit loading and
using an RBE3 element with appropriate weighting factors for each grid point.  In this manner, only one
shear distribution need be calculated by hand.  Since there are usually multiple loading conditions to be
considered in an analysis, they may be applied by defining different loads to the dependent point on the
RBE3 element.
For example, consider the tube attached to a back plate as shown in Figure 8-12.  Suppose that you are not
particularly interested in the stress in the tube or the attachment, but you are concerned about the stresses in
the back plate.  For this reason, you choose not to include the tube in the model; however, you want the load  D I S P L A C E M E N T   V E C T O R

transferred from the tube into the back plate attachment to be approximately correct.  The question is:  How
should the loads be applied to the attachment to simulate the behavior of the tube?
Engineering principles dictate that the Z forces (forces acting normal to the back plate) acting on the
attachment vary linearly as a function of the distance from the neutral axis.  The simplest method of
distributing the Z forces to the attachment grid is with an RBE2 or an RBE3 element.  If an RBE2 is used,
the attachment ring is rigid in the Z-direction.  If an RBE3 element is used, no additional stiffness is added
to the attachment ring.  It is an engineering decision regarding which element to use since both are
approximations.  For this example, use the RBE3 element.  Since the weight factors for the grid points in the
Z-direction are equal, the forces are distributed to the grid points based on the geometry of the grid pattern
only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;329 CHAPTER 8

Figure 8-12  Attachment Ring
The shear force acting on the attachment does not act linearly; it is maximum at the neutral plane and tapers
to zero at the top and bottom fibers (if the tube is solid, the shear distribution is a quadratic function, but in
our example, it is a thick walled tube).  The first step is to calculate the shear forces acting on the attachment
ring as a function of the distance from the neutral plane using the classical strength of materials calculations.&lt;br&gt;
The result of this calculation is shown in Figure 8-13.  The shear force curve is divided into two regions, each
region representing a grid point region as shown in Figure 8-12.  The area under the curve for each region
represents the portion of the shear force transmitted to the grid points within the region.  Using these area Region 2

ENDDATA
The most common user error in RBE3 element specification results from placing 4, 5, or 6 in the Ci
(independent DOF) field in addition to the translation components.  The rotations of the dependent point
are fully defined by the translational motion of the independent points.  The ability to input 4, 5, or 6 in the
Ci field is only for special applications, such as when all of the connected points are colinear.
Small checkout models are recommended whenever you are specifying elements with nonuniform weight
factors, asymmetric geometry or connected degrees of freedom, or irregular geometry.  Using small checkout
models is especially necessary when the reference point is not near the center of the connected points.
In summary, the intended use of the RBE3 element is to transmit forces and moments from a reference point
to several non-colinear points.  The rotation components 4, 5, and 6 should be placed in the Ci field only
for special cases, such as when the independent points are colinear.
The RJOINT Element
The RJOINT element defines a mechanical joint. The format for Bulk Data entry, RJOINT  is as follows:

RJOINT EID GA GB CB
Field Contents
EID Element identification number. (Integer &amp;gt; 0)
GA, GB Grid point identification numbers. (Integer &amp;gt; 0)
CB Component numbers in the global coordinate system at GB. These degrees-of-
freedom are constrained to move with the same degrees-of-freedom at GA. See
Remarks 4. and 5. (Integers 1 through 6 with no embedded or blank.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Linear Statics Analysis User’s Guide
The RJOINT Element332
Main Index
GA is the independent grid point and all six degrees-of-freedom are independent. GB is the dependent grid
point. The length between points GA and GB must be zero. Because its length is zero, the thermal load effect
is not applicable.
If CB=123456 or is left blank, then the grid point GB is constrained to move with the grid point GA, and
two the grid points move as a single point. If any degree-of-freedom is released on CB, then RJOINT
becomes a mechanical joint. A mechanical joint is a mechanical system that has two bodies jointed at a point.
The two bodies can rotate relatively about one, two, or three axes of a local coordinate system at that point.
For example:
Hinge - A hinge is a mechanical joint that rotates freely about one axis about the local coordinate
system. It can be simulated by RJOINT with one rotational degree of freedom released, i.e., CB =
12356, 12346, or 12345.
Universal joint - A universal joint is a mechanical joint that rotates freely in two axes. It can be
simulated by RJOINT with two rotational degrees-of-freedom released, i.e., CB = 1234, 1235, or
1236.
Spherical joint - A spherical joint is a mechanical joint that rotates freely about all three axes. It can
be simulated by a zero length RJOINT with all rotational degrees of freedom released, i.e. CB = 123.
Prismatic joint - A prismatic joint is a mechanical system with two blocks that are constrained to
have the same rotations, but translate relative with each other along a local axis. It can be simulated
by RJOINT with one translational degree-of-freedom released, i.e., CB = 23456, 13456, 12456.
Cylindrical joint - A cylindrical joint is a mechanical system that allows two grid points to have
relative translation along a moving axis and, at the same, have relative rotation about the same axis.
It can be simulated by RJOINT with one translational degree of freedom and one rotational degree
of freedom released, i.e. CB = 2356, 1346, 1245.
Guidelines for the RJOINT element:
The theory for the RJOINT is formulated such that a consistent mechanical joint is created even if
the user requests different global coordinate systems at grid points GA and GB. If different global
coordinate systems are used, the degrees-of-freedom to be released are determined by the coordinate
system at GB.
For linear or nonlinear static analysis, the joints must be constrained by other elements in the
structural model. Otherwise, a singular stiffness matrix may be produced, leading to failure during
decomposition.
Lagrange Method Bulk Data Entry Differences
The R-type elements; RBAR, RBAR1, RJOINT , RBE1, RBE2, RBE3, RROD, RTRPLT and RTRPLT1;
can be used as either the linear rigid element or the Lagrange element, as selected by the Case Control
command, RIGID. However, the input rules are not the same for these two types of rigid elements. The
following paragraphs discuss the differences.
Except for the RBE3 and RROD, the major difference in the input format between the linear rigid element
and the Lagrange rigid element is the selection of the independent degrees-of-freedom. This can be illustrated
by the Bulk Data entry for RBAR:
RBAR EID GA GB CNA CNB CMA CMB ALPHA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;333 CHAPTER 8
R-Type Constraint Elements
Main Index
The independent degrees-of-freedom are selected by CNA and CNB. For the linear rigid element, the
independent degrees-of-freedom can be assigned to both CNA and CNB: for example, “CNA=1236,
CNB=34”, as long as the total number equals to six and they can jointly represent any general rigid body
motion. However, for the Lagrange rigid element, all six independent degrees-of-freedom must be assigned
to a single grid point, i.e., “CNA=123456, CNB=blank”, or “CNA=blank, CNB=123456”. The same rule
applies to the RBE1, RBE2, and RTRPLT elements. The RBAR1 and RTRPLT1 entries make it easier to
input the Lagrange rigid elements.
For the RBE3, the REFC degrees-of-freedom can be any combination of integers from 1 through 6 for the
linear rigid element. For the Lagrange rigid element, RFEC must be 123, 456, or 123456.
For the RROD element, the user must select one dependent degree-of-freedom by inputting either CMA or
CMB for the linear rigid element. However, for the Lagrange rigid element, the user can leave both fields
blank and let MSC Nastran select the best component as the dependent degree-of-freedom. In fact, this is
the recommended method.
For all rigid elements, the ALPHA field is the thermal coefficient of expansion. For the Lagrange rigid
elements, if ALPHA is given and the thermal loads are requested by the Case Control command
TEMPERATURE(INITIAL) and TEMPERATURE(LOAD), the thermal load effect will be computed for
the rigid elements. The temperature loads are taken as the average temperature given by the independent grid
point and the dependent grid point. For example, the temperature load for the RBAR element is taken as the
average temperature of grid points GA and GB. For the linear rigid element, no temperature effect is
computed and the ALPHA field is ignored.
Example - Linear Static Analysis with Thermal Loads
To illustrate the effect of thermal loads on the Lagrange rigid elements in a static analysis, a simple beam is
modeled by a RBAR1 element with a length of 1.0. At left end of the beam, a very soft rotational spring is
connected to the normal rotation and the remaining five degrees-of freedom are fixed. At the right end, all
six degrees-of-freedom are free with a vertical force of 100.0 is acting on it. This beam is subjected to a
thermal load, which will double its length to 2.0. This problem is solved by the Lagrange multiplier method
(RIGID=LAGR). (See MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/nlrgd11a.dat)

Introduction to Modeling Guidelines
Finite element modeling in many ways is more like an art than a science since the quality of the results is
dependent upon the quality of your model. One of the more common errors that a beginning finite element
analyst makes in modeling is to simply simulate the geometry rather than to simulate both the geometry and
the physical behavior of the real structure.  The following modeling guidelines are provided to put a little more
science back into the art of finite element modeling:
Choosing the right element
Mesh density
Mesh transitions
Grid point stresses
Consistent loading
Symmetry
The above guidelines are by no means complete; however, they do serve as a good starting point. There is no
better substitute for good modeling than experience.  It is also good modeling practice to simulate and validate
a new capability or a feature that you have not used before with a small prototype model before applying this
feature to your production model.  Model verification techniques are covered in Model Verification .
Choosing the Right Element
MSC Nastran contains a large library of structural elements.  In many situations several elements are capable
of modeling the same structural effects.  The criteria for the selection of an element may include its
capabilities (for example, whether it supports anisotropic material properties), its cost (in general, the more
DOF an element has, the more expensive it is), and/or its accuracy.
In many cases the choice of the best element for a particular application may not be obvious.  For example, in
the model of a space frame, you may choose to use CROD  elements if end moments are unimportant or to
use CBAR  elements if end moments are important. You may choose to use CBEAM  elements with warping
if the members have open cross sections and torsional stresses are estimated to be significant. Y ou may even
choose to represent the members with built-up assemblies of plate or solid elements.  The choice of which
type and number of elements to use depends primarily on your assessment of the effects that are important
to represent in your model and on the cost and accuracy you are willing to accept.
In this context, it is critical that you have a fairly good idea of how the structure will behave prior to
generating your finite element model.  The best source of such insight is usually experience with similar
structures. In other words, understanding the load path is crucial in the selection of the appropriate element.&lt;br&gt;
In addition, a few hand calculations can usually provide a rough estimate of stress intensities. Such
calculations are always recommended.  If you do not have a fairly good idea of how the structure will behave,
you may be misled by incorrect results due to errors or incorrect assumptions in your input data preparation.
The following guidelines are provided to help you in selecting the “right” element for your task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;333 CHAPTER 9
Modeling Guidelines
Main Index
General Guidelines
Always experiment with a small test model when using elements that you are not familiar with.  This practice
is cheaper than experimenting with a large production model, and it gives you a better understanding of an
element’s capabilities and limitations prior to applying it to a large production model.
Zero-Dimensional Elements
When you use CELASi elements to represent concentrated springs between two components of translation,
the directions of the two components must be coaxial. Even small deviations in direction can induce a
significant moment to your model that does not exist in your physical structure. It is recommended that
when a CELASi element is used, the locations of the two end points be coincident in order to avoid this type
of problem. If the two end points are not coincident, you should consider using a CROD or CBUSH
element instead.
One-Dimensional Elements
If only an axial and/or torsion load is to be transmitted in an element, then the CROD is the easiest element
to use.
A CBAR  is easier to use than a CBEAM  element. The I1 and/or I2 values can be set to zero.
Use the CBEAM element instead of the CBAR element if any of the following features is important:
The cross-sectional properties are tapered.
The neutral axis and shear center do not coincide.
The effect of cross-sectional warping on torsional stiffness is critical.
The difference in the mass center of gravity and the shear center is significant.
The formulation for the CBEAM  element is based on a flexibility approach; the element stiffness matrix is
generated by inverting the flexibility matrix. F or this reason, I1 and I2 must not be zero for the CBEAM
element.
CBEAM3 elements favor a structure with initial curvatures and with high order shell elements.
Two-Dimensional Elements
In general, quadrilateral elements (CQUAD4 , CQUADR and CQUAD8 ) are preferred over the triangular
elements (CTRIA3 , CTRIAR a nd CTRIA6). The CTRIA3 element is a constant strain element.  It is
excessively stiff, and w hen used alone, it is generally less accurate than the CQUAD4  element, particularly
for membrane strain. Whenever feasible, the CQUAD4 element should be used instead of the CTRIA3
element.  CTRIA3 should only be used when necessary for geometric or topological reasons, for example,
mesh transition between regions of quadrilateral elements with different meshes or near the polar axis of a
spherical shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Linear Statics Analysis User’s Guide
Choosing the Right Element334
Main Index
Avoid using CTRIA3  in locations where the membrane stresses are changing rapidly, for example, in the web
of an I-beam.  Since CTRIA3 has constant membrane stresses, a large number of them may be needed to
obtain acceptable accuracy.  It is better to use quadrilateral elements or CTRIA6  elements, if possible.
Do not use plate or shell elements (CQUADi, CTRIAi) in stiffened shell structures with very thin panels that
can buckle.  Shear panels (CSHEAR) should be used in this case or in any situation where direct stresses
cannot be supported, such as in a very thin curved panel.
Avoid highly skewed elements (see Figure 9-1).  The angle should be as close to 90 degrees as possible.
Figure 9-1  Highly Skewed Element
For the CTRIA3 element, the skew test is based upon the three vertex angles.
Aspect ratio is defined as l/ (length/width). V ery high aspect ratio (see Figure 9-2) should also be avoided,
although it is no longer true that accuracy degrades rapidly with aspect ratios as it once did with some of the
obsolete elements.
Figure 9-2  Element with High Aspect Ratio
Warping is a measure of the amount the element deviates from being planar (see Figure 9-3).  Element warping
should be minimized.
Figure 9-3  Highly Warped Element
For the CQUAD8  elements, if midside nodes are present, they should be located within the middle third of
the edge.  If a midside node is located at one-fourth the distance of the edge as measured from either corner 

node on the edge, the internal strain field becomes singular at the corners of the element.  For best results, it
is recommended that the midside node be located as close to the center of the edge as possible.  If midside
nodes are desired, the general recommendation is to include all of them.  A CQUAD8 element with midside
nodes deleted is excessively stiff and therefore is inferior to a CQUAD4  element.
Figure 9-4  CQUAD8 with Missing Midside Node
For single curved structures (e.g., a cylinder), the CQUAD8, in general, yields better results than the
CQUAD4 element.  For doubly curved structures (e.g., a spherical dome), the CQUAD4 element, in
general, performs better than the CQUAD8 (see Reference 13.).
The shell normal (param,snorm,x) should be turned on when using the CQUAD4, CTRIA3, CQUADR,
or CTRIAR element.  See Shell Normals  for further details.
The membrane properties for the CQUADR  and CTRIAR  elements are less sensitive to the element shape
than the CQUAD4 and CTRIA3. The CQUADR and CTRIAR elements can be used in conjunction with
each other, but not with other elements. CQUADR and CTRIAR should not be used for nonlinear analysis.
An increase in accuracy can be expected when using the QUADR element vs the QUAD4 element,
particularly in areas of the model that are more coarsely meshed. However the QUADR element has other
restrictions which make the QUAD4 element the generally recommended element.
Existing QUAD4 element models can easily be converted to QUADR elements by setting System Cell
(QRMETH (370) ) in the NASTRAN Statement.  QRMETH=5 will convert all QUAD4/TRIA3 elements in the
model to QUADR/TRIAR. T o show the difference in accuracy between the QUADR and QUAD4
elements, four mesh element sizes for a simple “T-Section” test model were run using MSC Nastran. von
Mises stress results, taken at a central position in the “T-Section”, were compared and they showed the
QUADR was more consistent and accurate as the size was reduced. See Figure 9-5.&lt;/p&gt;

Choosing the Right Element336
Main Index
Figure 9-5&lt;br&gt;
Shell Normals
By default, the direction of the normal rotation vector for flat plate elements is assumed to be perpendicular
to the plane of each element. If the model is curved, the shell bending and twist moments must change
direction at the element intersection. If transverse shear flexibility is present, the deformations may be too
large. (Because elements using low-order formulations ignore the edge effect, this rarely causes any problems-
the default value of 100 on the parameter K6ROT partially cures the problem.) With the unique normal
(SNORM) option, the rotational degrees of freedom at each corner of an element are measured relative to
the specified normal vector direction. Thus, all elements connected to a grid point will use a consistent
direction for defining shell bending and twisting moments.
In CQUAD4 and CTRIA3 elements, the stiffness matrices of the elements are modified to eliminate the
undesirable small stiffness in the rotational motions about the shell normal vector. In effect, the
transformation replaces the normal moments with in-plane forces. No changes were made to the basic
element stiffness matrix, and therefore flat plate models will not be affected. The objective of the new
transformation was to remove a potential weakness in curved shell models and allow the automatic constraint
process to remove the true singularity in the assembled stiffness matrix.
The CQUADR and CTRIAR elements are also improved for some types of shell problems. Because of their
extra degrees of freedom, these elements are more sensitive to the coupling between in-plane and out-of-plane
motion due to curvature. This formulation of using a common unique normal, provides more consistency
between adjacent elements in a curved shell.
Shell normals are available for CQUAD4, CQUADR, CTRIA3, and CTRIAR elements.  Normals are
activated if the actual angle between the local element normal and the unique grid point normal is less than
20°, the default value for  (see Figure 9-6.) The default for  c an be changed by setting PARAM, SNORM , to
Mesh Size&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;337 CHAPTER 9

the desired real value up to 89 degrees. The unique grid point normal is the average of all local shell element
normals at a specific grid point.  Generated grid point normals may be overwritten by user-defined normals.
Figure 9-6  Unique Grid Point Normal
A shell normal defines a unique direction for the rotational degrees of freedom of all adjacent elements.  A
shell normal vector is created by averaging the normal vectors of the attached elements.  If the actual angle
is greater than the value defined on PARAM,SNORM, (default =20.) the edge is assumed to be a corner,
and the old method is used. Shell normals improve the accuracy of the results in curved shells where in-plane
shear and twisting moments act together.
If the actual shell normal vector is known, such as in a cylinder or sphere, the automatically calculated values
may be superseded by the actual vectors using the Bulk Data entry
SNORM ,GID,CID,V1,V2,V3
where GID is a unique grid point, CID is the coordinate system for defining the shell normal vector and V1,
V2, and V3 are unscaled components of the vector in the coordinate system.
A second parameter, Unique Grid Point Normal for Adjacent Shell Elements , controls the print or punch of values of
the internal shell normals. The output format is the same as the SNORM Bulk Data so that the individual
values may be used and modified on a subsequent job.
Remarks and Recommendations
The following remarks are applicable to the shell normal option:
1.The type of structure that exhibits the most change in results is a thick curved shell with large in-plane
shear forces and twisting moments.
2.Most other problems, such as flat plates and curved shells with pressure loads, show changes in results
of less than 1%.  More degrees of freedom may be constrained using this improved formulation. This
formulation results in zero in-plane rotational stiffness values. Grid Point

3.It has been observed from testing that the automatic normal vector calculations produced answers
nearly equal to and as accurate as those using the explicit SNORM vector input. In other words, the
results were insensitive to small differences in the direction of the vectors. The important fact is that
the shell normal vector requires the connected elements to use a consistent normal direction.
4.The CQUAD8 and CTRIA6 elements are not included in the shell normal processing.  If they are
modeled correctly, they do not require shell normal processing. Connecting these elements to the
lower-order flat elements is not recommended.
5.Curved shell elements have no stiffness in the rotational degree of freedom when the formulation is
used-consequently, mechanisms may be introduced.  Mechanisms occur when elements, RBEs, or
MPCs are connected to the out-of-plane rotation of the shell grid points.  Note that
PARAM,AUTOSPC,YES does not constrain these mechanisms.
6.In linear solution sequences, the values of “param,k6rot,100.” and “param,snorm,20.” are the default.
7.Transverse shear  flexibility (MID3 on the PSHELL property entry) should be left on when normals
are used.
Three-Dimensional Elements
Although the CHEXA  and CPENTA  elements are designed to behave reasonably well as thin shell elements,
it is recommended that they not be used in this capacity.  The high ratio of extensional stiffness in the
direction normal to the effective transverse shear stiffness can produce significant round-off errors.
As in the case of plate elements, if midside nodes are present for the solid elements, they should be located as
close to the center of the edge as possible.  Again, if midside nodes are desired, the general recommendation
is to include all of them.
R-Type Elements
A high degree of precision must be maintained when specifying coefficients for MPCs  in order to avoid
introduction of unintentional constraints to rigid body motions.  Rigid elements (e.g., the RBE2 , RBAR ,
etc.) should be used whenever possible because their constraint coefficients are internally calculated to a high
precision.  Furthermore, these R-type elements require much less user interaction. The weld family of
elements offer excellent ways of modeling structural connections.
Mesh Density
The mesh density  in a finite element model is an important topic because of its relationship to accuracy and
cost.  In many instances, the minimum number of elements is set by topological considerations, for example,
one element per member in a space frame or one element per panel in a stiffened shell structure.  In the past,
when problem size was more severely limited, it was not uncommon to lump two or more frames or other
similar elements in order to reduce the size of the model.  With computers becoming faster and cheaper, the
current trend is to represent all major components individually in the finite element model.
If the minimum topological requirements are easily satisfied, the question remains as to how fine to subdivide
the major components.  The question is particularly relevant for elastic continua, such as slabs and&lt;/p&gt;

unreinforced shells.  In general, as the mesh density increases, you can expect the results to become more
accurate.  The mesh density required can be a function of many factors.  Among them are the stress gradients ,
the type of loadings, the boundary conditions, the element types used, the element shapes, and the degree of
accuracy desired.
The grid point spacing should typically be the smallest in regions where stress gradients are expected to be
the steepest. Figure 9-7 shows a typical example of a stress concentration near a circular hole.  The model is a
circular disk with an inner radius = a and an outer radius = b.  A pressure load pi is applied to the inner surface.&lt;br&gt;
Due to symmetry, only half of the disk is modeled.  In the example, both the radial stress and the
circumferential stress  decrease as a function of l/r2 from the center of the hole.  The error in the finite element
analysis arises from differences between the real stress distribution and the stress distribution within the finite
elements.
In a study of mesh densities, elements and output options, three different mesh densities were used in the
example as shown in Figure 9-7. The first one is a coarse mesh model with the elements evenly distributed.&lt;br&gt;
The second model consists of the same number of elements; however, the mesh is biased toward the center
of the hole.  The third model consists of a denser mesh with the elements evenly distributed.  These three
models are then analyzed with three different element types-CQUAD4 , CQUAD8 , and CQUAD4 with the
corner stress option.  The circumferential stress at the inner radius is always greater than pi, which is the
applied pressure load at the inner radius, and approaches this value as the outer radius becomes larger.  The
theoretical circumferential stress  (see Timoshenko and Goodier, Theory of Elasticity , Reference 3.) is given
by the following equation:
where:
The stresses are then plotted as a function of the radius in a nondimensional fashion-stress pi/ versus r/a.  The
results are summarized in Table 9-1.a=inner radius

For this particular case, since the stresses are proportional to 1/r2, you expect the highest stress to occur at
the inner radius.  In order to take advantage of this piece of information, the obvious thing to do is to create
a finer mesh around the inner radius.  Looking at the results for the first two cases in Table 9-1, it is quite
obvious that just by biasing the mesh, the results are 30% closer to the theoretical solution with the same
number of degrees of freedom.
A third case is analyzed with a finer but unbiased mesh.  It is interesting to note that for case number 3, even
though it has more degrees of freedom, the result is still not as good as that of case number 2.  This poor result
is due to the fact that for the CQUAD4 element, the stresses, by default, are calculated at the center of the
element and are assumed to be constant throughout the element. Looking at Figure 9-7, it is also obvious that
the centers of the inner row of elements are actually further away from the center of the circle for case number
3 as compared to case number 2.  The results for case number 3 can, of course, be improved drastically by
biasing the mesh.
You can request corner outputs (stress, strain, and force) for CQUAD4 in addition to the center values ( Shell
Elements (CTRIA3 , CTRIA6 , CTRIAR , CQUAD4 , CQUAD8 , CQUADR )) in the MSC Nastran Refernce Guide . Corner results
are extrapolated from the corner displacements and rotations by using a strain rosette analogy with a cubic
correction for bending. The same three models are then rerun with this corner option&amp;ndash;their results are
summarized in cases 7 through 9. Note that the results can improve substantially for the same number
degrees of freedom.
Corner output is selected by using a corner output  option with the STRESS, STRAIN, and FORCE Case
Control commands. When one of these options is selected, output is computed at the center and four corners
for each CQUAD4 element, in a format similar to that of CQUAD8 and CQUADR elements.
There are four corner output options available: CORNER , CUBIC , SGAGE , and BILIN . The different
options provide for different approaches to the stress calculations. The default option is CORNER, which is
equivalent to BILIN.  BILIN has been shown to produce better results for a wider range of problems.
To carry it a step further, the same three models are then rerun with CQUAD8  (cases 4 through 6).  In this
case, the results using CQUAD8 are better than those using the CQUAD4.  This result is expected since
CQUAD8 contains more DOFs  per element than CQUAD4 . Looking at column three of Table 9-1, you can
see that due to the existence of midside nodes, the models using CQUAD8 contain several times the number
of DOFs as compared to CQUAD4 for the same number of elements. The results using CQUAD4 can, of
course, be improved by increasing the mesh density to approach that of the CQUAD8 in terms of number
of DOFs.  7 CQUAD4 with Corner Option 194 Coarse, Even Mesh 1.142

It is important to realize that the stresses are compared at different locations for Cases 1 through 3 versus
Cases 4 through 9. This difference occurs because the stresses are available only at the element centers for
Cases 1 through 3, but the stresses are available at the corners as well as the element centers for Cases 4
through 9.  When looking at your results using a stress contour plot, you should be aware of where the stresses
are being evaluated.
How fine a mesh you want depends on many factors. Among them is the cost you are willing to pay versus
the accuracy you are receiving.  The cost increases with the number of DOFs. The definition of cost has
changed with time.  In the past, cost is generally associated with computer time. With both hardware and
software becoming faster each day, cost is probably associated more with the time required for you to debug
and interpret your results.  In general, the larger the model is, the more time it takes you to debug and
interpret your results.  As for acceptable accuracy, proceeding from case 8 to case 6, the error is reduced from
4.7% to 1.5%; however, the size of the problem is also increased from 194 to 2538 DOFs.  In some cases, a
4.7% error may be acceptable.  For example, in cases in which you are certain of the loads to within only a
10% accuracy, a 4.7% error may be acceptable.  In other cases, a 1.5% error may not be acceptable.
In general, if you can visualize the form of the solution beforehand, you can then bias the grid point
distribution.  However, this type of information is not necessarily available in all cases.  If a better assessment
of accuracy is required and resources are available (time and money), you can always establish error bounds
for a particular problem by constructing and analyzing multiple mesh spacings of the same model and observe
the convergences.  This approach, however, may not be realistic due to the time constraint.
The stress discontinuity feature, as described in Model Verification , may be used for accessing the quality of the
mesh density for the conventional h-version elements.
Getting a good starting mesh density can be very useful, but there are mesh refinements which can be
performed “automatically” inside MSC Nastran. One is the use of Local Adaptive Mesh Refinement  for h-
elemen ts.
h-elements
In traditional finite element analysis, as the number of elements increases, the accuracy of the solution
improves.  The accuracy of the problem can be measured quantitatively with various entities, such as strain
energies, displacements, and stresses, as well as in various error estimation methods, such as simple
mathematical norm or root-mean-square methods.  The goal is to perform an accurate prediction on the
behavior of your actual model by using these error analysis methods.  You can modify a series of finite element
analyses either manually or automatically by reducing the size and increasing the number of elements, which
is the usual h-adaptivity method.  Each element is formulated mathematically with a certain predetermined
order of shape functions.  This polynomial order does not change in the h-adaptivity method.  The elements
associated with this type of capability are called the h-elements.
Mesh Transitions
Mesh transition  can be a complicated subject.  It may simply be used to refine the mesh in a particular area,
connect different element types (for example, a CBAR  element to a solid element), or provide transitions
required to model the geometry of the structure.  Two guidelines for mesh transitions are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;343 CHAPTER 9
Modeling Guidelines
Main Index
Never place a mesh transition in an area of interest or in an area where there is a large variation in
stress.
Mesh transitions should be located away from the areas of interest in a region.
Due to incompatibilities between finite element types, any transition between different element types (even
a transition from CQUAD4  to CTRIA3  elements) can result in local stress anomalies.  Normally, these stress
anomalies are localized and dissipate quickly as you move away from the transition.  However, a problem
arises when the transition occurs in an area of interest.  In this case, the local stress rises (or decreases) due to
the effect of the transition; in other words, the results may be conservative (or unconservative) in an area near
a transition.  However, if this localized stress variation occurs away from areas of interest, the increase (or
decrease) in stress caused by the transition should cause no concern.
Transition from a Coarse Mesh to a Fine Mesh
The transition from a coarse mesh  to a fine mesh, or vice versa, may not always be an easy task.  One common
method of performing a transition is to use an intermediate belt of triangular elements as shown in
Figure 9-8(a).  It is also very tempting to selectively delete midside nodes of higher-order elements (e.g.,
CQUAD8 ) and use them as transition elements as shown in Figure 9-8(b).  This method is not recommended
because it severely distorts the stress distribution in the elements adjacent to the change in mesh size.
Figure 9-8  Transition Methods
When using a higher-order element, such as a CQUAD8  or a CHEXA  (nine to 20 nodes) for any purpose,
the general recommendation is to include all midside nodes.  A CQUAD8 element with all midside nodes
deleted is excessively stiff and therefore is inferior to a CQUAD4 .  For the CHEXA element, you should use
it with eight nodes (no midside nodes), or use it with 20 nodes (all midside nodes).  The midside nodes, if
used, should be located as close to the center of the edge as possible.
As an alternative mesh transition  method, a spline element can be used.  In MSC Nastran, the RSPLINE&lt;br&gt;
element is an elastic interpolation element that connects N end points.  Displacements for intermediate grid
points are interpolated from the equations of an elastic beam passing through these grid points.  The spline
element assumes a linear interpolation for displacement and torsion along the axis of the spline, a quadratic
interpolation for rotations normal to the axis of the spline, and a cubic interpolation for displacements
normal to the axis of the spline.
Consider an example problem as shown in Figure 9-9.  This problem involves a plate fixed at the left end with
a dimension of 14 in by 9 in, and modeled with 1 in by 1 in CQUAD4 elements.  For clarity, only grid points Q4 Q4

of interest are labeled. Five different loadings-as shown in Table 9-2 are applied to this structure along the free
edge (right end). For convenience, a RBE3 element is created along the free edge by defining a dependent
point (grid point 500) at the center. This grid point is connected to all the edge grid points. The load can
then be applied to grid point 500 and distributed to the rest of the edge grid points. See The RBE3 Element  for
a description of the RBE3 element.
Hypothetically consider that you are interested in the stresses along the line one inch from the fixed edge.
Since you are not interested in the stresses outside of this region, you can represent the rest of the region with
a coarser mesh. T wo different transition methods will be used for this purpose-one with CTRIA3s
(Figure 9-10) and one with RSPLINEs ( Figure 9-11). The transitions are performed along the line five inches
away from the fixed edge. An additional transition is performed at x = 11 inches in order to maintain the
same grid point density on the right edge for all three models. This condition assures identical load
applications for all three models. Normally, this additional transition is seldom done in a real model.

The model with the mesh transition using CTRIA3s, as shown in Figure 9-10, is quite straightforward and
needs no further explanation. However, further discussion is warranted in the case of mesh transition using
the RSPLINE element.
The input format for the RSPLINE  element is as follows:
RSPLINE
Remarks:
1.The first and last grid points must be independent.
2.Displacements are interpolated from the equations of an elastic beam passing through the grid points.
A single RSPLINE is used to connect grid points 51 through 60 as shown in Figure 9-11.  Grid points 51, 54,
57, and 60 are considered to be independent, while the other six points are dependent (grid points 52, 53,
55, 56, 58, and 59).  This RSPLINE interpolates the motions at the intermediate points, indicated by circles
in Figure 9-11 (grid points 52, 53, 55, 56, 58, and 59), from the cubic equations of a beam spline passing
through the points indicated by squares (grid points 51, 54, 57, and 60).  The input for the RSPLINE
element connecting grid points 51 through 60 is as follows:
The results using these two transition methods are compared with the baseline model with no transition.&lt;br&gt;
These results are evaluated at two locations:  at x = 1.0 in (location of interest) and at x = 5.0 in (transition
region).  The five different loading conditions mentioned previously were used.  The Hencky-von Mises&lt;br&gt;
stresses using the grid point stress feature ( Grid Point Stresses ) and the CQUAD4  corner stress option are used
for comparison. The results are shown in Figure 9-11 through Figure 9-29. As you can see, the results compare
well, using either method of transition , with the baseline model at the area of interest (away from the
transition region) for all five loading conditions.
At the transition region, depending on the loading and location, the transition using CTRIA3 elements
compares better with the baseline model in some cases, whereas the transition using RSPLINE elements
compares better with the baseline model in other cases. Note that there are only four stress values available in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

the case of using CTRIA3s since there are only four grid points along the line joining grid points 51 through
60 in Figure 9-10.
The CTRIA3 elements used in this model are all regularly shaped elements; in most real-life problems, it is
very likely that the transition areas may consist of CTRIA3 elements that are more distorted. In this case, the
transition using the distorted CTRIA3 elements does not perform as well as the model in consisting of
regularly shaped CTRIA3 elements.
In either case, there are noticeable differences in the stresses at the transition region, as expected. However,
at the area of interest and away from the transition region, the stresses are virtually the same for both cases as
compared to the baseline model. Once again, mesh transitions should always be modeled away from the area
of interest.
Mesh transition can also be made with CINTC elements for connection meshes on dissimilar edges. Contact
may also be used.&lt;/p&gt;

Mesh Transition Between Dissimilar Element Types
Attaching a plate or bar element to a solid element is a case of transition between dissimilar element types .&lt;br&gt;
This process is more involved than it appears at first glance.  Solid elements have stiffness only in the
translational DOFs  at the attachment grid points; they have no stiffness  for rotational  DOFs.  A simple&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;355 CHAPTER 9

Main Index
visualization is to think of the attachment of a solid element to a grid point as a “ball-and-socket” joint, that
is, translational forces may be transmitted, but no moment may be transmitted through the connection.
This incompatibility of the element stiffness matrices represents a modeling problem whenever plate or bar
elements are attached to solid elements.  Both plate and bar elements have stiffness for rotational DOFs
(although the plate element may not have a stiffness for the normal rotation).  Therefore, special modeling
must be performed whenever a plate or bar is connected to a solid element.  Otherwise, the connection
becomes a hinge (for plate elements) or a pinned connection (for bar elements).
Several methods are available to handle the transition  between these elements.  These methods range from
adding extra elements (for example, adding an additional plate or bar that continues into the solid element)
to using special (R-type) elements for the transition.
One method of handling this transition is to use RBE3  elements (see R-Type Constraint Elements ).  The RBE3
is an interpolation element, which is ideally suited for this application.  By using RBE3s, the rotations of the
attached grid points is simply secondary t o the translations of the adjacent grid points.  Examples of using
RBE3 elements to connect a solid element to a plate element and bar element are shown in Figure 9-17.  The
RBE3 elements attach the rotational DOFs to the translational DOFs on the solid element.

For the bar to solid connection, one RBE3 element can make the connection:
These RBE3 elements transmit the loads to the independent DOFs .  If RBE2  elements areused, then the
connection is “rigid.”
The important thing to remember when handling these connections is that the solid elements have no
stiffness  for rotational  DOFs, whereas the real structure does.  This means that a special modeling effort is
needed when any element with bending stiffness  is connected to a solid  element.
When using the RBE3 element, care must be taken to ensure that the independent DOFs are sufficient to
transfer any applied loads. A simple way to remember this is to ask, “If I constrain the DOFs that I list as
independent on the RBE3, can I prevent any possible rigid body motion?”  If the answer to this question is
“yes,” then the RBE3 element is capable of transferring any applied loads.  In this way, you can avoid possible
problems in processing the RBE3 elements.
Shell-to-Solid Transition Element (RSSCON)
The RSSCON  for modeling shell-to-solid transition eliminates the need to define RBE3s or MPCs
(multipoint constraints) to constrain a shell element’s translational and rotational degrees of freedom to a
solid element’s translational degrees of freedom. When using the RSSCON capability, the shell element mesh
must line up with the solid element mesh so that there is an exact element-to-element correspondence.RBE3 901 1 456 1.0 123 2 3

Figure 9-18  Clamped Connection of a Shell to a Solid
Through  the RSSCON Bulk Data entry, the shell elements CQUAD4, CQUAD8, CTRIA3, CTRIA6,
CQUADR, and CTRIAR can be connected to the solid elements CHEXA, CPENTA, and CTETRA.
Elements with midside nodes are also supported.
RSSCON  generates a multipoint constraint, which puts the shell degrees of freedom in the dependent set
(m-set). The three translational degrees of freedom and the two rotational degrees of freedom of the shell
edge are connected to the three translational degrees of freedom of the upper and lower solid edge. Poisson’s
ratio effects and temperature loads are modeled correctly. The generated multipoint constraints produce six
zero-energy modes for rigid-body motion.
The RSSCON Bulk Data entry defines the connection of a shell element to a solid element. Details are
described in the Bulk Data entry RSSCON  in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide . Within MSC Nastran,
however, there are two options for making this connection using the RSSCON Bulk Data entry, as shown
in Figure 9-19:
1.The ELEM option, which allows you to specify the element ID of the shell and the element ID of
the solid to which the shell is to be connected.
2.The GRID option, which allows you to specify the grid point ID of the shell and the upper and lower
grid point IDs of the solid.  Two triplets of grid point IDs may be specified on one RSSCON Bulk
Data entry.Upper Edge

Figure 9-19  ELEM and GRID Option on the RSSCON Bulk Data Entry
The best modeling practice is illustrated in Figure 9-20.  The height of the connected solid element should be
chosen equal to the thickness of the shell.  If the height of the connected solid element is much larger than
the thickness of the shell element, then the connection modeled with RSSCON will be stiffer than the
continuum model.  For example, in a mesh where shell grid points are identical or coincide with solid grid
points, the RSSCON Bulk Data entry may model a connection that is too stiff (see Figure 9-21[a]).  Note also
that in the model of Figure 9-21[b], the GRID option must be used to connect a shell element to more than
one solid element.

The only modeling requirement is that the shell grid point must lie on the line connecting the lower and
upper solid grid points.  By default, the RSSCON allows the shell grid point to have an offset from this line
of up to 5% of the distance between the two solid grid points.  If a shell grid point does not lie on the line
joining the two solid grid points, but within this 5% tolerance, the shell grid point will be moved to lie on
the line.  On the other hand, if a shell grid point lies outside this 5% tolerance, the run terminates with a fatal
message.  The default 5% tolerance can be modified by adding “param ,tolrsc, ” to the Bulk Data Section,
where  is the desired tolerance percentage.  The default value for  is 0.05.  The old and new location of

When the GRID option is used, MSC Nastran does not verify that the grid points are valid shell or solid grid
points.  When the ELEM option is used, if a solid-shell connection has horizontal edges that are curved in
the shell plane, MSC Nastran assumes that the geometry of the shell element is compatible with that of the
solid element.  In the case of vertical edges, the shell element grid point must lie on the line between the
upper and lower solid element grid point.  A default offset tolerance of 5% (user modifiable via &amp;ldquo;param,tolrsc,&lt;br&gt;
&amp;rdquo;) of the distance between the solid grid points is allowed.
By default, the moved shell grid points are not printed.
Figure 9-23  RSSCON Modeling Practice Parameters
RSSCON Modeling Recommendations
The RSSCON  connector produces excellent results if the user follows good modeling practices.  The
geometry of the RSSCON connector is checked, and fatal messages are issued for invalid connections.&lt;br&gt;
Additional recommendations are given below.
1.Midside-noded elements should only be connected to other midside-noded elements.  For example,
a CQUAD8 element connected to a CHEXA20 element is acceptable; however, a CQUAD4
element connected to a PENTA15 element is not allowed.  Elements with missing midside grid
points are not allowed.
2.For midside-noded elements, avoid using the RSSCON where shells connect to triangular solid faces.
3.Do not mix coordinate systems when using midside nodes.  In other words, when using midside
nodes, do not define a local coordinate system containing all the shell grid points and the basic
coordinate system to define the solid grid points.  Otherwise, incorrect answers will be generated.
4.Only one edge of a single shell element may connect to a solid surface.
5.Do not connect more than one shell element to one solid element when using the ELEM option.Shell 21

6.Do not attempt solid-shell connections to severely warped (greater than 20%) midside-noded solid
elements.
7.The plane of the shell element should not be parallel to the plane of the connecting face of the solid
element.
8.The connecting edge of the shell element must lie in the face of the solid element.  In addition, the
vertex grid points of the shell edge connecting to a quadrilateral solid face must line up with its
opposite edges; for triangular solid faces, the connections may be made between any of the edges. The
tolerance in the geometry may be modified; see PARAM ,TOLRSC , described above.
9.When using the ELEM option in the case of partioned superelement Bulk Data, you must ensure that
the solid element, RSSCON connector, and shell element which define a shell-solid connection are
all contained within the same superelement.
Cantilever Clamped to Wall
A cantilever (4.1 in long, 0.1 in thick, 0.5 in wide) is clamped to a wall and loaded at the tip.  This example
demonstrates how accurate the local stress distribution is when a RSSCON entry is used to model the
clamped condition.  Four different finite element models are used, and their results are compared with
classical beam theory.  The deflection and bending stress from beam theory are 0.1103 in and 9,840 psi,
respectively, at the clamped end of the cantilever.
1.The first model is a plate model consisting of all CQUAD4s. (See
Install_dir/mscxxxx /doc/linstat/quad41.dat)
2.The second model is a plate model consisting of all CHEXAs. (See
Install_dir/mscxxxx /doc/linstat/hexa1.dat)
3.The third model is a plate-solid model using MPCs to transition between the plate and solid model.
(See Install_dir/mscxxxx /doc/linstat/mpc1.dat)
4.The fourth model is a plate-solid model using RSSCONs to transition between the plate and solid
model. (See Install_dir/mscxxxx /doc/linstat/rsscon1.dat)
An exploded view of the transition used in the third and fourth models are shown in Figure 9-24. Both the
deflections and stress contours of the four models are in good agreement with the theoretical results, as shown
in Table 9-3. You might want to review the contour plots in a postprocessor.&lt;/p&gt;

Figure 9-24  Stress Distribution for CQUAD4 Model
Grid Point Stresses
When you are working with a structure that is modeled with either plate or solid  elements, it is quite
common that you may want to look at either the printed output or contour plots of the element component
stresses. If this is the case, extra care must be taken on your part to ensure that the component stresses, which
you are evaluating, are output in some consistent manner.
Consider a simple problem as shown in Figure 9-25. (See MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/plate3.dat) This
plate, which is 0.1 inch thick, is subjected to a uniaxial tensile load of 1 lb/in, and the boundary condition
is as shown in Figure 9-25. This model is represented with a 3 x 3 mesh of CQUAD4 elements. If the elements
are connected in a manner as shown in Table 9-3, then all the element x values are in the direction of the
applied loads. In this case, x = 10 psi for all nine elements. On the other hand, if you were to change, for
instance, the connectivity order for element 5 from grid points 6-7-11-10 to 7-11-10-6, the component
stresses and would be swapped. However, if you are not aware of it and you are making a contour plot  of x,
the results will be quite different for the two cases.Table 9-2  Tip Displacements and Maximum Stresses at the Clamped End

To avoid this type of surprise, it may be easier and probably more meaningful to look at the invariant stress
quantities, such as Hencky-von Mises  stresses, rather than the component stresses.  The grid point stress&lt;br&gt;
(GPSTRESS ) option in MSC Nastran offers you another alternative.  The grid point stress option calculates
the stresses at the grid points from the adjoining plate and solid elements in a coordinate system defined by
you.
This option enables you to request the output of stresses at grid points in surfaces of two-dimensional plate
elements&amp;ndash;namely, the CQUAD4 , CQUADR , CQUAD8 , CTRIA3 , CTRIAR , and CTRIA6  elements&amp;ndash;and
in volumes containing CHEXA , CPENTA , and CTETRA  solid elements.
By default, stresses are output at the center of each of these elements and also at the vertices of the CQUADR ,
CQUAD4  (with corner option), CQUAD8 , CTRIAR , and CTRIA6 shell elements as well as the CHEXA ,
CPENTA , and CTETRA  solid elements.  This default output is not universally satisfactory because in the
case concerning the surfaces of the CQUAD4 (without corner output request) and/or CTRIA3 elements,
you often have a requirement for more accurate stress values at the grid points.  However, the vertex stresses
generated for these elements that connect to a common grid point are often not identical.  These deviations
are most pronounced with a crude model and converge as the model becomes more detailed.  The option
described in this section provides a rational method that yields reasonable and unique stresses at each vertex
grid point in surfaces or volumes defined by you.
Description of the Grid Point Stress Method
A scheme to interpolate and/or extrapolate over a surface or volume from a known set of stresses (the element
stresses) requires that these known stress components be transformed into a consistent coordinate system
prior to averaging these stress values.  This coordinate system is defined by you, and it should be generally
compatible with the surface of interest in order to obtain accurate grid point stresses.  Generally, such a
coordinate system is the natural coordinate system that you used in the generation of the model of the surface
or volume in question or the basic coordinate system.  Calculated grid point stress components are output
in this coordinate system, which is called the output coordinate system of the surface or volume.  This CQUAD4,4,1,5,6,10,9

coordinate system should not be confused with the output coordinate system (CD field) as defined on the
grid entries.
Each stress component (e.g., x ) is treated independently of other stress components in the calculation of
average grid point stress components. The stress invariants at grid points (i.e., principal stresses, the Hencky-
von Mises  stress, and the mean pressure) are evaluated from the average values of the stress components at
grid points.  The grid point stress components are output in the output coordinate system of the surface.
T wo methods are used to calculate grid point stress components for plate  and shell  elements-namely,
topological  and geometric , with topological as the default method.  The topological method involves the
averaging of stresses at a grid point due to the contribution of the elements directly attached to this grid point.&lt;br&gt;
This contribution does not include the effect of the element size.  On the other hand, the geometric method
accounts for the element size based on the numerical technique of least squares.  If the results are substantially
different when using the two different methods, it may be an indication that your model is not fine enough.&lt;br&gt;
In general, if your model is fine enough to capture the stress gradients, the two methods should yield similar
results.
A single, simplified, topological method is used to calculate grid point stress components in volumes
containing solid elements.  However, prior to a discussion of these methods, it is necessary to define the four
categories into which grid points are divided.  These definitions are important for CQUAD4 (without corner
output option) and CTRIA3 elements since the stress averaging method used depends on the type of grid
point.  However, they have very little meaning for CQUAD8, CTRIA6, and CQUAD4 (with corner output&lt;br&gt;
option) since the stress averaging is performed the same way regardless of the type of grid points for elements
with vertex stresses.
Interior grid points
Grid points that are connected only to interior line segments, i.e., line segments that are coincident
with the edges of two or more elements.  If the model in Figure 9-25 is used as an example, grid points
6, 7, 10, and 11 are considered as the interior grid points.
Corner grid points
Grid points that are only connected to a single element.  For example, in the model in Figure 9-25,
grid points 1, 4, 13, and 16 are considered as the corner grid points.
Edge grid points
Grid points that are connected to both interior and exterior line segments.  An exterior line segment
is coincident with the edge of only one element.  For example, in the model in Figure 9-25, grid
points 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 12, 14, and 15 are considered as the edge grid points.
Exception grid points
Grid points at which discontinuities in stress can occur.  Exception grid points are discussed later in
this chapter.
Stresses at interior , corner , or edge  grid points are considered to be continuous between directly connected
elements.  Stresses at exception points may be discontinuous between connected elements and, as will be seen,
a different grid point stress may be output for each of the connected elements.  Engineering judgment must
be exercised in assessing the validity of grid point stresses at exception points.  Note that the classification of
the grid point types is performed automatically by MSC Nastran based on their connectivities.&lt;/p&gt;

Topological Method - Plate Elements and Solid Elements
The topological  method for the evaluation of grid point stresses only recognizes the existence of interior,
edge, and corner points, i.e., exception points are not considered as a distinct category of grid points
(exception grid points arise as a result of geometrical rather than topological characteristics).  The relations
used to compute the average grid point stresses in the surfaces of the plate elements by the topological method
are described in Table 9-5.  The relations used to compute the average grid point stresses in the volumes
containing solid elements are described in Table 9-5.  The topological method is the default method.

In the geometric method, grid point stresses for points that connect to CQUAD8 , CTRIA6 , and/or
CQUAD4  (with corner output request) elements use the average of the element corner stresses.  If CQUAD4
(without corner output  request) or CTRIA3 elements connect to these points, their influence is not
considered.  The geometric method for the determination of average grid point stresses that connect only to
CQUAD4/CTRIA3  elements utilizes the numerical technique of least squares.
Treatment of Exception Points
Exception points are defined as grid points at which stress discontinuities may occur.  Such discontinuities
may occur due to a substantial difference in slope between adjacent elements directly connected to the same
line segment or if more than two elements are directly connected to the same line segment. Figure 9-26 is an
example of such a situation.  Grid points 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are examples of exception grid points.

Note that this situation is geometric rather than topological in nature and is, therefore, only considered under
the geometric interpolation option.
Since exception points are defined as grid points at which stress discontinuities may exist, it is conceivable
that a computed average grid point stress  at an exception point may be different for each of the directly
connected elements.  However, it is more common to find that a subset of the elements, which are directly
connected to an exception point, forms a subsurface on which stresses may be considered to be continuous.&lt;br&gt;
A unique average grid point stress may then be computed for the elements of the subsurface.  For the problem
shown in Figure 9-26, you may consider creating two subsurfaces-one subsurface consisting of elements within
the shaded surface and another subsurface consisting of elements within the unshaded surface.&lt;br&gt;
The calculation of average grid point stresses for a subsurface that contains two or more elements is
performed when the geometric interpolation method is used for edge points.  If a subsurface consists of a
single element, the calculation of an average grid point stress is performed in the same manner as utilized in
the calculation of average grid point stresses at corner points.  It must be noted, however, that D, E1, and
E2 may be interior, exterior, or corner points (see Table 9-5).
As stated previously, each element stress component (independently of all other stress components) is
transformed into the output coordinate system before averaging.  It is necessary that this output coordinate
system  vary slowly over the surface in order for the interpolated stresses to be accurate.  This approach is
certainly valid for stress interpolation over elements that are in a common plane, and it should be adequate
for engineering analysis when the difference in slope between adjacent elements is small.  If this slope is not
small, it is suggested that you break them into multiple surfaces or volumes.  When the elements do vary
substantially from a smooth surface, you must utilize engineering judgment relative to the accuracy of the
resultant stress data.
Average grid point stresses are only computed at element vertices.  For elements with mid-edge grid points,
you can estimate the stresses at these mid-edge grid points to be the average of the computed stresses at the
grid point at the ends of the edge in question.
Grid Point Stress Interface
A sample of the grid point stress data recovery option is shown in this section.
Case Control Section
The following Case Control commands are used by the grid point stresses:
GPSTRESS (Case) Requests grid point stresses output.
STRFIELD (Case) Requests grid point stresses for graphical postprocessing and stress discontinuities.
STRESS  (Case)  or
ELSTRESSRequests element stress output.
OUTPUT
(Case) (POST)Delimiter.
SET (Case) Defines a set of elements that define a surface or volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Linear Statics Analysis User’s Guide
Grid Point Stresses372
Main Index
In static analysis, place the GPSTRESS  command above the subcase level or in individual subcases.  If the
GPSTRESS command is above the subcase level, it is utilized by all subcases and subcoms unless overridden
by a GPSTRESS command in a subcase or subcom.
Note that if grid point stress data is desired, an ELSTRESS (or STRESS) request for all elements in the
surfaces or volumes of interest must be included in the Case Control Section.  This request is in addition to
the GPSTRESS request.  Such requests cause the output of element stress data as well as grid point stress data.&lt;br&gt;
If the printed output of element stress data is not desired, the requests “ELSTRESS(PLOT) = x” or
“STRESS(PLOT) = x” may be used.  In the model shown in Figure 9-25, if grid point stresses are requested
for grid point 11, then element stresses must be requested for a set that includes at least elements 5, 6, 8, and
9.  Furthermore, the set of elements in the SURFACE definition must also include elements 5, 6, 8, and 9.&lt;br&gt;
In this example, if one of the elements that is connected to grid point 11 (e.g., element 6) is left out in the
SET definition, then User Warning Message 4621 is issued.  The GPSTRESS values calculated in this case
may be meaningless.
The OUTPUT(POST) section of the Case Control Section contains specific requests for grid point stress
data for the surfaces or volumes of elements.  Any number of element surfaces or volumes may be defined,
but only those surfaces or volumes referenced through the GPSTRESS command will have grid point stress
data generated and output.
Bulk Data Section
If postprocessing of grid point stress is desired, the parameter PARAM, POST,x is needed in the Bulk Data
Section.  There is no other special requirement.
Again, the model in Figure 9-25 is used for this illustration.  In this case, you may want to have two separate
surfaces.  The first surface contains elements 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8; the second surface contains all elements. Part
of the input file is shown. (See Install_dir/mscxxxx //doc/linstat/gpstress.dat)

In the above example, surface 100 contains elements 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8 that were referenced by set 1.  Surface
200 contains all of the elements that were referenced by set 2.  The element positive normal is in the direction
of the z-axis of the basic coordinate system .  By default, the grid point stresses are transformed to the basic
coordinate system.  The grid point stresses are called out by the GPSTRESS  command, which points to set
10, which, in turn, points to surfaces 100 and 200.  Element stresses are requested for all of the elements, SURFACE Defines a surface of plate elements referenced by the SET command.
VOLUME Defines a volume of solid elements referenced by the SET command.&lt;/p&gt;

which, of course, encompass elements 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8.  The STRFIELD command is required to generate
postprocessing data for your graphic package.  A partial output of a typical grid point stress is provided below.
The above example is idealized in that each surface is flat. Consider the general case illustrated by Figure 9-27
below. When using a specified coordinate system (default=Basic), the designated AXIS (default X1=X) is
projected onto the surfaced defined by the SURFACE entry. The NORMAL (default=R) is only used to
define the normal to the surface and reverse it if requested, which then gives the in-plane Y direction based
on the right-hand-rule. The stresses are then averaged at each grid after being transformed to this consistent
coordinate system and the resulting averaged stress is still a 2D tensor in the plane of the surface. Of course
some tricky things are done when the normal of the adjacent elements differ slightly and you can use the
TOPO or GEOM methods to take this into account.

So referring to Figure 9-27
1.The curved surface represents all the elements in SURFACE 2 defined by SET 10 case control
(OUTPUT(POST)).
2.The red vectors show a typical element coordinate system at the centroid with X being in the plane
of the element and is the X  stress direction of the element.  N is the normal to the element.
3.These vectors (at the integration points) are extrapolated to the nodes and contributions from
adjacent elements are used to create the local surface for a particular grid based on the actual normal
vector determined by the TOPO or GEOM methods.
4.The stresses from each element are transformed into the projected coordinate system specified. In this
case CORD 15.
5.The black vectors represent COORD 15, where AXIS is specified as X2 (or the Y-Axis) of COORD
15.
6.This axis is projected on to the surface and becomes the X-Axis direction of the consistent coordinate
system to which the stresses are transformed.
7.In this example the NORMAL is defined as the X3 (or Z-axis) of COORD 15.
8.So N15 x X15s (cross product) gives the Y-axis of the consistent coordinate system.
9.Stresses are then averaged properly based on this consistent coordinate system.
Consistent Loading
In finite element analysis, the loads are often applied to the elements rather than to the grid points.  Examples
of such loadings include the edge load on a CQUAD4 element or a pressure load on one of the faces of a solid
element.
When you convert these element loads to grid point loads , a common tendency is to spread them equally at
the connected grid points.  Let us look at an example of a typical plate element with uniform in-plane loading
at one of the edges as shown in Figure 9-28.  The total load ( P) is to be uniformly distributed along the edge
of the element with an intensity of P/l, where l is the length of the edge.  This same load is to be applied to
six different elements-CQUAD4 , CTRIA3 , CQUAD8 , CTRIA6 , CQUADR , and CTRIAR .  If you lump
these loads equally to the grid points, the load at each node is P/2 for the CQUAD4, CTRIA3, CQUADR
and CTRIAR, and P/3 for the CQUAD8 and CTRIA6.  Since the geometry and boundary condition are
identical for the six models, and the loads are “seemingly equivalent,” you will expect the results
(displacements, stresses, etc.) to be identical.  However, in general, this is not the case.  The results for the
cases using CQUAD8, CTRIA6, CQUADR, and CTRIAR are different from the results using CQUAD4
and CTRIA3.  The reason for this is because these “seemingly equivalent” loads are actually not quite
equivalent.  They are considered as lumped loads.  In order to obtain the correct load distribution, these loads
need to be converted to consistent loads.
The equivalent loads at the grid points computed from the element loads are known as consistent loads , and
they are calculated by applying the principle of virtual work.  The same shape function that is used in deriving
the element stiffness is used for arriving at this load-and hence the word consistent load.  They are a function
of the element types and the applied loads.  Depending on the element, these lumped loads in general are not
equal to the consistent loads.  The consistent loads for each of these elements for a uniform in-plane edge&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;375 CHAPTER 9

load of P/l are shown next to each element.  In this case, the lumped loads and consistent loads are the same
for the CQUAD4 and CTRIA3.  They are not the same for the CQUAD8, CTRIA6, CQUADR and
CTRIAR.  As you can see, they are substantially different from the lumped loads that were discussed in the
previous paragraph.  It is interesting to note that the loads are distributed as 1/6, 4/6, and 1/6 along the edge
for the CQUAD8 and CTRIA6, which is quite different from the lumped load approach.  For the CQUADR
and CTRIAR, an additional moment Pl/12 is needed to arrive at the consistent loads.  When the
corresponding consistent loads shown in Figure 9-28 are applied to each of the respective elements, the force
distributions are then equivalent for all the elements.

Consider another example with solid elements .  A load P is to be applied evenly as an outward pressure load
(P/A) to a surface of each of the four solid elements shown in Figure 9-29.  Again, if you lump these loads
equally to the grid points, the lumped load at each node is P/4 for the CHEXA  (with eight nodes) and
CPENTA  (with six nodes), and P/8 for the CHEXA (with 20 nodes) and CPENTA (with 15 nodes).  The
consistent loads are shown in Figure 9-29.  The consistent and lumped loads are the same for the CHEXA
(with eight nodes) and the CPENTA (with six nodes) for this case.  The consistent loads  for the CHEXA
(with 20 nodes) and CPENTA (with 15 nodes) are shown in Figure 9-29(c) and Figure 9-29(d), respectively.&lt;br&gt;
The load distribution along each edge is -.0833 P, .3333 P and -.08333 P, or a -1/4/-1 ratio, which is quite
counter intuitive, especially for the sign change.  Fortunately, you do not have to calculate this consistent load&lt;br&gt;
for the pressure load .  This consistent load is generated automatically inside MSC Nastran by using the
PLOAD4  entry.

As you can see, consistent loads are functions of the element types and applied loads.
Symmetry
When you think of a symmetrical structure, you most likely think of a structure that has one or more planes
of reflective symmetry.  Although there are other kinds of symmetry  available in MSC Nastran, reflective
symmetry is the only type that is discussed in this section.  MSC Nastran also provides a series of special
solution sequences that automates some of these other types of analyses.  They are known as the cyclic
symmetry  features and are covered in Cyclic Symmetry .  If a structure is symmetric, then the size of your finite
element model can be reduced, which, in turn, reduces the time and cost of your analysis.  For each plane of
symmetry  that you have in your model, the model size can be reduced by a factor of approximately two.
Figure 9-30(a) and Figure 9-30(b) illustrate structures that contain one and two planes of symmetry,
respectively.  In the first case, only half the model needs to be represented.  In the second case, only a quarter
of the model needs to be represented.
Figure 9-30  Structures with Planes of Symmetry
If the loads applied to the structure are symmetric relative to the plane of symmetry, then the full model can
be replaced with half the model by applying a symmetric boundary condition.  On the other hand, if the
loads are antisymmetric, the same simplification can be achieved by applying the antisymmetric boundary
condition.
A symmetric boundary condition implies that the displacements normal to the plane of symmetry and
rotations about the axes in the plane of symmetry are zero at the plane of symmetry.  An antisymmetric
boundary condition implies that the displacements in the plane of symmetry and rotations normal to the
plane of symmetry are zero at the plane of symmetry.
Any general loading condition can be broken into a combination of symmetric and antisymmetric loads
relative to the plane of symmetry.  You can work through an example of applying symmetry using the model
in Figure 9-31(a).  This load can be broken into two separate loads as shown in Figure 9-31(b) and Figure 9-31(c).Plane of

Using the Finite Element Method
Before discussing the specifics of the finite element method using MSC Nastran, it is useful to examine how
you might use the finite element method to solve an engineering problem. The discussion in this section is
quite general and is not meant to show you the specifics of generating and running a finite element computer
model. Rather, the purpose of this discussion is give you some insight into how and why you would use the
finite element method.
The finite element method  is used in a wide variety of disciplines and engineering applications. One of the
most common applications of the method is to solve structural analysis problems. T raditionally, structural
analysis applications are divided into two areas-static and dynamic analyses. Performing structural analysis
using the finite element analysis is no exception. It is not unusual to find individuals who spend the majority
of their time performing static finite element analysis and little or no time performing dynamic analysis .
Likewise, it is common to find individuals who spend the majority of their time performing dynamic analysis.
This guide deals exclusively with static analysis, whereas the MSC Nastran Dynamic Analysis User’s Guide  is available
for those who are interested in dynamic analysis. However, you should find the material in this guide
worthwhile regardless of your specialty area.
When performing static analysis  using the finite element method, the structure is represented as a collection
of discrete elements. Think of these elements as building blocks from which you can construct a model of the
actual structure. Using the properties of these individual building blocks (the elements), the stiffness of the
whole structure is approximated. The loads on the structure are represented as forces acting on the elements
or on the boundary of the elements.
To use the finite element method effectively, you must apply your engineering knowledge to the structure
being analyzed. Next you must decide how much detail to put in your model, i.e., the size and number of
elements. More detail in the model results in a more accurate solution but it costs more in terms of computer
resources. The goal is to create an accurate, yet cost-effective model. The better your understanding of the
structure, the applied loads, and the MSC Nastran solution process, the more effective you will be in finding
solutions to your problems.
Suppose you have to design a circular tube as shown in Figure 1-1 and you are considering using
MSC Nastran.The tube has an outer diameter of 20 mm and a wall thickness of 0.5 mm. The tube is attached
at both ends to a thick bracket which is fixed rigidly to the wall. Both the tube and the bracket are made of
aluminum. The loading consists of a transverse force of 1000 N acting on a ring 10 mm in width located in
the center of the tube.

Introduction

Figure 1-1  Thin Walled Tube with a Transverse Load
Before starting a computer model, ask the following questions:
1.What are the load paths  for this structure?  Knowing the load path for the structure provides insight
regarding what part of the structure needs to be modeled in detail.  Furthermore, knowing how the
loads are transmitted to the structure helps you to understand and verify the results.
2.What is our design criteria?  You may be concerned that the applied load causes local yielding of the
material, or yielding may be a secondary concern and your main concern may be deflection.  Another
concern may be that of the tube buckling.  The answer to these questions dictates how much detail
is needed in your model.
3.If yielding is of concern, where are the higher stresses expected to occur, and what failure criteria
should be used?
4.Is the structure displacement considered small?  If the displacement is not small compared to the
dimensions of the tube, is it necessary to perform a nonlinear analysis?  Planning ahead as to what
additional analyses may be necessary can reduce the time necessary to convert the input file to a
nonlinear analysis if needed.
5.How can the results of the finite element analysis be verified?  In other words, what independent
checks can be made to ensure that the answers are reasonable?
Returning to the tube structure, assume that the primary design criteria are to have an adequate margin-of-
safety and a critical buckling load that is at least three times the applied load.
The load for this structure consists of a force applied to the stiff ring at the center.  The stiff ring prevents the
tube from crushing locally where the force is applied.  From the geometry of the tube, you expect the
displacement and stress distribution to be similar to that of a classical fixed-fixed beam with a center load.&lt;br&gt;
A good first step in any analysis is to estimate the output quantities that you are trying to determine.  In the
example, the output quantities are the stresses and displacements of the tube.  Assuming that the tube behaves
as a classical beam, then the stresses and displacements can be found using standard engineering formulas.&lt;br&gt;
Once you have an estimate, you can identify modeling errors quickly.  For many engineering problems, you
cannot look in a handbook for a formula.  However, you can always make some simplifying assumptions and
obtain a crude estimate.  Having a good estimate, simplifies the model checkout.
For the structure, the maximum stress and displacement are estimated to be 429 N/mm2 and 2.24 mm,
respectively (using standard engineering formulas).  If the finite model results are substantially different from
these values, further investigation is warranted
Now you are ready to generate the finite element model.  At this point, you need to decide what kind of
elements should be used and how much detail is needed.
If the tube structure acts like a beam-that is, plane sections remain plane and the neutral plane remains strain
free-then the structure can be modeled using the CBAR  one-dimensional elements as shown in Figure 1-2.&lt;/p&gt;

Figure 1-2  Deformed Shape of the Tube Structure Modeled with CBAR Elements
To model the structure with CBAR elements, divide the tube into several short sections along the length of
the tube.  Each of the short sections is represented as a single CBAR element.  The CBAR elements are
connected to their neighbor elements at points known as grid points.  The physical locations of the grid
points determine the length of each of the CBAR elements.  Associated with each of the CBAR elements is
a property entry with the following properties:  the cross-sectional area, two area moments of inertia, and a
torsional constant.  The properties represent the physical properties of the tube and must be entered for each
element.  The material properties&amp;ndash;consisting of the modulus of elasticity and Poisson’s ratio&amp;ndash;are entered on
a material entry.
T wenty-five elements are chosen primarily for plotting purposes.  If less elements are used, the maximum
stress will be the same, but the deformed shape will not be as smooth (this is true only for simple 1-D
elements).  T o represent the stiff ring at the center, the CBAR element at the center is given the same length
as the ring width, and the properties of the elements in this section are chosen to represent a very stiff section.
The results of the one-dimensional CBAR model are similar to those generated with the hand calculation-
the maximum stress is 429 N/mm2 and the center deflection is 2.34 mm. The deflection of the tube is slightly
larger for the finite element model (2.34 versus 2.24) because shear flexibility is included in the finite element
model.
Having reviewed the results of the CBAR model, suppose you think that the thin tube may bend such that
the beam theory is no longer a valid assumption. If the structure cannot be modeled using beam theory, a
more detailed model is required such as the one shown in Figure 1-3. As can be seen, the tube is treated as a
curved surface as opposed to the beam model shown in Figure 1-2. The surface is modeled using two-
dimensional elements with each element attached to its neighboring elements at the discrete grid points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21 CHAPTER 1
Introduction

Figure 1-3  Deformed Shape of Coarse CQUAD4 Element Model
This concept of representing the real world structure with finite elements is generally referred to as meshing.&lt;br&gt;
Hence, you can say that the tube structure is meshed with CQUAD4  elements.  For most models, meshing
is performed with the use of a preprocessor such as Patran.  The relative number of elements used to represent
the structure or part of a structure is commonly referred to as mesh density .  As the mesh density is increased,
more elements are needed and the size of the elements is decreased.  The process of increasing the mesh
density to improve the accuracy of the results is also referred to as refining the model. Figure 1-4 shows the
tube model being refined from the 400 elements shown in Figure 1-3 to 3104 elements.

&lt;em&gt;Includes transverse shear flexibility.
Now consider the second part of our design criteria:  buckling .  Using your knowledge of the structure, you
know that if the structure buckles, it will most likely do so by crippling the thin wall of the tube.  This type
of buckling cannot be predicted using the CBAR model.  You need to use a two-dimensional model in which
surfaces are capable of representing the buckled shape.  The question is:  how much detail is needed in a mesh?
Using the coarse CQUAD4 model shown in Figure 1-3, the critical buckling load is calculated to be 37,280
N.  The corresponding buckled shape is shown in Figure 1-5.
Figure 1-5  Buckled Shape Using the Coarse CQUAD4 Model
Using the refined CQUAD4 model shown in Figure 1-4, the critical buckling load is 23,757 N, which is
substantially less than the predicted value using the coarse model.  The corresponding buckled shape is shown
in Figure 1-6.Table 1-1  Maximum Stress and Displacement for the Tube Structure

Introduction

Figure 1-6  Buckled Shape Using the Fine CQUAD4 Model
The reason for the lower predicted critical load is found in Figure 1-6.  The buckled shapes shown in Figure 1-5
and Figure 1-6 are very different.  The buckled shape for the coarse model looks like an overall crushing of the
tube, which is not what you would expect.  The buckled shape for the fine model shows localized crippling
around in the vicinity of the loaded stiff ring.  The coarse model is simply not detailed enough to adequately
represent the buckled shape of the thin shell structure.
Returning to our original design goals, which model is best for this project?  If you are only interested in the
stresses and displacement for the single load, as shown in Figure 1-1, then the CBAR model&amp;ndash;even the hand
calculation&amp;ndash;will suffice.  If, however, the applied load is more complex (for example, a torsional load), then
the coarse model is useful because the stress pattern is more complex.  Also, the CQUAD4  element stress
output includes the von Mises  stresses that can be useful in your failure analysis.
If buckling is a concern, a fine mesh is required.  In fact, even the fine mesh shown in Figure 1-5 is not
adequate as can be seen by inspecting the buckled region.  This buckled region must have several elements
per wavelength and must not have the sharp edges between the elements.  Whenever you see the sharp edges,
you need to further refine the model to see if the critical load or the buckled shape changes significantly.
As a final comment on this example, if after refining the model to get a reasonable buckled shape, you find
the critical load close to the applied load, you probably would want to run a nonlinear analysis including
both material and geometric nonlinearity.
When you model a region with a particular element, note that you are approximating the actual stiffness in
that region with the stiffness of the element that you have chosen.  These finite elements , which are
commonly referred to as simply “elements,” can be scalar elements or one-dimensional elements (such as the
CBAR element), two-dimensional elements (such as the CQUAD4 element), or three-dimensional elements.&lt;br&gt;
All of the MSC Nastran linear elements are discussed in CHAPTER .
It is your responsibility to choose the appropriate element types and number of elements to obtain the best
results.  If you use a one-dimensional element to model a two-dimensional plate structure, you can expect
poor results.  If, on the other hand, you choose a two-dimensional element type for your plate structure, the
approximation will be considerably better.  This choice requires engineering judgment.  It is easy to use a
graphics preprocessor to generate a good-looking model of your structure that contains many elements, but&lt;/p&gt;

the model can be a poor model for the analysis.  This problem is further compounded by the fact that today’s
postprocessors can take the most meaningless results and present them in a very convincing manner.
Having examined how the finite element method can be used in an engineering project, now look at the steps
a finite element program, such as MSC Nastran, follows in solving a very simple model.  This is the subject
of the next section.
A Simple Problem
In the last section, a sample engineering problem was presented that showed how a MSC Nastran model can
fit an engineering project; however, there was no discussion of the internal processing.  In this section, the
finite method is discussed from the opposite point of view, namely, an examination of the steps performed
by MSC Nastran to solve a linear statics problem.  T o keep the equations to a reasonable size, a simple two-
element model is used.  A larger model will not help in understanding the method; it will only add complexity
in the relationships between the physical structure and the equations.
Figure 1-7 shows the basic steps that MSC Nastran follows when solving a linear statics analysis .  As shown in
the figure, you develop a model of your structure by dividing your structure into small but discrete elements.
Each element is connected to its neighboring elements at the grid points  (commonly referred to as “nodes”
in many textbooks).  Typically, you lay out the pattern of grid points first and connect the grid points by the
elements, remembering that both the location of the grid points and the number of grid points determine the
size and number of elements in your model. Associated with each of the grid points in the model are six
components of motion-namely, the translations and rotations in the three perpendicular directions (e.g., the
X, Y, Z, RX, RY and RZ directions). These components of motion are referred to as “degrees of freedom .”&lt;br&gt;
The collection of all of the degrees of freedom in your model make up the global displacement set.
Connected between the grid points are the elements. The stiffness of each element is represented internally
in matrix form, commonly referred to as the “element stiffness matrix.” The size of the element stiffness
matrix is dependent on the element type.  The terms in the element stiffness matrix are based on user input
such as the material type, the element properties, and the element geometry. The element geometry is
determined by the location of the grid points to which the element is connected.&lt;br&gt;
All of the element stiffness matrices are assembled into a single matrix called the “global stiffness matrix.”&lt;br&gt;
This global stiffness matrix represents the total structural stiffness before the boundary conditions are
considered; therefore, the global stiffness matrix is, in general, a singular matrix.  The physical meaning of a
singular stiffness matrix is that the whole structure or part of the structure can displace as a free body without
producing any internal forces in the members.
In static analysis, adequate boundary conditions must be applied to the model in order to prevent any rigid
body motion of your structure. If the specified boundary conditions do not adequately constrain the model
in all directions, the structure’s stiffness matrix remains singular and the run terminates with an error message.&lt;br&gt;
Once the boundary conditions are applied to the model appropriately, the global stiffness matrix is reduced
to a nonsingular stiffness matrix representing the constrained structure.
All of the loads that you apply to the model are combined to form the load vector. These applied loads can
be in the form of point forces and moments applied directly to the grid points, line loads applied along the
length of one-dimensional elements, surface loads applied to two- and three-dimensional elements, or body
loads such as gravity.  These different load types may be combined to form a single load vector, which is the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;25 CHAPTER 1
Introduction
Main Index
same as saying that the loads are applied simultaneously.  You also have the option of applying multiple load
vectors within a single run.
After the constrained stiffness matrix and the load vector are generated, the static equilibrium matrix
equation given by Equation (1-1) is solved as follows:
[K]{u} = {p} (1-1)
where:
The unknowns in Equation (1-1) are the displacements {u} a t the grid points in the model.  Determining the
displacements involves the equivalent of inverting the stiffness matrix [K] a nd multiplying it by the force
vector [p].  Actually, the process of inverting a matrix is too time consuming; therefore, a process based on
the Gauss elimination method is used.  The resulting displacements are the same&amp;ndash;the solution process is just
faster.
Once the displacements at the grid points are known, any desired outputs, such as element forces, strains,
and stresses, are computed using those displacements on an element-by-element basis.  You can control what
type of output is generated and whether the output is printed, punched to a file, or plotted.[K] =system stiffness

Following the procedure shown in Figure 1-7:
1.Represent the structure as three grid points connected by two discrete elements.
This structure can be effectively modeled using two simple one-dimensional elements.  For this
example, one-dimensional elements with two degrees of freedom are sufficient.  The simple element
used in this example is similar to the MSC Nastran CROD element described in the next chapter but
without the torsional stiffness.  Using the CBAR element for this example is acceptable; however, the
element matrices are larger without providing any additional insight.
The first task involves assigning identification numbers to the elements (element IDs) and to the grid
points (grid point IDs) as shown in Figure 1-9.L 10 inches =

The element stiffness matrix for our one-dimensional element is given by Equation (1-2).

Using the cross-sectional area [A], Young’s modulus E, and the length L for each element in Equation

The two elemental stiffness matrices are assembled together by simply combining the matrices at the

4.Apply the fixed boundary condition to grid point 1, which is attached to ground.&lt;br&gt;
Apply the fixed boundary condition by constraining grid point 1.  This constraint is accomplished by
partitioning row 1 and column 1 out of the assembled global stiffness matrix as shown in Equation
(1-5).  Partitioning the matrix is achieved by removing rows and columns from one matrix to create
a smaller matrix.

The total load on the structure consists of the 10000 pound acting at grid point 3 as shown in
Figure 1-8.  Note that the reaction force at grid point 1 is not an applied load and is not included in
the loading vector.  The constrained degree of freedom (grid point 1) is partitioned out of the load
vector in the same manner that it is partitioned out of the global stiffness matrix as shown in Equation
(1-6).
(1-6)
6.Solve the matrix equation.
The resulting matrix equation and solution is given by Equation (1-7).
(1-7)
Solving the matrix equation yields the displacement at grid points 2 and 3.  Combining the
displacement of grid point 1 (which is 0.0 because it is constrained) to the other grid points yields
the complete displacement vector for the entire model as shown in Equation (1-8).

Therefore, the stresses are -5000 psi and -6667 psi for members 1 and 2, respectively.
Although this is a very simple model, it does demonstrate the approach followed by all static solutions. The

Introduction to Organization of MSC Nastran Files
This chapter describes the basic approach to analyzing a structure using MSC Nastran.  The example used
throughout this chapter is a simple two-dimensional truss.  Although the truss structure is relatively simple
compared to the typical structures analyzed using MSC Nastran, it is a structure that most engineers
recognize.
The best way to learn a new feature is by applying it to an example.  You are encouraged to copy the files
presented in this guide into your working directories and experiment with them.  Do not spend time entering
the input files from the listings shown.  For most of the examples in this guide, only a partial listing is
provided.  The partial listing serves two purposes: first, it keeps the examples down to a reasonable size;
second, it is easier to highlight the important points for that particular example.  The complete input files
can be found on the delivery media, in the MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat directory.
Parameter Discussion
Parameters are used throughout MSC Nastran to provide the user with controls over many aspects of the
solution. They are powerful tools for setting corporate, section, or user defaults. Each solution sequence is
designed with a specific set of default values and solution paths. In the majority of the cases, the default values
have been found well suited for most models. There are occasions, however, when you may want to deviate
from the default values.
There are multiple ways of setting parameters for MSC Nastran. For the NASTRAN Statement they are set
by the rc file and the execution statement. (See the Configuring the Runtime Environment  (Ch. A) in the MSC
Nastran Installation and Operations Guide and the  (Ch. 1) in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide ). For
the Case Control and Bulk Data Section the selection is extensive and controls for a parameter can come from
each section. (See Parameters  in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide ). For the advanced users, there is also
the DMAP (Direct Matrix Abstraction Program) module language. (See the MSC Nastran DMAP
Programmer’s Guide)
The majority of the parameters referenced in this guide are Case Control or Bulk Data parameters. These will
be the ones controlling default tolerances or controls for the type and amount of output. Depending on the
parameter, it can be specified either as a PARAM Bulk Data entry and/or a PARAM Case Control command.
(See Parameter Applicability Tables  in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide ) The format of each is as follows:
PARAM,xname,xvalue where xname and xvalue are the name and value of the PARAMeter, respectively, such
as PARAM,WTMASS,0.00259, for the terms of the structural mass matrix to be multiplied by the value of
this parameter when they are generated. Or PARAM,POST ,-1 to output data for the Patran Post Processor.
Overview of the MSC Nastran Input File
The purpose of this section is provide an overview of the input; it is not meant to describe all of the options
available for static analysis. The next section provides an overview of the output files. The goal of these two
sections is to show how a typical MSC Nastran input file is used to represent a typical model.
To perform an analysis using MSC Nastran, you must generate an input file  describing the structure’s
geometry, material properties, boundary conditions, and loads. In addition to defining the physical structure,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;33 CHAPTER 2
Organization of MSC Nastran Files
Main Index
the input file also specifies the type of analysis to be performed and other pertinent information. The input
file is a text file (ASCII) which can be created using any text editor or one of the many preprocessors that
interface with MSC Nastran.
After the generation of the input file is complete, it is submitted for execution as a batch process
(MSC Nastran is not an interactive program). Once the input file has been submitted, you have no
additional interaction with MSC Nastran until the job is complete. The only exception is to terminate the
job prior to completion if it becomes necessary.
To illustrate the form of input and output files, you can use the simple truss structure shown in Figure 2-1.
Figure 2-1  Truss Example
The truss structure consists of five members, each with a cross-sectional area (A) of 4 in2 and a polar moment
of inertia (J) of 1.27 in4.  The material is steel with a Young’s modulus E of 30 x106 psi and a Poisson’s ratio
of 0.3.  All the connections between the members are pin joints (i.e., they can transmit forces but not
moments).  The goal of the analysis is to determine the displacement of the grid points and the stresses and
forces within the members.
The MSC Nastran input file listing for the truss structure is given in Listing 2-1. (See
MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/truss1.dat.) Although the input file shown represents a fairly simple structure,
it is typical of all MSC Nastran input files.  The purpose of the example is not to show how to perform an
analysis or discuss the specifics of the model, such as the grid points or elements.  Rather, the purpose is to
present the form of the input file itself.  Discussion of the actual commands and entries in the input file
begins in Grid Points, Scalar Points, and Coordinate Systems .4Y

&lt;p&gt;35 CHAPTER 2
Organization of MSC Nastran Files
Main Index
Case Control Section is referred to as a command; and input in the Bulk Data Section is referred to as an
entry.
Following are descriptions of these sections.
The NASTRAN Statement
The NASTRAN statement  is an optional statement used to specify system parameters that control internal
solution processing or provide specific diagnostics.  The NASTRAN statement, if used, must be placed
before the Executive Control Statement.  The NASTRAN statement is generally not required, but it is useful
when you need to specify system-related parameters, such as setting the BUFFSIZE  for the I/O.  For a
description of the NASTRAN statement options, refer to the Executing MSC Nastran  in the MSC Nastran Quick
Reference Guide .  Some of the NASTRAN statement options are discussed in Database Management .
File Management Section
The File Management Section (FMS) , if needed, is located before the Executive Control Section. The
purpose of the FMS is to assign files, manipulate the database, and perform restarts.  It is commonly used
when solving larger problems.  Restarts  and Database Management  discuss the use of the File Management
Section.  Since the truss model shown in Listing 2-1 is small and the desired analysis is not a restart, the use of
the FMS is not needed.
Executive Control Section
The Executive Control Section  contains statements that
Select the solution sequence to be run (e.g., statics, normal modes).
Set the maximum MSC Nastran (not system) time permitted for the run.
Request various diagnostic outputs.
Contain user-written DMAP.  DMAP is an advanced topic and is beyond the scope of this user’s
guide.
For the truss example, the Executive Control Section specifies static solution SOL 101 and a TIME statement
that specifies a maximum of 2 CPU minutes for the run.  The end of the Executive Section is denoted by the
CEND  statement.  The ID statement is an optional statement to help document your input file.  If used, it
can be located anywhere in the Executive Control Section.
Case Control Section
Immediately following the CEND statement is the Case Control Section .  Case Control commands are used
to
Define subcases (e.g., loading and boundary conditions).
Make selections from the Bulk Data Section (e.g., loads, constraints, etc.).
Specify output requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Linear Statics Analysis User’s Guide
Overview of the MSC Nastran Input File36
Main Index
Define titles, subtitles and labels for documenting the analysis.
For the truss example, a title, subtitle, and label are defined.  These labels are printed on each page of the .f06
output file.  The LOAD = 10 command instructs MSC Nastran to apply the loading defined by the FORCE
entry with an ID of 10 in the Bulk Data Section.  The SPC = 11 command instructs MSC Nastran to apply
the constraints defined by the SPC1 entry with an ID of 11 in the Bulk Data Section.  Printed displacements
for all the grid points and the forces and stresses within each member are requested with the DISPLACEMENT
(Case)  = ALL, FORCE (Case)  = ALL, and STRESS  (Case)  = ALL commands.  By default, these output requests are
printed to the .f06 output file, which is discussed in Overview of the MSC Nastran Input File . The end of the Case
Control Section is denoted by the BEGIN BULK  delimiter.
Bulk Data Section
The Bulk Data Section is used to define the analysis via the grid points, elements, constraints, and loads.  The
start of the Bulk Data Section is denoted by the BEGIN BULK  delimiter.  The last entry in Bulk Data
Section must be an ENDDATA  delimiter.  The ENDDATA delimiter also signifies the end of the MSC
Nastran input file.  If any of these required delimiters are not present, a fatal error message results when the
job is submitted.
Most of the entries in the Bulk Data Section do not need to be selected by a Case Control command in order
to be included in the model.  In the truss example, the grid point and element entries are included in the
model no matter what the Case Control Section specifies.
However, to provide flexibility to the user, load and constraint entries are selected in the Case Control
Section.  This way, you can control which load and constraint entries specified in the Bulk Data Section are
actually used in a given analysis.  In other words, the load and constraint entries in the Bulk Data Section are
included in the analysis only if they are specified in the Case Control Section.  Having loads and constraint
entries in the Bulk Data Section that are not specified in the Case Control Section is allowed, but these entries
are not used in the analysis and hence do not affect the results.
The truss model consists of four grid points that represent the joints of the structure.  The locations of the
grid points for this example are given in what is known as the basic coordinate system, which is the default
coordinate system in MSC Nastran.  In this example, the origin is located at grid point 1.  You should note
that the dimensions given for the truss structure in Listing 2-1 are given in feet, but the dimensions used for
the grid point locations in the input file are entered in inches.  For consistency, the units for the cross-sectional
area, torsional stiffness, and Young’s modulus are also entered in inches.  It is the user’s responsibility to ensure
that the units for all of the input are consistent.&lt;br&gt;
Figure 2-2 summarizes the linking between the Case Control commands and the Bulk Data entries.&lt;/p&gt;

Figure 9-33  Antisymmetric Model
User Interface
No special user interaction is required in the Executive Control Section or Bulk Data Section.  Depending
on the number of planes of symmetry, approximately one-half or less of the structure needs to be modeled.&lt;br&gt;
For the above frame model, only one-half of the model needs to be analyzed.
This feature is activated by Case Control commands.  The above frame example is used to illustrate the
required Case Control commands.  Listing 9-1 contains the input file for this problem. (See

The first subcase selects out the symmetric boundary condition and load as shown in Figure 9-32(b).  The
second subcase selects out the antisymmetric  boundary condition and load as shown in Figure 9-33(b).
The third subcase is a “results combination” subcase.  No boundary or load conditions need to be applied for
this loading condition (see Modeling Guidelines , 331 ).  This subcase produces results for the portion of the
structure that you have modeled (the left-hand side of the frame in this case) by performing a linear
combination of the first two subcases.  This combination is achieved by adding 100% of the results for the
first subcase to 100% of the second subcase using the SUBSEQ  command.  Note that in this case of results
combination, the SUBCOM  instead of the SUBCASE  command is used.
The fourth subcase is also a “results combination” subcase.  It produces results for the portion of the structure
that you did not model (the right-hand side of the frame in this case).  These results are achieved by
substracting 100% of the results of the second subcase from 100% of the results from the first subcase.  As
in Subcase 3, the SUBCOM command instead of the SUBCASE command is used in this case.  Once again,
no load or boundary condition is needed for this subcase; this is an optional subcase.  It is not required if you
do not want to obtain results for the other half of the structure that you did not model.
The displacements for SUBCOM 3 and SUBCOM 4 are shown in Figure 9-34 along with the results obtained
from a full model run.  The results for SUBCOM 3 (left-hand side of the frame) correlate with the full model
results.  The results for SUBCOM 4 (right-hand side of the frame) correlate with the full model results except
for the sign changes for components x, , and .  The sign changes occur because the results of the right
half (reflected half) are produced in terms of its left half using the left-hand coordinate system.  Note that
these are the same degrees of freedom that are constrained for the symmetric boundary condition.yz

Figure 9-34  Results Comparison Using Symmetry Versus a Full Model
In the past, when computers were not as fast as they are now, the use of symmetry to reduce the finite element
model size was more popular than it is today.  The advantage of using symmetry is obviously the reduction
in model size.  The disadvantage is that it requires more effort on your part and it is more prone to errors
since you have to provide equivalent symmetric/antisymmetric boundaries and loading conditions to your
model.  In MSC Nastran, the use of symmetry is built into some of the solution sequences-they are known
as the cyclic symmetry  solution sequences ( Cyclic Symmetry ).  Similar approaches can be used with
superelement  analysis.
The SYM/SYMCOM Case Control command combination can be used instead of the
SUBCASE/SUBCOM combination.  If you use this combination, the only changes you have to make is to
replace the SUBCASE and SUBCOM Case Control commands with the SYM and SYMCOM Case Control
commands, respectively.  When the SUBCASE/SUBCOM combination is used, output is available in both
the SUBCASE and SUBCOM subcases.  On the other hand, when the SYM/SYMCOM combination is
used, output requests are only available in the SYMCOM subcases.  There is no real advantage to using the
SYM/SYMCOM command as compared to the SUBCASE/SUBCOM command.FULL MODEL - NEGATIVE Y LOAD                                                                            SUBCASE 1

Introduction to Model Verification
In Modeling Guidelines  (Ch. 9), details on various aspects of modeling were presented. This chapter is dedicated
to various tools that are available for verifying and improving the quality of your models.  They are broken
into five different categories:
Preprocessor checks .
Strain energy output .
Diagnostic tools .
Stress error estimators .
Postprocessor checks .
Some of these categories overlap each other.  Most of these checks provide you with a tremendous amount of
information, but yet their usages are quite straightforward and require very little effort on your part.
Preprocessor Checks
The use of computer graphics  in structural analysis is no longer a luxury&amp;ndash;it is an integral part of the standard
tools for all finite element users.  This section is intended to point out some of the handy tools that are
available in most commercial preprocessors .
Preprocessors are used extensively for the generation of finite element models.  They also contain features that
can help you to improve the quality of your model and detect errors in your model prior to analysis.  These
features can result in substantial savings in terms of time and money.
Some of the illustrations in this section may not be as dramatic as you would otherwise observe using the
actual graphic package.  A black and white picture in this user’s guide would certainly not appear as impressive
or useful as the actual color graphics that you can experience interactively in front of a graphics terminal.&lt;br&gt;
However, the illustration serves as a guide for features that you should keep in mind when using these
packages.  Depending on the graphics package that you use, some of these features may or may not be
available to you.
Shrink Plot
The shrink  option allows you to shrink your elements by a specified percentage.  This feature is an excellent
tool for identifying missing elements.  As an example, let us look at a plate model with 12 CQUAD4  elements
surrounded by 31 CBAR  elements as shown in Figure 10-1.  The normal unshrunk plot looks something like
Figure 10-1(a).  The CBAR elements are not visible since they lie on top of the edges of the CQUAD4
elements.
Now replot this figure using the shrink option.  By using the shrink option as shown in Figure 10-1(b), it
becomes quite obvious that you are missing a CBAR element at the top and a CQUAD4 element close to the
center.  Had you not used the shrink option, these missing elements would probably have gone undetected.&lt;br&gt;
You may argue that had the element labels been turned on, the missing elements would probably have been
noticed.  This is certainly a valid argument in this case since the model is a simple one.  However, for complex&lt;/p&gt;

models, the picture would have become too crowded to be useful had all the labels been turned on.  This
same shrink feature can also be applied to solid elements  in a similar manner.

Hidden Line/Shaded Plots
For a complicated model, looking at a wireframe  model by itself can be quite confusing since you lose the
depth of field.  However, hidden line  and shaded plots  can serve as the perfect complement to the wireframe
plots.  The box model in Figure 10-2 is a perfect example.  This model is made of CHEXA  elements and has
a hole in the front.  By looking at the wireframe plot on the top left-hand corner of Figure 10-2, you may not
notice that there is a hole in the front.  However, the hidden line (top right), shaded (bottom left), and shaded
with shrink  option (bottom right) plots all reveal the hole in front of the box.  Furthermore, when using these
features, you can see the structure being plotted from back to front, which gives you a better perspective of
what the structure looks like.  As the structure becomes more complicated, you will appreciate these features
even more.(a) (b)&lt;/p&gt;

Free Edge/Face
A free  edge  is an edge that is connected by one single two-dimensional element (e.g., CQUAD4). The
existence of free edges does not necessarily indicate a modeling problem.  Figure 10-3 represents a crude wing
model.  The bold lines around the outside are examples of legitimate free edges.  On the other hand, whether
the internal vertical bold line is a legitimate free edge or not depends on your design intent.  This free edge
indicates that elements 12 and 14, 11, and 13 are not connected to each other.  If this is not your intention,
then this free edge indicates a potential modeling error.
This can happen, for example, if you create this wing with four separate surfaces as shown in Figure 10-4.  Most
preprocessors  typically create geometric surfaces and then generate the finite element mesh for each of these
surfaces.  Since elements 12 and 14 are created from two separate geometric surfaces, their connecting grid
points have distinct IDs.  After these elements are generated, if you want them to share the same edge, then
you must perform some sort of equivalencing operation.  The exact operation depends on the graphics
package itself.  This free edge indicates that you have either forgotten to perform this equivalencing operation
or the equivalencing tolerance level is not tight enough for the program to perform this task.&lt;/p&gt;

Figure 10-3  Wing Free Edge Check
Figure 10-4  Wing Geometric Surfaces
The free face  concept is similar to the free edge concept except that it applies to three-dimensional elements
instead of two-dimensional elements.  A free face is a face that is occupied by one single three-dimensional
element (e.g., CHEXA ).  The example in Figure 10-5 contains two volumes.  After these two volumes are
meshed with solid elements (e.g., CHEXAs), a free face check is performed.  The outside surfaces of these
two volumes indicate that they are free faces that are legitimate.  In addition, it indicates that the adjoining
surface (hashed area) is also a free surface.  This indicates that the two volumes are not connected, which may
or may not be your intention.  If it is not your intention, there is probably a modeling error.1516

Zipper Effect
When adjoining surfaces are connected at very few points, the interface has a tendency to open up when it is
loaded.  This looks similar to a zipper and hence is classified as the “zipper effect.”  Use the surfaces in
Figure 10-4 and create new meshes.  Surfaces 1, 2, 3, and 4 contain meshes of ,
respectively.  As you can see in Figure 10-6 the interface between surfaces 2 and 3 is only connected at two grid
points&amp;ndash;grid points A and B.  The loads can only be transferred between these two portions of the structure
through these two locations.  In other words, the load path may be quite different from what the actual
structure does.12

Main Index
Figure 10-6  Model with Zipper Effect
The “zipper effect” can occur in both plate and solid element models.  Therefore, when generating meshes
for a structure with multiple surfaces and/or volumes, you should keep this in mind so that the interfaces are
connected properly.  You should always perform a quick check by zooming in at all the interface locations.
CBAR/CBEAM Orientation and Offset Check
One common error that many users make is the incorrect orientation of the CBAR/CBEAM inertia
properties .  Definitions of the CBAR/CBEAM orientation vectors are provided in MSC Nastran Elements . If the
graphics package that you are using plots these orientation vectors , you should take advantage of this feature
to ensure that you have oriented these elements properly.  You should also check the CBAR/CBEAM  element
offset plots, if they are available.
Duplicate Grid Points/Elements
The “duplicate grid point check” feature highlights grid points that occupy the same location.  Having grid
points occupy the same space may or may not be your intention.  An example of unintentional grid points
occupying the same location can be a result of not performing an equivalencing operation after meshing more
than one curve, surface, or volume.  An application of intentional duplicate grid points can be a model used
to simulate a bolted joint.  This effect can be achieved by connecting a stiff spring between these two points
that occupy the same location but are connected to different portions of the structure.
The “duplicate element check” feature is similar to the “duplicate grid check” except the check is done on the
elements rather than the grid points.  These errors are often due to unintentionally meshing the same line,
surface, or volume more than once.
Properties/Material Plots
You can also assign different colors to elements based on their property IDs (e.g., PSHELL IDs).  If you have
assigned an incorrect property, graphically this becomes quite obvious.  Differentiating by color can also be
used to highlight material properties (e.g., MATi IDs).BA&lt;/p&gt;

Consistent Plate Normals
When you create a model, you should always generate the elements in a consistent manner.  In some cases,
it makes your bookkeeping job a bit easier.  However, in other cases, if you do not generate your model in a
consistent manner, you can then inadvertently apply the loads in the wrong directions.  An example of such
a case is when the applied load is a pressure load .  The plate model, consisting of four CQUAD4s as shown
in Figure 10-7, is used to illustrate this point.  As mentioned in MSC Nastran Elements , each CQUAD4  has a
positive normal direction associated with it.  This direction is defined by the way you connect the grids of the
element using the right-hand rule.  The symbols used to denote the directions of the normals  are shown in
Figure 10-8.
Figure 10-7  CQUAD4 Model
Now apply a 100 psi pressure load to these four elements.  The direction of the pressure load is pointing into
the paper. Listing 10-1 contains the relevant partial input file for this job.  In this case, the grid points for each
element are defined in a consistent  manner.  They are connected in a clockwise direction.  Therefore, the
positive normals are all pointing into the paper as indicated by Figure 10-8(a).37 8

On the other hand, perhaps for some reason, you connect element 3 in a counterclockwise direction
(Figure 10-8(b)) instead of a clockwise direction like the other three elements.  If this is the case, you then need
to change the sign of the pressure load for element number 3 in order to have identical loads for both cases
(see Listing 10-2).  Determining the positive direction of the pressure load  for the CQUAD4  element can be
achieved by checking the connectivity order using the right-hand rule.  If the sign for the pressure load Listing 10-1  Consistent CQUAD4 Connectivity

applied to element number 3 is not switched, then you have three elements with the pressure load pointing
into the paper and the fourth element with the pressure load pointing out of the paper.
This type of inconsistency can occur if the whole model is generated with a preprocessor using multiple
surfaces and the consistency of the connectivity direction is not retained.  This problem is also likely to occur
if you edit some of the elements manually and forget to account for the sign change in the pressure load.&lt;br&gt;
Many graphics packages offer this element normal check feature.  This type of check requires very little effort,
and in many cases the graphics processor may also allow you to reverse the direction of the normals.
The CQUAD4 element outputs are in the element coordinate system.  Different connectivity orders affect
the way the results are printed.  If you are not aware of this fact, you may interpret the results improperly (see
the example in Stress Error Estimators ).
Strain Energy Output
Frequently you are faced with the decision of modifying your structure in order to meet stringent design
criteria.  In most instances, your objective is to maximize the benefits with minimal changes.  The element
strain energy output is an excellent tool for identifying areas of modification that will reap the most benefits
for design changes.
The element strain energy  is basically the elastic energy stored in the structural element.  As an example, if
you hold onto one end of the spring  and push slowly on the other end starting from rest, the load deflection
curve looks something like Figure 10-9 for small deflections.Listing 10-2  Inconsistent CQUAD4 Connectivity

By working through a couple of examples, you can see how the element strain energy output is used to
identify areas to be modified in order to reduce deflections.
The problem of interest is shown in Figure 10-10.  It consists of two springs  in a series with a tip load applied
at grid point 2.  The stiffnesses of the springs and the load applied are as shown in Figure 10-10.  The goal is
to reduce the tip deflection at grid point 2.  Without performing any calculation, it is quite obvious that
stiffening  is more efficient than stiffening .  The next step is to calculate the strain energy and see if
it also guides you in the same direction.

From Equation (10-1) and Equation (10-2),
As you can see, U2 is an order of magnitude larger than U1.  Therefore, it concurs with our intuition that
stiffening K2 is more effective than stiffening K1 for reducing the deflection at the tip.
The second example is a classic cantilever beam with a vertical tip load applied at the end as shown in
Figure 10-11.  This finite element model is made up of five bar elements of equal length with square cross-
sectional properties (0.05m x 0.05m) as shown in Table 10-1.

Figure 10-11  Cantilever Beam
When this sample problem is run, the largest deflection occurs at the tip of the cantilever beam.  (See
MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/secant.dat) The vertical deflection at grid point 6 is equal to
meters.  The goal is to minimize this deflection at grid point 6.  To make the problem
more interesting, hypothetically impose the following constraint such that all that is available is one structural
member that is  and 1m long.  In other words, you can only replace one of the existing five
CBAR elements with this new CBAR element.  Which one should you replace to minimize the deflection at
grid point 6?  Since grid point 6 has the largest deflection, combined with our experience with the spring
problem, you may be tempted to replace CBAR element number 5 with this new element. (See
MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/secant5.dat) If you do this, the vertical displacement at grid point 6 is then
reduced from  meters down to  meters, a reduction of only 0.414%.&lt;br&gt;
Now review what the element strain energy output suggests. The ESE (Case)  Case Control command provides
the output summarized in Figure 10-12:
Multiple sets of output requests can be selected by using the Case Control command SETP (Case)  in the MSC
Nastran Quick Reference Guide . If an ESE command references a SETP identification number the all the SETs
listed on the SETP entry are processed individually.
For large models, the element strain energy request can potentially generate a large amount of printout.  If
this is not desired, use the ESE (PLOT) = ALL Case Control command option to create a postprocessing file
containing element strain energy data without generating printed output.
As it turns out, element number 1 has the highest element strain energy among the five elements.  In fact, it
contains 48.8% of the total strain energy of the whole structure.  On the other hand, element number 5
contains the lowest element strain energy among the five elements&amp;ndash;only 0.8%.  In other words, element
number 5 is the least effective element to modify if you wish to increase the stiffness of the structure for the
same amount of weight increase.1 N

Now rerun by replacing element number 1 with the new  element.  (See
MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/SECANT1.dat) The deflection at grid point 6 is now reduced from
meters down to  meters, or a reduction of 25.27% as compared to a
mere 0.414% reduction if you had replaced element number 5 instead.
Figure 10-12  Element Strain Energy Output for a Cantilever Beam Model
As you can see, the element strain energy  output is an extremely useful tool in helping you to identify the
most efficient locations for modification.  The same concept used for the previous two simple examples can
be applied to complex models in the same manner.
When loads from temperature differences or element deformation are present, the default definition of
element strain energy for linear elements differs from the definition for nonlinear elements. In linear elements
the element load vector for temperature loads and element deformation, assumes that the temperatures are
constant within a subcase. For nonlinear elements, it is assumed that the temperature varies linearly within a
subcase. The user may request the definition for nonlinear elements be applied to linear elements by adding
PARAM, XFLAG ,2 to the input file.
Diagnostic Tools
There are numerous diagnostic tools  available in MSC Nastran for debugging  and understanding the solution
process.  Some of them are standard output; others are available with requests in the Executive Control
Section , Case Control Section , and/or Bulk Data Section .
Element Summary Output (ELSUM)
The ELSUM (Case)  Case Control command controls the generation of a printed table of informational
properties for the various element types present in the input data file. The information produced includes
element measures ( length, thickness, area, and volume) and mass property data (structural, non-structural,
total, and weight [weightmass*total mass]). The information is grouped according to the finite element type
by element type/ID or by property type/ID. Both groupings may be selected at the same time. The output
produced can be full or subtotals. The SUMMARY only option limits the output to only the mass property 0.0606

sub-totals. No individual element property output is generated. This reduces the amount of information, if
only the totals for an element type are of interest.
With the grouping by element property type, mass property output can be summarized for all of the elements
that reference property ids within each property type.
For each element present in the model, physical metrics appropriate to the element type are computed. These
metrics may include length, thickness, area, and volume. Mass properties are computed for supported
element types. For the CONM1 element, the mass is taken to be the average of the M11, M22 and M33
values on the CONM1 Bulk Data entry. In addition, references to material properties and element properties
are gathered for each element. For bar, beam and shell elements, an attempt is made to determine whether
the property reference is to a basic property entry, or has been derived from one of the available alternate
input entries (PBARL, PBEAML, PBCOMP , PCOMP , PCOMPG). If it is determined that the property is
derived, a character (L for PBARL or PBEAML, P for PBCOMP , PCOMP or PCOMPG) is appended to
the property identification number on output. For the case of the element type grouping, each element type
is summarized in turn. For each element type, information for each element is displayed. Sub-totals are
generated for mass property information. For the case of the property type grouping, each property type
referenced by an element type is summarized in turn. All of the property ids referenced within the type are
summarized in ascending property id order. Within this summary, information for each element referencing
the property id is displayed. Various subtotals are accumulated and displayed.
Only the following element types produce mass property information: CBAR, CBEAM, CBEND, CHEXA,
CMASSi, CONM1, CONM2, CONROD, CPENTA, CQUAD4, CQUAD8, CQUADR, CRAC2D,
CRAC3D, CROD, CSHEAR, CTETRA, CTRIA3, CTRIA6, CTRIAR, CTRIAX6, and CTUBE
The complete description of the Case Control command ELSUM is located in ELSUM (Case)  in the MSC
Nastran Quick Reference Guide . The EID and PID keywords are used to select the particular grouping desired
for the element summary output. The EID keyword requests grouping by element type while the PID
keyword requests grouping by element property type. The BOTH keyword requests both groupings. The
PIDSUM keyword requests that only mass property totals be output for the PID grouping. The EIDSUM
keyword requests that only mass property totals be output for the EID grouping.
In the following ELSUM Case Control command output Figure 10-13 is an example of the EID grouping
output and Figure 10-14 is an example of the PID grouping output. If PIDSUM or EIDSUM were used, then
only the subtotals and totals information would be present in the figures.&lt;/p&gt;

Element Geometry Checks (GEOMCHECK)
Overview
Mathematical models are usually composed of several different types of finite elements depending upon the
simulation being performed and the type of structure being investigated.  For each of these finite element
formulations, thorough evaluations of the geometry presented are performed prior to and during element
matrix generation operations.  These geometry tests are typically used to determine whether (1) the element
geometry is adequate for finite element matrix generation at all, and if so, (2) how close the geometry could  E L E M E N T   P R O P E R T Y   S U M M A R Y     (BY PROPERTY TYPE / ID)

be to producing poor formulations.  T aking a beam element for example, a fatal geometry condition would
be locations of the two end points that result in an element with zero length.  An example of the second type
of geometry check for a beam would be an excessive ratio of the length of the beam with offset vectors to the
length of the beam without them.  In the first case, the geometry check is fatal because the finite element
cannot be formulated from the given geometry and the simulation cannot be done.  In the second case, the
geometry check is informational and the simulation analysis can proceed.  It is the user’s responsibility to
inspect these informational messages and determine if the results are acceptable.
Several different basic geometry tests are performed; for example, duplicate grid point location tests, mid-side
node location tests, warped element tests, and aspect ratio tests. One or more of these types of tests is
performed using the geometry supplied for each finite element. Obviously, not all tests apply to every element
type. Each one of the geometry tests is accompanied by a message that can generate up to four lines of
informational output for an element if the test tolerance is violated. For models that employ a small number
of elements, this amount of output is not overwhelming. However, the size and complexity of mathematical
simulation models have continued to grow over time. It is no longer surprising to see models that generate
hundreds of thousands of lines of output from these tests alone. In an effort to reduce the amount of output
generated by geometry checks, a style of output for reporting the results of the element geometry tests has
been introduced. The results for all tests for a single element are reported on a single line together with a visual
indication of which tests have exceeded their tolerances and the severity of the failure. Default values for all
test tolerances are defined such that geometry tests result in the same type of pass/fail decision as previous
releases. In a few cases, additional tests are performed. At the same time, the GEOMCHECK executive
statement has been introduced to give users more control over the test tolerances, their severity levels and the
number of messages output.
GEOMCHECK Statement
The GEOMCHECK statement provides users with a way to override the default values supplied for all tests.
Except for a very few isolated instances, bad geometry that does not allow the formulation of finite element
matrix data is always fatal and is not under user control. In these cases, the informational message formats
have not been modified. Every test that fails will produce a message for every element. For the cases where
geometry does not prevent finite element matrix generation, additional tests that evaluate various geometry
parameters are performed and the results reported to the user. For these tests, the user can control both the
test tolerance and the severity level of test failure. Using the BAR element as an example, there is a test
performed that evaluates the ratio of the BAR’s length with offset effects to the length without offset effects.&lt;br&gt;
The tolerance for this test is 15%, meaning that if the length with offset is different from the length without
the offset by more than fifteen percent, an informational message is issued and element processing continues.&lt;br&gt;
The user can change the tolerance if desired. The severity of the test failure can also be changed from
informational to fatal if desired. In that case, any BAR element that exceeds the offset ratio test tolerance will
cause the job to stop after element matrix generation has been attempted for all elements.
The GEOMCHECK statement can only be used to modify geometry test activities for the QUAD4,
QUADR, TRIA3, TRIAR, BAR, BEAM, HEXA, PENTA, PYRAM  and TETRA finite elements at this time.
As stated previously, only informational tests can be affected using the GEOMCHECK statement. Results of
geometry generated by MSC Nastran that prevent the generation of a finite element matrix cannot be
modified using the GEOMCHECK statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;405 CHAPTER 10

Keywords are available that allow control over the number of messages to be generated ( MSGLIMIT) as well
as the severity of the message ( MSGTYPE) and its associated effect on the job.  Only a severity of FATAL
will cause the job to abort after the element matrix generation module has executed.
Several different types of geometry tests are performed.  For each finite element type, the geometry must be
tested to ensure that it is adequate to allow generation of element matrices.  No attempt is made here to
describe those tests.  Rather, tests that optionally evaluate certain characteristics of the geometry are
described. These tests fall into several categories depending upon the element type.  Thus, not all tests are
applicable to every element type.  The discussion that follows summarizes the optional geometry tests that
are applicable to various element types.
The geometry check is requested by the Executive Control Statement GEOMCHECK  in the MSC Nastran Quick
Reference Guide  and the format is as follows:

produced. Also note that a small table is generated at the end of all messages that summarizes the number of
tests that actually exceeded the tolerance value for each element type as well as a list of the elements that
produced the worst violations. The summary table itself can be produced by using the keyword SUMMARY

2.Taper test: The QUAD4 taper ratio test compares the area of the triangles formed at the four corner
nodes (the corner node and the two nodes attached to it via the two element edges) to the total area
of the QUAD4. The maximum of the four values is taken as the taper ratio.  If the ratio exceeds the
tolerance, an informational message is produced.

3.Skew test: This test evaluates the distortion or “parallelogram shape effect” by measuring the angle
between lines that join the midpoints of opposite sides of the element.  If the angle exceeds the
tolerance, an informational message is produced.

4.Warp test: This test evaluates how far out of plane the four corner grid points are by measuring the
distance of each point from a “mean” plane passing through the locations of the four points. The
corner points are alternately H units above and H units below this mean plane. If the lengths of the
diagonals of the element are denoted by D1 and D2, the warping coefficient is obtained from the
equation WC = H / 2(D1+D2).  If this value exceeds the tolerance, an informational message is
produced.
CTRIA3 and CTRIAR
T wo optional tests are performed on the triangular shaped planar elements. They are the Interior Angle test
and Skew test as discussed previously under the CQUAD4 and CQUADR test description.
CHEXA, CPENTA, CPYRAM  and CTETRA
Five optional tests are performed on the solid element family. Not all tests are applicable to every element
type. These tests are:
1.Aspect Ratio test: This test evaluates the ratio of the longest length (edge or height) to the shortest
length (edge or height) encountered in the element. If the ratio exceeds the tolerance, an
informational message is produced.
2.Edge Point Length Ratio and Edge Point Included Angle test: This test evaluates the location of the
“mid-side” nodes if any are present. The node should be located on the line connecting the two
adjacent corner grid points at approximately the mid-way point. This determination is made in two
ways. First, the distance of the node from the two corner nodes is measured and if the ratio of the
distance from one node to the other exceeds the tolerance, an informational message is issued. Next,
the angles between the lines connecting the mid-side node to its two adjacent corner nodes, and the
line connecting the corner nodes themselves, is evaluated. If either of the angles exceeds the tolerance
(default 150.0 degrees), an informational message is issued.
3.Integration Point Jacobian Determinant test: This test evaluates the determinant of the Jacobian at
each integration point. If it is zero, or changes sign from integration point to integration point, an
informational message is issued. Note that detection of a zero value should always be fatal because
element matrices calculated from such geometry rarely produce satisfactory analysis results.
4.Warped Face test: This test is applicable to CHEXA, CPYRAM  and CPENTA elements. It evaluates
the warping coefficient of the quadrilateral faces of such elements in a manner similar to that discussed
previously under the CQUAD4 element warping test description. If the warping coefficient exceeds
the tolerance, an informational message is issued.&lt;/p&gt;

5.Grid Point Jacobian Determinant test: This test is applicable to CTETRA elements only.  The test
is the same as that done for the integration point test discussed previously except it uses the location
of the corner grid points to perform the test.  If any determinant is zero or changes sign, an
informational message is produced.
Model Checking Material Properties  (MODEL_CHECK)
The main purpose of this feature is to provide the users with a means to evaluate the mass and thermal load
characteristics of a structure. This feature is intended primarily for linear static analysis runs that are being
used to validate aspects of the finite element model prior to embarking on more expensive production static
and dynamics analyses. It allows the user to temporarily modify the material density and thermal expansion
coefficient fields of material property bulk data entries. The MODEL_CHECK Executive Control statement
and several NASTRAN Statement keywords (DEF_i’s) are used. The affected material property fields will be
temporarily modified during the run.  All results will be based on the temporary values of the material
properties.  The material property data stored on the Material Property Table data block is not modified and
retains the original values supplied on the bulk data entries.
Editing large models can be slow, tedious and error prone. This can be replaced with MODEL_CHECK. If
MODEL_CHECK is selected the appropriate entry of the material property data (mass density and/or
thermal expansion coefficient(s)) is set to the user-specified value.  All subsequent computations use the
updated values.  There is no need to edit Bulk Data input with multiple sets of material or thermal property
entries.
This feature is activated using the MODEL_CHECK  Executive Control statement.  The MODEL_CHECK
statement features keywords that allow a value to be temporarily assigned to the material density and thermal
expansion coefficients.  The general format of the statement used to change material properties to a specified
value is:
MODEL_CHECK   [ MAT_DENSITY=value, ]     [ MAT_TECO=value, ]   [ MAT_TEIJ=value ]a
bcd&lt;/p&gt;

Main Index
This feature is similiar to PARAM,CHECKOUT,YES, but does not require modifing the Bulk Data section
of the input data.
MODEL_CHECK is ignored in RESTARTs
Material property updates will take effect for all MAT1, MAT2, MAT3, MAT8 and MAT9 Bulk
Data entries present in the input .
Material properties stored on the Material Property Table (MPT) data block are those present on the
bulk data material property entries.
Post-processing of results could reference in-consistent data since the results are based upon different
material property data than is present in the bulk data .
Part of a sample problem (see MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/varmat10a.dat) is presented to demonstrate the
material property update feature.  The example consists of several disjoint models and is not intended to be
representative of any production model.  The MODEL_CHECK statement is used to temporarily set all
material densities and thermal expansion coefficients to 0.0.  This results in model mass contributions from
only the CONM2 element and the non-structural mass as well as results for the temperature load case
(subcase 3) being null.

$TEST DECK NAME: varmat01a.dat  (Baseline Model w/MODEL_CHECK)
$                Density is not temperature dependent.
$                Thermal expansion coefficient is not temp. dependent
$                MODEL_CHECK command present.
$
$PURPOSE:
$   Demonstrate usage of the MODEL_CHECK Executive Control Statement
$   Note that non-structural mass cannot be modified using this command.
$
$DESCRIPTION:
$  The model consists of
$  1) CONM2 eid 3001 contributing mass.
$  2) ROD   eid  101 referencing MAT1 materials
$  3) QUAD4 eid 3301 w/ PSHELL referencing MAT1 materials
$  4) QUAD4 eid 3313 w/ PSHELL referencing MAT1 and MAT2 materials
$  5) QUAD4 eid 3321 w/ PCOMP  referencing MAT8 materials
$  6) HEXA  eid 6701 w/ PSOLID referencing MAT9 materials
$  7) TRIAX6 id 5301           referencing MAT3 materials
$
$  A MODEL_CHECK executive command is used to modify material property
$  data temporarily during the run.  The command demonstrates
$  1) setting the material density to 0.0 via the OFF option
$  2) setting the material thermal expansion coefficients to 0.0 via
$     the OFF option
$  3) continuation of MODEL_CHECK command
$
$EXPECTED RESULTS:
$  1) There should be an informational message indicating which of the
$     material property data is being modified.
$  2) The grid point weight generator and element summary outputs should
$     indicate mass for only the conm2 element and the non-structural&lt;/p&gt;

The printed output for the example problem consists of all of the output typically generated by a static
analysis for the requests present in the case control section of the input and is not reproduced here.  There is
a small section of additional printed output generated in the Executive Control Echo region when the
MODEL_CHECK material property options are used.  The output summarizes the requested material
property updates and is shown on the next several lines.&lt;/p&gt;

There is no other printed output generated that is peculiar to the material property update feature.  All other
output is typical printed output that is generated by the case control requests.  For this example, the Grid
Point Weight Generator output was requested via param,grdpnt,0 in the bulk data so that the mass of the
structure could be verified as being produced by only the CONM2 element and the element non-structural
mass.
Weight Checks (PARAM,GRDPNT,WEIGHTCHECK)
Is the weight of my model correct?  This question can be answered by activating the Grid Point Weight
Generator (GPWG).  The GPWG is activated with the parameter GRDPNT  in the Bulk Data or Case Control
Section s. See Grid Point Weight Generator  for a detailed explanation.
The data entry format is
PARAM,GRDPNT,i
where “i” is an integer value defining a reference point.  The value of “i” can be any grid point in the model,
or if it is set to zero, the reference point is the origin of the basic coordinate system.
The WEIGHTCHECK (Case) =YES Case Control command will also activate the GPWG output, but only the “G”
set can be selected in statics.
The output from the GPWG  includes a rigid body mass matrix, various coordinate transformations, and the
location of the center of mass.  The output from the GPWG is generally more than what you need.  The mass
and center of gravity (CG) location is typically all that is used.  A partial output for the problem is shown in
Figure 10-18. (See MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/diag.dat)

then your properties, such as areas (A), should be in terms of m2.  MSC Nastran expects your mass input  $

(MATi , CONMi , etc.) to be in terms of mass units.  However, if you would rather input your mass in terms
of weight units, then you must add the following entry to your Bulk Data Section:
PARAM,WTMASS ,x
In the parameter statement above, x is the appropriate conversion factor based on the units that you are using
with a default value of 1.0.  In other words, the weight density is related to the mass density by the
relationship&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where:
In the example below, the mass came from the density entered on the MAT1 entry associated with the CBAR&lt;br&gt;
elements.  In this case, the density is in terms of mass units.  Since the grid point locations are defined in
terms of meters, the density  should then be in units of kg/ m3.  Using a consistent set of units, the Young’s
modulus ( E)and density  ( ) are 7.1E10 N/ m2 and 2700 kg/ m3 as indicated by Fields 3 and 6, respectively,
on the following MAT1 entry.
On the other hand, if you want to input your density in weight units, then you should replace the above
MAT1  entry with the following two entries.
This density and all the other masses (excluding M2PP or M2GG  input) are multiplied by this scale factor.&lt;br&gt;
In this case, (0.1019 × 2.65E4 = 2700) .  The results (e.g., displacements, stresses, etc.) are the same using
either of the above mass or weight units.
The only difference is in the grid point weight generator output.  The GPWG  output is in the same units of
your density or point masses.  In other words, if your input is in mass units, then the GPWG output is also
in mass units.  If your input is in weight units, then the GPWG output is also in weight units.w=weight density

If you are using English units, then the following two sets of entries yield the same results.  Of course, other
units in your model must also be consistent, e.g., the grid point locations and cross-sectional properties.
The output from GPWG is for informational purposes only and is not used in any subsequent steps in the
solution process.  An extensive discussion of the grid point weight generator output is contained in Four
Concentrated Mass Model  (App. 19).
Mechanisms and Singularities
When performing the solution to a system of linear equations, singularities lead to conditions in which a
unique solution is not possible.  MSC Nastran considers two types of singularities:
1.Grid point singularity that is identified by considering the stiffness terms of only one grid point.
2.A mechanism  type of singularity  that requires the consideration of the stiffness terms of more than
one grid point.
Singularities cause ill-conditioned matrices that can be detected in several phases of the MSC Nastran
execution.
After matrix assembly, the grid point singularities are detected.  At each grid point, a  partition of the
stiffness  matrix for each of the three translational and three rotational DOFs is solved as an eigenvalue
problem to determine the principal stiffnesses.  Each stiffness term is compared to the principal stiffness  using
the formula
where   is the term in the i-th row and i-th column of the matrix and  is the principal stiffness.  If
is less than the value of PARAM,EPZERO, the global direction nearest i is considered singular.  The
default value for EPZERO is .  A list of potential singularities is printed in the grid point singularity
table (see Strain Energy Output  in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide  for further details).$   MASS DENSITY (lb-sec2/in4)

If PARAM,AUTOSPC ,YES is specified (this is the default in the Structured Solution Sequences, except
SOLs 106 and 129), the potential singularities are automatically constrained if possible. The case control
command AUTOSPC replaces PARAM,EPZERO and PARAM,AUTOSPC.
During decomposition, mechanisms can be detected based on the maximum ratio of the matrix diagonal to
the factor diagonal

factor diagonal matrix.  For a symmetric matrix K it can be represented as

If the MAXRATIO value is exceeded, your job terminates with DMAP Fatal Message 9050.  You can override
this fatal message by inserting “PARAM,BAILOUT ,-1&amp;quot; in your input file.  You should, however, be aware
that a large value of the MATRIX/FACTOR DIAGONAL may be an indication of a potential modeling
problem.  Taking the log10 of MAXRATIO indicates how many significant digits may have been lost during
the decomposition.  The MAXRATIO may change slightly if a different sequencer  is used.  This change is
due to the fact that the order of operation may change with a different sequencer that yields a different
numerical roundoff.
After decomposition, a singularity may lead to an incorrect solution.  In static analysis, MSC Nastran solves
to obtain u (displacements).  Using these displacements, MSC Nastran then calculates a “residual” loading
vector as follows:
This residual vector should theoretically be null but may not be null due to numeric roundoff.  To obtain a
normalized value of the residual loading, an error measure is calculated by
can be printed by including PARAM,IRES,1 in your Bulk Data Section.  The value  (epsilon) is
printed in User Information Message (UIM) 5293 as shown below.  Epsilon values that are greater than 0.001
are flagged for a possible loss of accuracy due to numeric conditioning as shown below:
One is generated for each loading condition.  An acceptable value of depends on the model complexity
and the machine that it runs on.  An epsilon value of in the neighborhood of less than 10-9 is generally
considered acceptable.  More details on this subject are available in References 4. and 5., and Constraints  of this
user’s guide.
Some general causes for singularity can include:
Degrees of freedom without stiffness because of missing elements.
A 2-D plate problem with the normal  rotation unconstrained.
A solid model with rotational DOFs at the corners unconstrained.
Incorrect modeling of offset beams .

Solver MAXRATIO Information Output
The SPARSESOLVER Executive Control statement provides the analyst better control of the generation of
matrix diagonal term ratio statistics produced by the sparse symmetric matrix decomposition process in the
DCMP module, then the MAXRATIO DMAP parameter. In addition, a output data option is available in
the form of a simple bar chart that provides a comprehensive view of the ratio data.
The method involves the computation of a ratio defined as the original matrix diagonal term divided by the
decomposed matrix diagonal term. These ratios are placed in a table together with the external identifier
associated with the row/column of the term. This table is then processed according to the options requested
by the user.  The matrix diagonal term ratio output options are controlled by keywords specified on the
SPARSESOLVER Executive Control statement. See SPARSESOLVER  in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference
Guide  for a complete description of this statement.
The matrix diagonal term ratios can be presented in two different views. The first view is the table view, in
which each ratio is listed together with the external identifier of the row/column of the matrix, as well as the
original input matrix diagonal term.
The second view of the ratios is statistical in nature. It is similar to a bar chart. A series of bar segments are
generated. There are two options for specifying the segment widths of the bars. The default option uses
powers of 10 as the widths (e.g., 10.0 to 100.0, and 100.0 to 1000.0). The second option allows the user to
specify how many segments are desired. The program will compute the segment width using the maximum
and minimum ratios. For each bar in the chart, the total number of terms in the range is tabulated together
with a visual indication of the percentage number of terms in that particular bar.
Note that when negative matrix diagonal term ratios are detected, they will always be output if the TABLE
option is specified.
These views of the ratios do not replace any existing diagnostics generated by the DCMP module if a problem
is detected. Under these conditions, output from the table view may duplicate previous output generated by
DCMP module error processing.
The defaults produce both table and bar outputs. The table is limited to 25 ratios that exceed 1.0E+05. The
bar chart uses powers of ten for segment widths. The basic use is by adding
SPARSESOLVER DCMP (MDTRATIO)
in the Executive Control Section of the input data file.
The use of this feature is limited to sparse symmetric matrix operations in the DCMP module.
If there are scalar-type points present in the problem, the degrees of freedom associated with these points will
be grouped into the results for the translational degrees of freedom output.&lt;/p&gt;

Main Index
A simple example is presented that demonstrates the use of some of the features available for output of the
matrix diagonal term ratios. The SPARSESOLVER Executive Control statement is used to specify the desired
features. The example is for demonstration purposes only, and is not representative any particular modeling
situation. The model data consists of a simple plate structure subject to an end load.
The output generated by the example is shown as follows. Notice that there are two separate sections of
output: one for translational degrees of freedom, and one for rotational degrees of freedom. Within each
section, both a bar chart and table of matrix diagonal term ratios are output.
Applied Loads Check
Are the loads being applied to the structure correctly?  There are two checks available in MSC Nastran for
this purpose. The first one is the summation of the total loads applied to the structure about the reference
point x as specified on the PARAM,GRDPNT ,x entry.  If PARAM,GRDPNT,x is not specified, this
summation is performed about the origin of the basic coordinate system.  This quantity is known as the
OLOAD RESULTANT output and is part of the standard MSC Nastran output.  It consists of seven lines
of output per load case.  The OLOAD  RESULTANT output for the problem is shown in Figure 10-19. (See
MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/diag.dat) Note that loads from scalar points are not included in the OLOAD&lt;/p&gt;

Figure 10-19  OLOAD Resultant
Look at Subcase 1 with a vertical tip load applied to grid point 6 in the +z direction.  Since there are no loads
applied to the structure in the x- or y-direction, the loads in those two directions are also equal to zero.  The
total z-load is equal to 100 Newtons contributed solely by the applied load at grid point 6, which is the only
applied load for the whole structure.  The total moment about the origin of the basic coordinate system is&lt;br&gt;
-5 × (100 N) = -500 Nm  about the y-axis.  This R2 moment is contributed by the Z load as indicated by the
-500 in row FZ, column R2. There is no moment about the other two axes.  The next seven lines in the
OLOAD RESULTANT output is due to the gravity load, the seconding loading condition.
So far, only the resultant applied load was discussed.  You can also request more detailed information
regarding the exact location on the structure where loads are applied.  This can be done with the OLOAD (Case)&lt;br&gt;
request in the Case Control Section .  The format is as follows:
OLOAD = All
or
SET 10 = x,y,z
OLOAD = 10
In this particular case, a printout of all the applied loads is requested.  As shown in Figure 10-20, there is one
load applied to grid point 6 in the +z direction for Subcase 1.  However, for the gravity load in Subcase 2,
each grid point that has mass associated with it has a 1g load applied to it.  Each CBAR  element contributes
{(2700)(1.0)(2.5E-3)(9.8)/2} = 33.075 N to each end of its connecting grid points.  Therefore, a 33.075 N
load is applied to the end points and a 66.15 N load is applied to each of the intermediate points since there
are two CBAR elements connected to each of these intermediate grid points.  As you can see, for a large
model, OLOAD output for gravity loads  can potentially generate many lines of output.0                      OLOAD    RESULTANT    &lt;br&gt;

Figure 10-20  OLOAD Output
Reaction Load
Are the reaction loads  correct?  This is a fundamental equilibrium check.  Again, there are two checks available
in MSC Nastran for this purpose.  The first one is the summation of the total reaction loads about the
reference point specified on the PARAM,GRDPNT ,x entry. If PARAM,GRDPNT,x is not specified, this
summation is performed about the origin of the basic coordinate system.  This operation is known as the
SPCFORCE RESULTANT output and this output is obtained if the SPCFORCES (Case)  output is requested.
It consists of seven lines of output per load case.  The SPCFORCE RESULTANT output for the problem
diag.dat is shown below:
Figure 10-21  SPCFORCE RESULTANT
Since the SPCFORCE  RESULTANT and OLOAD  RESULTANT are summed about the same reference
point, you would expect the total applied loads and total reaction loads to be equal and opposite of each other.
As indicated by Figure 10-19 and Figure 10-21, this is indeed the case.
Similar to the applied loads, you can also request more detailed information regarding where exactly on the
structure is reacting to these applied loads (grid point locations and directions).  These are also known as VERTICAL TIP LOAD                                                                            SUBCASE 1&lt;/p&gt;

boundary loads.  This operation can be done with the SPCFORCE request in the Case Control Section .  The
format is as follows:
SPCFORCE = All
or
SET 10 = 15, 16, 18, 25
SPCFORCE = 10
Figure 10-22  Single-Point Constraint Forces
In this case, since there is only one reaction  point (fixed at grid point 1) in the model, the SPCFORCE output
only contains one line of output per subcase (see Figure 10-22).  Some guidelines to consider when examining
the reaction loads include:
1.Are they equal to the applied loads?  Is the structure in equilibrium ?
2.Are the boundary loads coming out in the directions and magnitudes that you are expecting?  As an
example, if one of your reaction loads is to simulate a shear bolt and you are getting a tension reaction
load at that location, the chances are that you have modeled the boundary condition incorrectly.
3.Is the load distribution over the structure what you expect?  If not, you may want to go back and
check your modeling of your reaction points to make sure that they are what you intended.
4.Grid points with reaction force equal to 0.0 on all six components are suppressed from the printed
output.
1g Load
A 1g gravitation load applied separately in each of the three orthogonal directions is suggested for model
checkout.  This check is accomplished with three separate subcases.  This is a basic check to determine grid
points on the structure that are either loosely connected or have very small stiffnesses.  A displacement output
indicates that these points are moving excessively as compared to other parts of the model, especially if you
are using a postprocessor.  In order to use this feature, you must ensure that your structure contains masses-
either by direct masses (e.g., CONM2) or indirect masses (e.g., from the density on the MATi entries), or
nonstructural mass (e.g., a nonzero value on the NSM  field on the PBAR  entry).VERTICAL TIP LOAD                                                                  SUBCASE 1&lt;/p&gt;

Equilibrium Checks
A useful tool to ensure the validity and integrity of your finite element analysis solution in static analysis is
the equilibrium balance check. The EQUILIBRIUM (Case)  Case Control command automates the procedure to
produce a summation of the vector resultants (which should be zero if the solution is in equilibrium). This
is similiar to the steps performed in previous chapters with the individual LOAD, SPCF and MPCF
resultants.
Checking the equilibrium conditions at various steps is a simple and effective tool that can be used to detect
modeling difficulties and evaluate the quality of the solution.   For example, a column of the stiffness matrix
of a structure is a set of forces that develop when the degree of freedom represented by that column is given
a unit displacement.  If the resultant of those forces about any reference point is calculated, it should be zero
if no unintentional constraints are imposed.  It is also useful to compute and compare the resultants of the
applied loads and the constraint forces (single point as well as multi-point).  If they balance to zero,
confidence in the solution is increased.
The command can be used to specify a grid point to be used as the reference point for the summation.  Each
subcase can specify a different point, if desired.  If the point specified does not exist, the input vector
resultants are used without modification.  The origin of the basic coordinate system may also be specified as
the reference point.
The VECPLOT module performs the tasks associated with generation of the equilibrium results. This option
transforms the input force vectors to the basic system and computes the resultants with respect to the grid
point specified by the GRDPNT DMAP parameter.  If that point does not exist, the origin of the basic
coordinate system is used instead. The output is a summary listing of the force resultants and an Equilibrium
Check OFP output.
The EQUILIBRIUM command generates a total summation that includes the effects of all available force
vectors.  These force vectors are the applied loads, single point constraint forces and multi-point/rigid
element force vectors.  These vectors are produced by the presence of the associated Case Control commands,
LOAD (for applied loads), SPCF (for single point constraint forces) and MPCF (for multi-point/RBE
constraint forces).  If an EQUILIBRIUM command is present in the Case Control Section for a subcase, then
the program ensures computation of the SPCF and MPCF for the subcase.

Output of Maximum, Minimum Grid Point-Based Responses
MAXMIN Survey Output Request (old form)
Documenting the validation of a mathematical simulation model can be a very tedious and time consuming
process.  A portion of this process usually requires the generation of reports to completely describe the results
of the performed analysis.  Although a substantial amount of the reporting requirements can be satisfied
using graphical results plots, tabular data that summarizes the information depicted in the graphics are often
required.  Also, during the validation process itself, many tools are employed that assist users in evaluating
the results produced by the simulation.  Maximum/ minimum surveys of output quantities are one such tool
provided by the Case Control command, MAXMIN  (Case)  (old form).  See the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide&lt;br&gt;
for a complete description of this command.
With PARAM, PRTMAXIM ,YES and PARAM, PRTRESLT ,YES you can obtain simple surveys of grid point related
results output such as displacements, applied loads, and forces of single point constraint, where the output
consists of a summary that identifies the grid point at which the maximum and minimum values occurred
in each of the six output directions.  This information is provided for each subcase. But with the MAXMIN
command there are a lot more controls of the output.
The MAXMIN information appears as typical grid point related output.  Users can request a number of the
highest and lowest values for a particular component.  All components of the grid related quantities are
output together with the one component that is being surveyed.  For example, if 10 maximum and 10
minimum values of T3 displacements are requested, the output will also contain the T1, T2, R1, R2, and
R3 displacement values associated with the grid points identified in the T3 component survey.  The output
heading clearly identifies the component being surveyed.  Output can be surveyed for SUBCASEs and
SUBCOMs.  Other features include the capability to specify sets of points to be surveyed and coordinate
system to be used for the survey output.  Only SORT1 output is currently available.
If output coordinate systems are specified for any of the grid points being surveyed, the user has the option
of specifying one of several coordinate system views of the max/min output.  The data can be displayed in
the basic system, a local system, or even the global system.  Any grid point that is output in the max/min
survey will have its output presented in both the survey coordinate frame of reference and its original frame
of reference if they are different.  In this way, the user can see both the relative position of the grid point                                             E Q U I L I B R I U M   C H E C K

component in the max/min output as well as the original output quantities without having to research other
portions of the displacement output produced by the analysis.
The example problem maxmin.dat (see MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/maxmin.dat) demonstrates some
features available with the MAXMIN Case Control command.
The Case Control Section in Listing 10-3 shows the MAXMIN command at line 7 requests print and punch
of max/min survey results for all available output quantities generated and limited to component directions
T1 and T2 for grid points defined in case control set 100.  Because the command has been placed above the
subcase level, it applies to all subcases and subcoms.
The MAXMIN command at line 11 requests a survey of the forces of single point constraint output (keyword
SPCF) for component direction T1 only in the basic coordinate system frame of reference.  It also requests
that the highest and lowest 15 values be output considering ALL grid points.  Because it has been placed
within subcase 1000, it only pertains to that subcase.
The MAXMIN command at line 14 requests print and punch of max/min survey results for forces of single
point constraint.  A vector magnitude survey is requested for the four highest and lowest values.   The results
for these types of surveys appear in the columns of output normally containing component directions T1 and
R1.  Note that the specification of component directions to be surveyed (keyword COMP) has no effect in
this case.  All grid points will be included in the survey.
Listing 10-3  Case Control for MAXMIN (Old Form)
The MAXMIN survey output results in Listing 10-4 reveals that the three heading lines contain important
information that describe the options used to produce the results.  The first line identifies the component
direction that was searched, the type of output being searched, and the subcase/subcom identification
number.  The second line summarizes the options specified on the MAXMIN Case Control command used
to perform the search.  The third line contains column headings for the data values that follow in the output
listing.  Note that the field, TYPE, identifies whether it is a grid point (G) or scalar point (S) and the field,
POINT ID, identifies the grid point or scalar ID number. In addition, the coordinate system reference frame
for the output values is identified.  If data values for a point were transformed to a reference frame different
from the one originally defined in the output, then the data values for both frames of reference are output.  0                                        C A S E    C O N T R O L    E C H O                                                     &lt;br&gt;

This is shown in the output for the first grid point (ID = 2) in the sample output.  Here it is seen that values
for the forces of single point constraint are provided for the point  in the basic and CID 100 systems.  This
occurs because the output for the point has been specified in CID=100, but the max/min survey was
requested in the basic coordinate system.
Listing 10-4  MAXMIN (old form) Displacement Output
MAXMIN Output of Maximums and Minimums (new form)
The MAXMIN (new form) was designed for “sort2” data recovery such as in Modal T ransient solution (SOL
112).  However it can be used in statics sort1 to produce max/min output in a different format than old form.
The selection method is also different.
The MAXMIN(DEF) (Case)  Case Control command which must be above the subcase level defines the operations
to monitor. There can be multiple MAXMIN(DEF) entries. The MAXMIN (Case)  (new form) Case Control
commands below the subcase level select the data recovery quantities desired for each subcase.

where xxxxx describes the class being monitored, such as displacements for grids or element names for
stresses, forces or strains.
Using the same problem as maxmin old form the Case Control part of maxmina.dat (see
MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/maxmina.dat) has changed the DISPlacment output request from the old
form to the new form for the t1 and t2 components. (see Listing 10-5 lines 7 and 9). The output (see
Listing 10-6) shows the same displacement data results for subcase 1000 as Listing 10-4 but now the t1/t2
components are in the same listing.

Listing 10-6  MAXMIN Displacement Output (new form)
As an example of element output the Case Control part of mmq4es.dat (see
MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/mmq4es.dat) is shown. In Listing 10-7 lines 3and 9 show the request for quad4
element stress output in subcase 1001. The component numbers 9 and 17 were used instead of the NDDL
names because these components names changed from SMAX to TMAX, but the numbers are the same.

Model Verification
Main Index
The Listing 10-8 shows the max/min summary requested plus the normal quad4 stress output. Note the
element reference system may not be consistent, so it is suggested that the invariant be used to determine the
ordering for two dimensional elements.  In the results presented the SHEAR invariant was selected.&lt;br&gt;

Unconstrained Equilibrium Check
If a structure is truly unconstrained, then movement at one point of this structure should cause the whole
structure to move as a rigid body.  The following procedure can be used to perform this check.
1.Remove all the constraints.                                                                                                               SUBCASE 1001        &lt;br&gt;

2.Apply a unit enforced displacement in the x-direction at one selected grid point while constraining
the other five components at this selected grid point to zero.  This grid point should be close to the
center of gravity (C.G.) of the structure, although this is not a requirement.  The x-displacements at
all the other grid points should also be equal to unity if the structure is truly unconstrained.  If the
displacement at a certain grid point is not equal to unity in the x-direction, it is very likely that it
overstrained.  The likely causes for this can include incorrect modeling of rigid elements, offset
beams, non-colinear CELASi, etc.  See Constraints  for details regarding enforced displacement.
3.Repeat the same procedure for the other two orthogonal directions.  You can perform similar checks
for rotations; however, it is more difficult to interpret the results.
At the conclusion of this check, you should remember to put your original constraints back into your model.
Unintentional Grounding (GROUNDCHECK)
In addition to the unconstrained equilibrium check mentioned above, you may also request a more robust
and more automatic grounding check of the stiffness matrix. This grounding check is also referred to as rigid
body check because the stiffness matrix is multiplied by the rigid body transformation matrix. The grounding
check identifies unintentional constraints and ill-conditioning in the stiffness matrix.
The grounding check is requested with the GROUNDCHECK (Case)  Case Control command.
For example, the following command
GROUNDCHECK=YES
will request a grounding check of the g-set.  The following command
GROUNDCHECK(SET=ALL)=YES
will request a grounding check of all DOF sets.
The check may be performed at any or all stages of the stiffness reduction based on the specification of the
SET keyword.GROUNDCHECKPRINT

The THRESH keyword specifies the maximum strain energy that passes the grounding check.&lt;br&gt;
DATAREC=YES  requests data recovery of grounding forces.  The RTHRESH=r keyword prints the
grounding forces larger than r percent of the largest grounding force if DATAREC is set to YES.
User Information Message 7570 is issued by GROUNDCHECK for each DOF set requested.  The strain
energy is computed in each direction of the rigid body motion and by default, if the strain energy exceeds the
tolerance, then “FAIL” is printed out for that directory. The tolerance is set by dividing the largest stiffness
term by 1.E10. The THRESH keyword can be used to further control the amount of output (see Sample
Output Listings  (App. A)). Possible reasons for failure are also printed after the strain energies.  Here is an
example for the g-set that indicates the stiffness matrix passes the grounding check in all six rigid body
directions:

If the DATAREC keyword is specified and the rigid body check fails then data recovery will be performed to
compute and print the grounding forces to make it easy to locate the source of the failure.  By default, only
those grounding forces larger than 10 percent of the largest grounding force will be printed (see RTHRESH
keyword).  Here is an example of grounding forces created by moving the model in rigid body direction 1
associated with the f-set failure shown above:
Thermal Equilibrium Check
The following procedure can also be used to check for unconstrained thermal expansion if the structure is
going to be subjected to thermal loads.
1.Remove the actual boundary conditions and apply a set of statically determinate constraints.&lt;br&gt;
Typically this procedure is done by constraining all six DOFs at a single grid point.  If a single grid
point is used, make sure this single grid point contains six degrees of freedom.  A single grid point of
a model consisting of all solid elements, for example, cannot satisfy this requirement since each grid
point of a solid element contains only three degrees of freedom.
2.Change all the thermal coefficients of expansion  to a single value.
3.Apply a uniform T to the structure.
If the model is “clean,” then the structure should be strain free; in other words, there should be no reaction
loads, element forces, or stresses.  If this is not the case, then you may want to investigate around the vicinity
where the element forces or stresses are nonzero.  Incorrect modeling of rigid elements or offsets is a common
cause of these types of errors.  Once you are satisfied with your model, remember to change the boundary
condition, thermal coefficients of expansion, and T back to their original values.
Grid Point Force Balance
Frequently, there are several elements connected to a single grid point.  When this happens, you may want
to know how the loads are distributed among these elements at the common grid point.  In other words, you  *** USER INFORMATION MESSAGE 7570 (GPWG1D)                                 &lt;br&gt;

want to understand the load path.  Is the load path correct?  These questions can be answered by using the
GPFORCE  (grid point force) option in MSC Nastran.
Grid point force balance is computed only from linear stiffness elements, the sum of applied loads and
thermal loads, MPC forces, rigid elements, general elements, DMIG entries and SPC  forces.  Effects not
accounted for include those from mass elements in dynamic analysis (inertia loads) and boundary loads from
upstream superelements.  These effects may lead to an apparent lack of equilibrium at the grid point level.
Table 10-2 summarizes those effects that are considered and those effects that are ignored in the calculation of
grid point forces in the global coordinate system .
The model in Figure 10-23 illustrates this feature.  This model consists of nine CQUAD4  and six CBAR&lt;br&gt;
elements and is subjected to vertical loads applied at the free end.  The partial input file is shown in
Listing 10-9. For the incorrect PBAR see MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/q4bargpf.dat and for the correct
PBAR, see MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/q4bargpfc.dat.

If everything is done correctly, expect the stress contour plot  to look something like Figure 10-24 (a).  However,
say that you made a modeling mistake somewhere, and the stress contour plot is coming out as shown in
Figure 10-24(b).  You know that something is wrong because the stress contour plot is not symmetrical.  Since
the structure, boundary conditions, and applied loads are all symmetrical, you also expect the stress contour
plot to be symmetrical.  By inspecting the grid point force balance output ( Figure 10-25), you notice that the
stiffeners (CBAR 104, 105, and 106) are not picking up any axial, vertical, or out-of-plane bending loads at
grid points 9, 10, 11, and 12 as they are all zero.
A review of the input file explains the reason for this result.  The area (A) and the out-of-plane bending
moment of inertia (I1) were &amp;ldquo;accidentally&amp;rdquo; left out for CBAR  elements 104, 105, and 106 (PBAR 200).&lt;br&gt;
Hence, all the axial and out-of-plane bending loads at grid points 9, 10, 11, and 12 were picked up completely
by the surrounding CQUAD4  elements.  By correcting the PBAR element properties, note that CBAR
elements 104, 105, and 106 now pick up the correct loads as shown in Figure 10-26.&lt;/p&gt;

Figure 10-26  Grid Point Force Balance Output for a Model with Correct CBAR Properties
Both Figure 10-25 and Figure 10-26 are reduced versions of the full output.  Only the grid point force balance
output as related to grid points 1, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 16 are shown in these two figures for clarity.  Notice that
for grid points 1 and 9, in addition to the elastic element forces, the SPC forces are also printed.  Similarly,
for grid points 12 and 16, the applied loads are also printed.  As you can see, the grid point force balance
feature can provide you with a tremendous insight regarding the load path of your structure.
Stress Error Estimators
Grid Point Stresses , 363 is devoted to a discussion of the averaging procedures utilized to provide meaningful
stresses at the grid points of finite element models in MSC Nastran.  However, when you look at a stress
distribution, frequently you may not be sure of whether further model refinement is necessary.  This section
focuses upon the description of error estimators to assist you in the identification of regions of your model
that may require refinement.
The essence of the averaging procedures used to obtain grid point stress data are to:
1.Convert these local element stress components into a common coordinate system defined by you.
2.Average several values of each stress component to obtain a unique value of the stress component that
is to be associated with the grid point in question.
3.Compute the stress invariants  at the grid points from the stress components at the grid points.

This stress error assessment is often referred to as stress discontinuity , and it is evaluated in two different ways
in MSC Nastran.  The stress discontinuity is evaluated as grid point and element stress discontinuities.
The element and grid point stress discontinuity output can only be obtained if the grid point stress output
is requested via the STRFIELD (Case)  Case Control Command.  The STRFIELD Case Control command is also
used for graphical postprocessing of grid point stress, element stress discontinuity, and grid point stress
discontinuity.  The STRFIELD command, however, does not provide printed output for the grid point
stress.  The GPSTRESS (Case)  Case Control command is needed if printed output for the grid point stress is
desired.  Similar to the GPSTRESS command, the STRFIELD command also requires that you define all
applicable SURFACE s and VOLUME s in the OUTPUT(POST)  portion of the Case Control Section.  Element
stresses (STRESS) must also be requested for those elements that lie on the SURFACEs and/or VOLUMEs.&lt;br&gt;
For a more detailed description of GPSTRESS, refer to Grid Point Stresses .
Then the  GPSDCON (Case)  Case Control command requests grid point stress discontinuity output and/or
ELSDCON (Case)  requests element stress discontinuity output.
The following remarks apply to the use of the GPSDCON and/or ELSDCON commands.
1.They are only supported in Solution Sequence101.
2.They may be placed above the SUBCASE level or in individual SUBCASEs and/or SUBCOMs.  The
use of these commands above the SUBCASE level causes the stress discontinuity data to be output
for all SUBCASEs in the MSC Nastran input file.
3.These commands can produce a substantial amount of data.
4.Stress continuity data is not provided when both plate and solid elements are connected to a grid
point that is involved in stress discontinuity calculations.
Grid Point Stress Discontinuities
To illustrate the discontinuities requests, consider the following portion of a finite element model consisting
of CQUAD4 elements.  For clarity, only a portion of the model is plotted.  These elements lie on a surface
(defined as surface 91 in this case).&lt;/p&gt;

Table 10-5  The Values of  and ERROR ESTIMATE for CQUAD4 Element Grid 61
(X = 28.5, Y = 1.5
The following remarks should be noted in regard to Table 10-3 and Table 10-5.
1.By default, the stress components for the CQUAD4 elements are only output at the element
centroids.
2.If vertex stresses are also desired for the CQUAD4 elements, then use the STRESS(CORNER) = x
option in the Case Control Section. This output corresponds to the last rows of the tables
3.The calculation of  g for the CQUAD4 elements involve grid point stresses and element stresses
provided at a different geometric location if the default center option is requested. They are evaluated
at the same location when using the corner option.
Smaller values of g and the ERROR ESTIMATE are obtained from the corner stress request. In addition to
values of g for each stress component and the ERROR ESTIMATE MSC Nastran output also contains
values of g for each of the stress invariants. These quantities are output for each grid point in the defined
SURFACE  (plate elements) or VOLUME  (solid elements).Table 10-4&lt;br&gt;

Element Stress Discontinuities
Other statistical error estimates may be generated by associating the estimates with the elements rather than
with the grid points.  For example, root mean square errors for each stress component of an element may be
computed from the values of ei that are computed for each of the g connected vertex grid points.  This
computation is done for each stress component for all of the elements of interest. (The results ( e and
ERROR ESTIMATE) from MSC Nastran for the same examples, using CQUAD4 and CQUAD4 with the
corner option for elements 20 and 60, are summarized in Table 10-7 and Table 10-9.
Table 10-7  The Values of  and ERROR ESTIMATE for Different Plate Element Types
Table 10-9  The Values of e and ERROR ESTIMATE for Different Plate Element Types
In addition to values of (e) for each stress component and the ERROR ESTIMATE, MSC Nastran output
also contains values of for each of the stress invariants. For plate elements, all of these quantities are output
at the neutral plane and at fiber distances Z1 and Z2 for each element in the defined SURFACE .
Discussion of Error Measures
An examination of Table 10-3 through Table 10-9 shows that the error estimates  for CQUAD4 elements
without vertex stress data are substantially larger than the corresponding error estimates for those elements
that provide vertex stress data as a default. In view of the fact that the finite model under discussion was
constructed with a rather high mesh density to produce results that agreed very closely with theory, you may
perhaps be surprised by the large values of the error estimates for those elements that only provide stress data
at the element centroid.Table 10-8&lt;br&gt;

Main Index
These seemingly large values of error estimators for CQUAD4 elements are not uncommon occurrences in
statistical error measures.  For example, the mean and variance have direct analogies in engineering
mechanics.  The mean is analogous to the centroid of a body and is thus a measure of where the mass is
centered.  The variance is the second moment about the mean, and it tends to be small if the majority of the
mass is concentrated about the centroid.  As the mass is dispersed further from the centroid, the moment of
inertia tends to increase. If the mass is concentrated at the centroid (as it might be in some idealized lumped
mass models), the moment of inertia becomes zero.
Thus, the error estimates for CQUAD4 elements tend toward larger values because the data used to compute
the estimators is dispersed relatively far from the mean.  For those elements that provide stress data at vertices,
the estimators tend toward smaller values because the stress data tends to be concentrated about the mean in
well-designed finite element models.
Generally, you should design a finite element mesh for static analysis so that all important stress gradients are
adequately represented.  If the mesh is not of sufficient detail, the stress data whether available at element
vertices or at element centroids results in the relatively large values of the error estimators discussed here.
You are cautioned that very inaccurate values of these error estimators may occur at the edges of defined
SURFACEs and on the faces of defined VOLUMEs.  In summary, the error estimators under discussion can,
in some cases, be highly inaccurate.  Nevertheless, these data are quite useful when interpreted properly.
Postprocessor Checks
Once you have completed your MSC Nastran job, you are now faced with perhaps the most important task-
-interpreting the results.  After all, the whole purpose of performing an analysis is the ability to reap rewards
from the results of your analysis.  For a large model, it becomes impractical to go through every page of your
output to look at the results.  A postprocessor is a graphical tool that helps you siphon and interpret a
voluminous amount of output data.  This section covers some of the basic output quantities that you may
want to consider when using a postprocessor .
Displacement
Prior to your analysis, you should have an approximate idea of how your structure is going to behave.  A
displacement  plot should be created for each of your loading conditions.  You should be convinced that the
results are reasonable; otherwise, further investigation is warranted.
If there are abrupt changes in the displacements at a certain region, you may want to zoom in to inspect that
local region and see if they are justifiable.  One possible cause can be improper modeling at that location or
certain elements not being connected.
Stress Contours
Stress contour plots are calculated using a stress averaging technique of neighboring elements.  Once these
average stresses are calculated, the postprocessor assigns different colors to these stresses based on the stress
ranges.  These stresses can then be plotted as stress contour plots with various colors designating different
stress ranges.  This feature is probably the most frequently used postprocessing option.  When used properly,
it can help you quickly identify high stress regions and provide you with insight regarding your model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;445 CHAPTER 10
Model Verification
Main Index
When you create stress contour plots  of component stresses, you should ensure that the component that you
are plotting is in a consistent direction for all the elements that are included in your plot.  The default
component direction may be a function of element type.  Some postprocessing packages may also transform
them into a common coordinate system.  The following example problem in Figure 10-28 illustrates the
importance of consistent direction.  The stresses in a CQUAD4  element are in terms of the element
coordinate system (see MSC Nastran Elements  and the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide ).

In this example, the connectivities for both CQUAD4  elements are described in a consistent manner as
shown in Figure 10-29.  Due to this consistency, the corresponding component stresses, e.g.,  point in the same
direction for both elements.  Note that  for this model is equal to zero for both elements.
Figure 10-29  Consistent Connectivity
If you perform a stress contour on this model using x, the contour plot for x across the two elements can
be calculated as follows:
The contour plot for  across the two elements can be calculated as follows:
On the other hand, if the two elements are not connected in a consistent matter as shown in Figure 10-30,
then the corresponding component stresses (e.g. x, ) do not necessarily point in the same directions for both
elements.  As shown in Figure 10-30, the x component stresses point in the directions of the x- and y-axis for
elements 1 and 2, respectively.1

Once again, if you perform a stress contour on this model using , the value used in the contour plot for  across
the two elements in this case is as follows:
As you can see, the x value used in the contour plot for this case is basically meaningless and could lead you
to an erroneous conclusion.
The von Mises stresses  used for the contour plot can be calculated as follows:

and the two input files are then identical.
As you have probably observed by now, using contour plots of component stresses can lead to misleading
results unless they are transformed into a common coordinate system.  Therefore, in most instances, it is
generally easier and more meaningful to look at the invariant stress quantities, such as von Mises stresses ,
instead of the component stresses.  However, there are situations where you may want to look at component
stresses.  An example is a cylindrical model whereby you are interested in looking at the hoop stress.  In this
case, you should be aware of the consequences if your model is not created in a consistent  manner.  Alternate
invariant stress quantities are the principal stresses .
Grid Point Stress and Stress Discontinuity Plots
The grid point stress feature enables you to obtain stress output at the grid points instead of the elements.&lt;br&gt;
This feature is described in detail in Grid Point Stresses .  If the contour plot using grid point stress is
substantially different from the contour plot using element stress, it is probably an indication that the model
needs to be refined or that you may have inconsistent element orientations as described in the previous
section.
Stress discontinuity is a measure of the probable error of the stresses across the grid points or elements.  This
type of plot assists you in the identification of regions of your model that may require refinement.  This
feature is discussed in detail in Stress Error Estimators .
Element Strain Energy Plots
The element strain energy plot is an excellent tool for identifying areas that are most effective in influencing
your design.  For a large model, this output request can generate a large amount of printed output.  The plot
option can be used to generate plots without generating printed output.  This feature is discussed in detail
in Strain Energy Output .
Monitor Points
Introduction
Monitor Points is a generic term used to refer to four different user input quantities that the user can select
to provide a snapshot of the results of a structural analysis that is particularly meaningful to the engineering
end-user. While Monitor Points were developed with aeroelastic considerations in mind, they have
applicability in any type of analysis. This guide will focus on Sol 101, but it is also available in
103,108,109,111,112,144, 146 and 200. Monitor Points refer to the MONITOR Case Control command
and to the Bulk Data entries shown below.  They can be used to obtain an understanding of critical load paths
across the subcases. The user can recover results at a particular location and output coordinate system of his
choosing.
The coordinate system the results are most conveniently expressed in, may not be the same as those used in
computing the monitor point results, so the output coordinate system on the MONPNT1, MONPNT3 and
MONDPS1 entries facilitates communication among groups and makes the results consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Linear Statics Analysis User’s Guide
Monitor Points450
Main Index
Also the ability to transfer moments allows the specification of a monitor point location that is apart from
the finite element model and thereby facilitates communications between the loads group and the stress
group in the aircraft development process.
User Interface
The MSC Nastran user interface starts with the MONITOR (Case)  Case Control command, which provides
control over the printing of the monitor points results. T oggles can be used to control the print of the
individual monitor types. This command must be placed above the subcase level or in the first subcase and
applies to all subcases.
The MONPNT1  Bulk Data entry provides integrated loads at a user defined point in a user defined coordinate
system. The user also identifies the nodes whose loads are to be integrated. The user can then extract the
applied loading for the specified set of structural nodes. This enables the batch calculation of VMT (shear,
moment and torque) data.
Note that the loads are specified by the COMP field that, in turn, identifies a AECOMP entry that selects
SET1 entry for structural grids.
The MONPNT2  Bulk Data entry provides element results from the TABLEs Stress, Strain, or Force in a
tabulated fashion. This can be used to pinpoint a particular response for output, as opposed to finding a
particular item in a large OFP listing.  For the results to be accurate, the term selected must be a linear
function of the displacements.
The user must identify the element TYPE and NDDL item.  The type and nddl item is obtained from the
nddl description for each table. See QRG Remark 5 of this entry. There are separate types for composite and
element corner results.&lt;br&gt;
The MONPNT3  Bulk Data entry provides a summation of grid point forces at user specified integration points
and in a user defined coordinate system. The summation of the internal loads is useful in calculating resultant
forces at a cut in the structure.  This can be used to provide the net load acting at a fuselage or wing station
by making a “cut” in the structure and then identifying all the grids and elements on one side of the cut
The entry NAME is identified with a piece of structure by listing the elements and nodes associated with it.&lt;br&gt;
The grid point force data associated with these entities is then integrated to the location specified on the entry.&lt;br&gt;
The XFLAG can be used to exclude certain grid point force types from consideration.
The MONDSP1  Bulk Data entry allows for the sampling of a displacement vector to create a blended
displacement response at a user specified point and coordinate system.  The displacement monitor point is
essentially an RBE3 element (limited to a single dependent point) and the dependent grid is now an arbitrary
point. The averaged displacement can be seen as providing a qualitative assessment of the elastic deflection
of a vehicle. An example is to monitor the nominal pitch and plunge at a station along the wing.
This entry is similar to the MONPNT1 entry but now it is displacements that are being averaged. As with
the MONPNT1, the COMP field, points to a AECOMP entry which specifies a SET1 entry or entries that
specify the grids to be monitored.
The MONSUM  Bulk Data entry defines a new monitor result that is the weighted sum of existing monitor
results. The existing monitor points do not need to be of the same type but they must be of similar type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;451 CHAPTER 10
Model Verification
Main Index
This entry can be used for both updating and summing of monitor point results. It allows for the
modification of existing component results from MONDSP1, MONPNT1 and MONPNT3. A scalar
multiple can provide, for example, a change in sign or a change in units.  Enabling the weighted summation
or two or more MONDSP1, MONPNT1 or MONPNT3’s, that are of the same type, can provide the ability
to present running results along a wing or fuselage.
The MONSUM1  Bulk data entry specifies the location of the summed quantity. This enables the summation of
monitor points from disparate points to a single location.
The first continuation defines a CP ,X,Y,Z, CD combination that specifies the point where the summation is
said to occur and performs the summation using the equation provided below. By contrast, the MONSUM
does not specify the location and therefore cannot be used in subsequent MONSUMT processing.
The MONSUM1 does not support the combination of MONDSP1’s since no physically meaningful
interpretation or application can be envisioned for combining MONDSP1’s in this manner.
The underlying equation that is executed for the MONSUM1 is:
Where MRi is the result from the individual component.
Relative to the MONSUM, the MONSUM1 allows the user to specify where the summed output is
requested. MSC Nastran uses this information plus the locations of the referenced monitor points that are
being summed to perform a coordinate transformation as part of the summation.
The MONSUMT  Bulk data entry provides the ability to transfer moments and thereby allows the specification
of a monitor point location that is apart from the finite element model. This facilitates communication
between the loads group and the stress group in the development/simulation process.
With the MONSUMT entry moment transfers do occur.  The first continuation defines a CP ,X,Y,Z, CD
combination that specifies the point where the loads are to be monitored and performs the
summation/transfer using the equation provided below.   By contrast, the MONSUM1 location is user
specified and does not involve moment transfer.
The MONSUMT like MONSUM1 does not support the combination of MONDSP1’s since no physically
meaningful interpretation or application can be envisioned for combining MONDSP1’s in this manner.
The MONSUMT can reference the results of another MONSUMT or MONSUM1 as long as there is not
a circular reference.
The underlying equation that is executed for the MONSUMT is:
Where Tij is a partial rigid body vector for the location of the monitor points being summed and MRi is the
result from the individual component. n

MONPNT2 produces a line of data for each subcase. The rest contain as many rows as the number of
components specified in the AXES field. Be sure to use quantities that are a linear function of the solutions.
This is not the case for synthesized responses such as von Mises stress. The MONSUM just multiplied
components 1,2 and 4 of the MONPNT1 values by 2.0.
Example 2
The MSC Nastran TPL has a subdirectory “monsum1” that contains a series of simple examples that apply
the MONSUM1 and MONSUMT entries across a variety of solution sequences.
A very simple example is monsum1101. This is a cantilevered beam example where the beam is of length 10
units and has a load of magnitude 10.0 applied at the half span. the example includes a MONSUM a
MONSUM1 and MONSUMT , all of which are applied to one MONPNT1 that is calculated at the half
span and another that is at the tip.
The results are shown below.        MONITOR POINT NAME = SCALE             COMPONENT = &lt;strong&gt;SUM&lt;/strong&gt;           CLASS = GENERAL                       SUBCASE NO.     3

The MONSUM (DALE) simply adds these two MONPNT1&amp;rsquo;s together resulting in a Z force of 20.0 and a
moment about the y axis of 50.0 (from the monpnt1 at the tip).  For the MONSUM, there is no output
location so there is a message that &amp;ldquo;CP , X, Y, Z and CD are not defined for monitor points results created
from a MONSUM.&amp;rdquo; The MONSUM1 (DALE1) also adds the results together, but now the user has
specified an output location so that CP , X, Y, Z and CD locations as input by the user are included in the
output.  This specification has no effect on the results relative to the MONSUM.  Finally the MONSUMT
(DALET) is located at the tip so now the MONPNT1 at the half span contributes a moment so that the Z
force is again 20.0 but the moment is 100.0 (=50. + 5.0 * 10.0)

Summary
Many model verification tools have been presented in this chapter.  We are not suggesting that you have to
perform all these checks for all your models nor that they are the only ones to perform.  The less familiar you
are with your model, the more checks you probably should perform.  But by performing these checks, you
will notice errors that might otherwise have gone undetected.  You will benefit by producing a much higher
quality production finite element model.&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction to Inertia Relief456
Main Index
Introduction to Inertia Relief
Inertia relief is an advanced option in MSC Nastran that allows you to simulate unconstrained structures in
a static analysis. It enables applied static loading to an unconstrained structure and the calculation of
deformed shape and internal loads within the accelerated structure. Inertia relief calculates the rigid body
mass x acceleration loads imparted by the applied loads, and applies them in combination to the flexible body
to produce a load-balanced static formulation in the linear acceleration reference frame. The “steady-state”
relative structural displacements and internal loads are calculated using suport entries (PARAM,INREL,-1)
or automatically, the no suport capability (PARAM,INREL,-2). Typical applications of inertia relief include
modeling an aircraft in flight, an automobile on a test track, or a satellite in space.
Inertia relief is commonly used to measure inertial compliance or dynamic stiffness of an unconstrained
component under attachment loads or under center of gravity unit loads. Inertia relief has the valuable
property within SOL 101 of providing the static-dynamic convergence shape and elastic modes solution of a
dynamically loaded free-free structure as  hz in SOL 111 (using PARAM,LFREQ and residual load
vectors).
Although the internal processing is somewhat complex, the interface to the inertia relief option is quite
straightforward. There are two ways to invoke the inertia relief. The first method is to specify the SUPORT
entry explicitly by including “ PARAM, INREL,-1” in the Bulk Data Section. The second method (the
recommended method) is to let MSC Nastran select the SUPORT degrees of freedom automatically by
including “PARAM,INREL,-2” in the Bulk Data Section. An optional “PARAM, GRDPNT,x”&amp;ndash;where x is a
grid point ID&amp;ndash;can be specified in the model. If “PARAM,GRDPNT,x” is used, the loads and accelerations
will be summed about this point. If “PARAM,GRDPNT ,x” is not specified, then the loads and accelerations
will be summed about the origin of the basic coordinate system.
The constraints associated with the reference frame are distributed to all points with mass.  This means that
structures with modeling errors, such as a region of elements left out through oversight, will still give
reasonable results that can aid in diagnosing the modeling errors.  A model in development may contain many
disjoint parts, inadvertently.  Any part with three non-collinear points with mass will be adequately
constrained for solution.
In the manual support option, the free stiffness matrix Kaa is constrained by removing the r-set DOFs from
the a-set and imposing zero motion on them,
(11-1)
(11-2)
With the automatic inertia relief, the  variables are no longer a subset of the  variables.  The constraint
equation, Equation (11-2), is replaced by a more general constraint equation,
(11-3)
The variables  are a set of generalized coordinates that represent the average motion of the  variables,
as weighted by the mass matrix.  The zero value for this equation implies that the average motion of all a-set f0

points is zero, although the displacement variables are free to move relative to this least-squares fit reference
frame.&lt;br&gt;
The manual style of inertia relief allows use of PARAM,GRDPNT to define the origin used in determining
the shape functions .  The presence of this parameter causes the output of the Grid Point Weight
Generator (GPWG) table, which lists the c.g. location of the model, its moments of inertia, and other related
data. This point in space is used as the reference point when computing rigid body mass and moments of
inertia, and rigid body accelerations.  If the parameter is not present, the basic origin is used, in the basic
coordinate system.  It is good practice (but not required by MSC Nastran) to use the same grid point on
PARAM,GRDPNT and on the SUPORT entry.&lt;br&gt;
Unlike the manual option, PARAM,GRDPNT is not used as the inertia relief reference point for the
automatic support option.  The basic origin is used.  If the PARAM,GRDPNT is present, it causes the
generation of the GPWG table, but does not influence the inertia relief calculations in any way.
The constraint forces caused by the distributed constraints are printed with the SPCFORCE case control
command.  They are computational zeros for a well-defined model.  PARAM,TINY (default value is 1.E-3)
is traditionally used to discard element strain energies with values less than “tiny”.  The same parameter
requests that small SPC forces of the reference frame constraint type be replaced with binary zeros, for the
automatic support option only.  This filtering is not used on conventional SPC forces from selected SPC
entries or AUTOSPC, and manual support DOFs.
PARAM,INREL,-2, provides the following enhancements to inertia relief analysis:
1.Auto-suport (SUPORT entries are not required) for the 6 rigid body motions of an unconstrained
connected structure.
2.Unique displacement solution that is decoupled from rigid body motion and identical to SOL 111
elastic modes static solution as  Hz.
3.Improved accuracy in internal loads and stress calculations in “difficult-to-suport” models.
There is no actual Suport of grids or scalar points in the Inrel = -2 implementation. Unlike INREL = -1, there
are no enforced zeroes or “center of displacement.” The INREL = -2 solution typically balances around the
CG of the structure, with the CG displacing slightly in the direction of the applied loads. This “balance”
differs for each applied load P. INREL = -2 uses PARAM,GRDPNT and rigid body acceleration as a
geometric reference, not required to be part of structure or independent a-set.
Guidelines for Inertia Relief
1.Inertia relief analysis requires that the model have inertia, that is, mass. This is easily accomplished
for most models by use of the RHO field (mass density) on the MATi Bulk Data entries. Line
structures, such as a shaft made from BAR elements, may not have moments of inertia along the
torsion axis. Use either BEAM elements, which can have torsion mass moments of inertia, or add
inertia terms with CONM2 entries.
2.INREL = -2 with auto-suport is designed for the common 6 rigid-body-mode unconstrained
connected model. If the model is intended to have exactly 6 rigid body modes, then INREL = -2 is
the most convenient and numerically stable option. SUPORTi entries must NOT be used.Da6
f0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Linear Statics Analysis User’s Guide
Inertia Relief Using PARAM,INREL,-1 (SUPORT)458
Main Index
3.If the model is semi-constrained with &amp;lt; 6 rigid body modes, including 1-D or 2-D models, INREL
= -1 is recommended, using &amp;lt; 6 appropriate suport DOF.
4.Inertia relief is not recommended on models with extra mechanisms or unconnected parts with mass,
with &amp;gt; 6 zero Hz modes. INREL = -1 will fatal with suports &amp;gt; 6, and INREL = -2 with auto-suport
will fatal or give unreliable results.
5.For models with local or massless singularities beyond the 6 rigid body modes, INREL = -2 with auto-
suport can produce a reasonable result. But care should be taken, and singular DOF with high factor
diagonals in the .f06 should be checked.
6.PARAM,GRDPNT is the reference point for INREL = -2. If default (0,0,0) is far from the model
CG, then GRDPNT should be defined at or near the CG.
7.When SUPORTi entries are used in INREL = -1, a good rule of thumb is that they be on structure
strong and balanced enough to sustain the weight of the structure in a laboratory test (they must have
significant stiffness). If the structure does not have such DOFs, a new grid can be defined as a
reference node, and connected to many DOFs with an RBE3 element. The reference node must be
in the n-set which implies that the UM feature of the RBE3 element must be used.
8.Inrel = -1 SUPORTi entries must constitute a statically determinate set . Good selections are
either: a) all DOF at CG, or b) DOF distanced out in 3-2-1 fashion to create a good balance of the
structure. See discussion in INREL = -1 section.
9.INREL = -2 should be used if the inertia relief solution is intended to match the SOL 111  Hz
elastic solution exactly.
10. INREL = -1 should be used if a zeroed “center of displacement” is desired.
11. Both inertia relief methods are most accurate on ungrounded “clean” models with rigid body modes
on the order E-4 less than first flexible mode frequency. Case Control command,
GROUNDCHECK, can be helpful in detecting grounding problems. For INREL = -1, Suport Strain
Energy in .f06 should also be checked. The INREL = -2 method remains more robust and accurate,
as long as 6 rigid modes are intended and remain fairly distinct from the 7th mode. For models where
separation between 6th and 7th mode is less than E-1, then INREL = -1 with good suport selection
should be considered as well.
Inertia Relief Using PARAM,INREL,-1 (SUPORT)
As discussed previously, static analysis by the finite element method assumes that the model contains no
mechanisms and may not move as a rigid body (strain free).  If either of these conditions exists in a
conventional finite element analysis, the stiffness matrix for the model becomes singular.  When
MSC Nastran attempts to decompose a singular matrix, a fatal message or unreasonable answers result.
Consequently, conventional finite element static analysis cannot be performed on unconstrained structures.&lt;br&gt;
However, a method called inertia relief is provided in MSC Nastran for analyzing these conditions.  A simple
description of inertia relief is that the inertia (mass) of the structure is used to resist the applied loadings, that
is, an assumption is made that the structure is in a state of static equilibrium even though it is not constrained.&lt;br&gt;
T wo examples are a spacecraft in orbit or an aircraft in flight.  In these cases, the structure is in state of static
equilibrium, although it is capable of unconstrained motion. 6

In addition to the PARAM, INREL ,-1 entry, a SUPORT  entry is also needed.  If PARAM, GRDPNT,x is specified,
the rigid body mass matrix is calculated about grid point x; otherwise, the rigid body mass is calculated about
the origin of the basic coordinate system.  The inertia relief method requires that a realistic mass distribution
exists, and the degrees of freedom listed on the SUPORT entry must be connected elastically to the model
in all specified degrees of freedom.  (For example, degrees of freedom 4, 5, and 6 on a grid point with only
solid elements attached cannot be used since solid elements have no stiffness in these degrees of freedom.)
To invoke inertia relief, you must provide a SUPORT  Bulk Data entry with a list of up to six non-redundant
degrees of freedom that describe the possible unconstrained motion.  The easiest way to describe how to use
the SUPORT entry in static analysis is if you hold the SUPORT degrees of freedom constrained, there is no
possible rigid body motion.  If all possible rigid body motion is not described on the SUPORT entry, then
the stiffness matrix is singular, and the problem either fails in decomposition or gives unreasonable answers.
When inertia relief is specified, MSC Nastran calculates the forces that result from a rigid body acceleration
about the point specified on the “ PARAM, GRDPNT,x” in the specified directions.  MSC Nastran then
calculates the summation of all applied loadings in the same directions.  Accelerations are applied to the
structure in the appropriate directions to “balance” the applied loadings.  The structure is now in a state of
static equilibrium, i.e., the summation of all applied loads is 0.0.  Since the problem is not constrained, rigid
body displacement is still possible.&lt;br&gt;
The next step performed by MSC Nastran is to constrain the SUPORT degrees of freedom to a displacement
of 0.0 and provide the relative motion of all other grid points with respect to that reference point.  Hence,
the term “reference” degree of freedom  is used to describe the SUPORT degrees of freedom in MSC Nastran.&lt;br&gt;
The set of degrees of freedom described on the SUPORT entry belong to the r-set or reference set for the
solution.  The computed solution is the correct one, and it is relative to any rigid body motion that is
occurring.  A simple way to think of this is that the solution coming from MSC Nastran represents the
deformation of the structure you would see if you were standing at the SUPORT degrees of freedom.
The SUPORT entry lists the DOFs in the r-set, the reference set.  Some skill is required to use this entry
correctly. When the r-set is chosen such that structure is not constrained in a statically determinate manner,
or if the stiffness attached to these points is inadequate, the rigid body mode shapes may be poor, leading to
low accuracy in inertial load calculations.  A poor static analysis solution may also result from the poor
constraints, independent of the loading problems.  Both effects may result in poor overall accuracy.  Poor
results can occur with little warning when the SUPORT entry is misused.
Solution 101 requires that the model does not contain mechanisms.  The reference degrees of freedom are
specified using the the SUPORT entry as follows:
SUPORT
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
SUPORT ID1 C1 ID2 C2 ID3 C3 ID4 C4
Field Contents
IDi Grid or scalar point identification  number.
Ci Component numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

Whenever a SUPORT entry is used in static analysis, the epsilon and strain energy printed in the table from
UIM 3035 should be checked.  The values printed for epsilon  and strain energy  in the UIM 3035 table
should all be numeric zero.  The strain energy printed in this table for matrix KLR represents the strain energy
in the model when the one SUPORT degree of freedom is moved 1.0 unit, while all other SUPORT degrees
of freedom are constrained.  If the SUPORT degrees of freedom are properly specified, the model should be
capable of rigid body motion (strain-free) with no strain energy.
The values printed for the strain energy indicate the ability of the model to move as a rigid body.  These values
should always be checked.  If the structure is not constrained, the values should be numeric zero, but roundoff
almost always results in a small nonzero value.  Acceptable values are a function of the units, size of the
structure, and precision of the hardware; therefore, a recommended value is not provided in this user’s guide.
An additional feature allowed in Solution 101 is the solution of a problem under uniform acceleration.  This
problem is posed using the DMIG,UACCEL , entry in addition to the previously mentioned requirements.  In this
case, uniform accelerations are applied to the model, and the solution is found.  Uniform accelerations are
useful for situations, such as spacecraft liftoff and landing loadings, which are often specified as static
accelerations.
As an example of inertia relief, consider the three CBEAM model shown in Figure 11-1.
Figure 11-1  Inertia Relief Analysis of a CBEAM Model
The three CBEAM structure is to be analyzed as a free-free structure with a line load acting in the Y-direction
as shown and using inertia relief.  To show the effect of the SUPORT point, two runs are made, each with a
different SUPORT grid point. Part of the input file is given in Listing 11-1.  Note that the SUPORT
information is shown for both runs; however, one set is commented out.  For the first run, (See
MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/inertia1.dat), the SUPORT point is located at grid point 1.  All six degrees of
freedoms for the SUPORT point are placed on one grid point as required for Solution 101.  The parameter
INREL is set to -1, and the parameter GRDPNT is set to the SUPORT point, which is grid point 1 in this
case.

Figure 11-2Inertia Relief Output When Grid Point 1 is the SUPORT Point (continued)
The GPWG (Grid Point Weight Generator) output is calculated with respect to the grid point specified on
the parameter GRDPNT .  The total mass of the structure in this model is 0.229, which is used by MSC
Nastran to develop the inertia loads.  Inspection of the GPWG output should be part of your routine model
checkout.
The OLOAD RESULTANT  contains seven sections&amp;ndash;consisting of seven lines per section. The first section
is the resultant of the applied loads about the GRDPNT, which is the basic coordinate system in this case.&lt;br&gt;
The remaining six sections are the inertial reaction forces and moments created by imposing unit
acceleration(s) about the SUPORT point.  Subcase 2 corresponds to the X-direction; Subcase 3 corresponds
to Y-direction, etc. The first six lines of each section represent the detailed contributions, whereas the seventh
line represents the total.
Following the OLOAD  output is User Information Message 3035 showing the strain energy and epsilon due
to the imposed unit accelerations about the SUPORT point.  As discussed earlier, the epsilons and strain
energies should be small, which is the case for this example.  Small epsilons and strain energy tell you that
you do not have any unwanted constraints or poorly defined MPCs causing a constraint in your model.&lt;br&gt;
Always inspect User Information Message 3035 to make sure that the epsilons and strain energies are small.
The intermediate matrix QRR is printed following the UIM 3035.  The QRR matrix is the total rigid body
mass of the total structure.  It is a 6 x 6 matrix measured about the PARAM,GRDPNT point in the global
coordinate system.  Masses on the scalar points are not included.  Following the QRR matrix is the QRL 0 *** USER INFORMATION MESSAGE 5293 (SSG3A)

matrix.  The QRL matrix is the resultant of the “apparent reaction loads,” measured at the SUPORT point.&lt;br&gt;
This resultant is equal and opposite to the OLOAD resultant shown earlier in the output, if the SUPORT
point is the same as the PARAM,GRDPNT point.  There is one column for each loading condition.  The
last matrix output is the URA matrix, which is the rigid body acceleration matrix that is computed from the
applied loads.
The displacement and stress output shown is the standard output as requested through the Case Control
Section.  Note that the displacement at the SUPORT point is exactly 0.0.  This SUPORT point should be
0.0 since this point is constrained for the solution, and the forces of constraint should be numeric zero.  The
SPC forces are shown in the output to confirm that the loads are balanced at the SUPORT point.  The
displacement of all of the other points in the model are relative to the SUPORT point.
An interesting effect occurs when the SUPORT point is changed in the previous example.  Suppose you
change the location of the SUPORT point from 1 to 3 (see the commented SUPORT entries in Figure 11-1).
(See MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/inertia2.dat) Some of intermediate output varies slightly, but the
interesting area is in the resulting displacement and stress output as shown in Figure 11-4.
Figure 11-3  Inertia Relief Output When Grid Point 3 Is the SUPORT Point
As can be seen, the displacement vector changes as the displacements are now relative to grid point 3, which
is the new SUPORT point.  However, the stresses in the elements are the same because the stresses are based
on the relative displacement between the grid points, which is independent of the grid point used for the
SUPORT point.
A final comment on this simple beam model:  suppose you used CBAR elements instead of CBEAM
elements for this model. The run would fail because the CBAR element does not have any torsional inertia
mass, whereas the CBEAM element does.  This model is basically a one-dimensional structure so that the
rotational inertia about the X-axis is the mass inertia of the elements.  When the inertia relief method is used,
the structure must have mass in all six directions.  In general, however, there are no restrictions on using a
CBAR element with inertia relief.  Most structures include CBARs that are not colinear.  The example above
was introduced merely to emphasize the need to have mass in all six degrees of freedom.
Suppose you wish to impose a 10 g acceleration at grid point 2 of the beam structure shown in Figure 11-1.&lt;br&gt;
This acceleration can be applied using the DMIG,UACCEL Bulk Data entry as shown:

The acceleration of 10 g is entered on the DMIG,UACCEL  entry.  When a DMIG (Direct Matrix Input)
entry is used, UACCEL, the first entry is the header entry, which is denoted by the 0 in field 3.  Field 4 must
be a 9, and field 5 is either a 1 for single precision input (the most common) or a 2 for double precision input.&lt;br&gt;
For this example, the input is in single precision.
The second entry is where the applied acceleration is entered.  Field 3 must be a 1, indicating that this is the
first load case (and the only load case in this model).  The grid point component and value of the enforced
acceleration are entered in fields 6, 7, and 8.  If acceleration is be to enforced in more than one component,
then the continuation entries are used.  For this example, the acceleration of 3864. in/sec2 is entered in field
8.  The 3864.0 is 10 g in the English system-you must ensure that the units are consistent.
When using the DMIG,UACCEL, the intermediate matrix URACCEL  is output as shown in Figure 11-4.&lt;br&gt;
This matrix is the rigid body acceleration that you input using the DMIG,UACCEL entry.  Also shown is
the OLOAD output and the displacement vector.  As can be seen, the SUPORT point is constrained, which
is what you would expect, and the total load applied to the structure corresponds to the mass of the structure
(see the GPWG output in Figure 11-4) times the enforced acceleration.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Although not commonly done, you can perform multiple inertia relief analyses in a single run.  This feature
can be activated with the SUPORT1 entries instead of the SUPORT entry.  Unlike the SUPORT entry,
which is automatically activated, the SUPORT1 entry must be selected by the SUPORT1 Case Control
command in order for it to be applied.

The &amp;ldquo;steady-state&amp;rdquo; relative structural displacements and internal loads are currently calculated using
SUPORTi Bulk Data entries and PARAM,INREL,-1 or automatically-without the need for SUPORTi
entries-and PARAM,INREL,-2. INREL=-1 allows for only six or less degrees-of-freedom on the SUPORTi
entries. INREL=-2 does not require SUPORTi entries but does require that the structure contain six and only
six rigid body modes.

Inertia Relief Using PARAM,INREL,-4468
Main Index
Starting in V2021.2, INREL=-4 extends INREL=-1 by allowing an unlimited number of degrees-of-freedom
on the SUPORTi entries. This method is also capable of handling mechanisms and problems that have
possible rigid body motion in selected directions. This method also requires reduction of the mass matrix.
User Interface
Specify PARAM,INREL,-4 in the Bulk Data or Case Control section and as many SUPORTi Bulk Data
entries that are needed to define the supported degrees-of-freedom.
Technical Discussion
When a free body is subjected to loads that are not in equilibrium, the body is accelerated in its rigid body
(or more generally, free body) modes. If the time rate of change of the applied loads is small compared to the
frequency of the lowest elastic mode of the system, an approximate state of equilibrium exists between the
applied loads and the inertia forces due to acceleration. Stresses in the body may be computed, in this case,
from an applied load distribution that includes the inertia forces. The term “inertia relief” is applied to the
effect that the inertia forces have on the structural stresses. For an “effect” to be defined, a condition in which
the effect does not exist must be imagined. In the case of inertia relief, the “effect-free” condition is one in
which the free body is restrained by determinate supports. The choice of support points is arbitrary, but
usually corresponds to a natural or customary location (e.g., the intersection between the wing and fuselage
of an aircraft). Although the condition including inertia effects is the correct solution, the analyst may also
be interested in the results for the supported condition.
The general procedure for including inertia relief in static analysis is as follows:
1.Select, from the displacement vector , a subset of determinate support points such that
the members of the set are just sufficient to eliminate the stress-free motions without introducing
redundant constraints.
2.Find the accelerations  due to the applied loads . This requires evaluation of the rigid
body mass matrix  referred to points .
3.Calculate accelerations at all other points  and the corresponding inertia forces.
4.Add the inertia force vector to the applied load vector and solve for the displacements  while
the structure is rigidly restrained at points . The forces of reaction will be zero.
The equations of motion for the body, expressed in terms of the accelerations, , can be written

Guidelines and Limitations
INREL=-4 is not supported with the following features:
•Design sensitivity and optimization analysis (SOL 200)
•Nonlinear analysis (SOL 400)
•DMIG,UACCEL Bulk Data entry
•CASI iterative solver
Inertia Relief Using PARAM,INREL,-2 (no Suport)
Inertia relief using param,inrel-2, we will call the Automatic Inertia Relief Method, is the recommended
inertia relief method. The SUPORT entry is no longer needed.  Only PARAM, INREL ,-2 is needed in the input
file. The method is designed for 3D models with exactly 6 rigid body modes. The reference frame is selected
automatically, in a manner that poor solutions are unlikely because of the choice of reference frame variables.&lt;br&gt;
The following features are not supported for the Automatic Inertia Relief Method:
The DMIG,UACCEL option
The Iterative Solver
As an example we will use the CBEAM model in Figure 11-1 using the automatic inertia relief method.  This
is accomplished by removing the SUPORT entry and replacing PARAM,INREL,-1 with PARAM,INREL,-

Introduction to Matrix Operations
When creating a model in MSC Nastran, equations are written to simulate the necessary structural
properties.  These equations are rows and columns  in the matrix  equations that describe the structural
behavior.  Six equations are created per grid point; one equation is created per scalar point (SPOINT ).  The
model definition (elements, properties, loads, etc.) is used to generate appropriate row and column entries in
the matrices (e.g., stiffness coefficients).  Certain data entries (i.e., SPCs, MPCs, ASETs, etc.) cause matrix
operations to be performed in the various stages of the solution process.  To organize the matrix operations ,
MSC Nastran assigns each degree of freedom (DOF) to a displacement set.
Most matrix operations used in a structural analysis involve addition, multiplication, decomposition,
forward/backward substitution, partitioning, merging, appending, and/or transforming matrix arrays from
one subset to another.  All components of motion of a given type form a vector set that is distinguished from
other vector sets.  A given component of motion can belong to many combined sets but can belong to only
one exclusive set.
A thorough understanding of matrix operations in MSC Nastran is not necessary to perform static analysis;
however, some knowledge of it gives you a better appreciation of the solution process that MSC Nastran
undergoes.
The following matrix operations are covered in this chapter:
Set definition
Static condensation
Direct matrix input
Set Definition
In MSC Nastran, there are two basic types of sets:
Combined sets
Mutually exclusive sets
Combined sets are formed through the union (combination) of two or more sets.  Mutually exclusive sets are
important in the solution process because if a DOF is a member of a mutually exclusive set, it cannot be a
member of any other mutually exclusive set.  The importance of this rule is demonstrated as the sets are
described in the rest of this chapter.
The Global Displacement Set
The degrees of freedom of the finite element model include all of the components of displacement at the grid
points and scalar points.  The DOFs for the grid points are expressed in the local coordinate systems
identified in field 7 of the GRID entry.  The union of all of the local displacement components at all of the
grid points and scalar points is called the global displacement set or g-set.  The g-set is the top level set.
The g-set displacement is represented as either  or .  Its significance is that the mathematical
expression for the static equilibrium  of the finite element model can be expressed in matrix form asugug&lt;/p&gt;

where  is the global stiffness matrix and  is the vector of explicit loads (e.g., loads generated
from FORCE entries) or implicit loads (e.g., loads generated from GRAV entries) applied to all of the grid
points and scalar points.
The stiffness matrix  is formed by generating and assembling the stiffness  matrices for all of the
elements.  The load vector  is formed by assembling all of the implicitly and explicitly defined load
components within a given loading condition.  Loads defined within elements are automatically transferred
to the appropriate grid points in a consistent  manner.
The number of terms in the  and  vectors is equal to six times the number of grid points plus
the number of scalar points.  is a real and symmetric matrix.
Subsets of the Global Displacement Set
The g-set represents an unconstrained set of structural equations.  is usually singular; therefore, the
equations of equilibrium cannot be solved in the form shown by Equation (12-1).
The next step in the solution process is to partition the g-set into two subsets-the m-set and the n-set.  The
dependent DOFs of all multipoint constraint  relations (MPCs, RBEs, etc.) define the m-set .  During the
solution process, the contributions of these m-set DOFs are condensed into the set of independent DOFs,
the n-set.  The n-set represents all of the independent DOFs that remain after the dependent DOFs are
removed from the active set of equations.  The m-set represents the DOFs that are linearly dependent upon
the n-set DOFs.
Using the n-set, SPCs are then applied to the independent equations to further partition the equations.&lt;br&gt;
Degrees of freedom identified by PARAM,AUTOSPC  and/or SPCi entries are assigned to the sb -set.  See
Constraints , 233 for more details regarding PARAM,AUTOSPC.  Permanent constraints, those DOFs
specified in field 8 of the GRID entry, are assigned to the sg -set.  The union of the sb- and sg-sets compose
the s-set.  After reducing the n-set by applying the s-set constraints, the f-set remains.  The f-set represents the
“free” DOFs of the structure.  If applied constraints are properly specified, then the f-set equations represent
a statically stable solution (i.e, a nonsingular stiffness matrix).
The f-set can be further reduced by partitioning it into the o- and a-set.  This operation is known as static
condensation  (Guyan reduction ) and is discussed in detail in Static Condensation (Guyan Reduction) , 472.  By
default, all DOFs in the f-set are assigned to the a-set in other words, the o-set is null, by default.
In the case where you want to analyze an unsupported structure (such as an aircraft in flight), you can put
some of the a-set degrees of freedom into a special set&amp;ndash;the reference set or r-set&amp;ndash;that is used to aid in the
calculation of inertia forces and to balance the applied loads.  The SUPORT Bulk Data entry is used for this
purpose.  In this case, the remaining degrees of freedom in the a-set are placed into the l-set.  The use of the
SUPORT entry for the automatic calculation of inertia loads in static analysis is described in Inertia Relief , 455.Kggug Pg =

&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Linear Statics Analysis User’s Guide
Set Definition470
Main Index
In order for the SUPORT entry to work, the finite element model must have a mass matrix.  The SUPORT&lt;br&gt;
entry must be specified for all six DOFs on a single grid point.  (Note that the word “SUPORT” is spelled
with one “P”.)
Another important use of the SUPORT entry is to provide a reference point in the computation of rigid body
modes  in dynamic analysis (see the  MSC Nastran Dynamic Analysis User’s Guide ).  Table 12-1 illustrates the basic
partitioning operations.  It is a representation of the basic sets, set partitions, and set combinations used in
MSC Nastran static analysis.
In the above table, the m-, s-, o-, and r-sets form the mutually exclusive sets.  Physically, the mutually exclusive
set partitioning ensures that operations cannot be performed on a DOF that is no longer active.  For example,
if you apply an SPC to a DOF that is a dependent degree of freedom on an RBAR , a User Fatal Message
(UFM) 2101A is issued.  Using an SPC  entry moves a DOF to the sb-set, but this cannot occur if the same
DOF is already a member of the m-set.  Both the m-set and sb-set are mutually exclusive.  Table 12-2 represents
the commonly used mutually exclusive sets in MSC Nastran.  Table 12-3 and Figure 12-1 represent the
combined sets used in MSC Nastran.
&lt;strong&gt;Strictly speaking, sb and sg are not exclusive with respect to one another.  Degrees of freedom may exist in
both sets simultaneously.  These sets are exclusive, however, from the other mutually exclusive sets.
&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The  l-set is not truly a mutually exclusive set; although it is conceptually viewed as a mutually exclusive set Table 12-1  Basic Set

When a particular set above has no DOFs associated with it, it is a null set.  If this set exists, a partition is
then applied, and the DOFs are moved to the subsequent partition.  Table 12-4 provides a list of possible Bulk
Data entries, which generate a corresponding subset.Table 12-3  Combined Sets in MSC Nastran (+ Indicates the Union of Two Sets)

*The PARAM,AUTOSPC,YES Bulk Data entry enables MSC Nastran to change the membership of a degree
of freedom in the f-set to membership in the s-set, based on the criteria described in Constraints .
The final set of degrees of freedom remaining after the above exclusive sets are eliminated is called the l-set&lt;br&gt;
(degrees of freedom left over).  The static solution is performed on the  set.  The reduced equations of
equilibrium are expressed in the matrix form
(12-2)
The reduced stiffness matrix  is symmetric and is also nonsingular if all mechanisms and rigid body
motion are removed by the partitioning of the m-set , s-set, and r-set. Equation (12-2) is solved for  by
Gaussian elimination (decomposition and forward-backward substitution).  All of the other subsets of&lt;br&gt;
vector&amp;ndash;namely , , , and &amp;ndash;can be obtained subsequently by successive substitution into their
defining equations.  By default, all f-set degrees of freedom are assigned to the a-set.  If you do not have a
rigid body support ( r-set) in your model, then the a-set is identical to your l-set.
The set membership of all of the degrees of freedom can be output by means of the PARAM, USETPRT ,x Bulk
Data entry.  This entry should be used with caution since a large model may produce a substantial amount
of output using this parameter.  See the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide  for a complete description of all the
options available for PARAM,USETPRT,x. The above discussed, the basic sets in MSC Nastran, for a
complete definition of all sets see the Degree-of-Freedom Set Definitions  in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference
Guide . Constraint and Set Notation  in the MSC Nastran Reference Guide  has a more complete description of how
the sets are generated.
Static Condensation (Guyan Reduction)
The terms static condensation  and Guyan reduction  represent the same matrix operations and are used
interchangeably.  Guyan Reduction involves a reformulation of the stiffness and mass matrices based on
partitions of the stiffness matrix.  If you start with the stiffness equation in terms of the set of the
unconstrained (free) structural coordinates, you haveTable 12-4  Subsets Versus Bulk Data Entries

Static Condensation (Guyan Reduction)474
Main Index
In static analysis, the results using static condensation are numerically exact.  The partitioned solution merely
changes the order of the operations of the unpartitioned solution.  Guyan reduction is, however, not generally
recommended for static analysis.  This recommendation stems from the cost of the Guyan reduction process
since it creates reduced matrices   and , which are typically smaller but denser (i.e., matrix
bandwidth is destroyed).  Additional decomposition of the matrix  is also required.  In other words,
even though the solution size is smaller, the solution time may take longer and the disk space requirement
may be larger due to a denser matrix.  Furthermore, it requires additional interaction on your part.  However,
some understanding of the concept of Guyan reduction in static analysis is quite helpful if you ever decide to
apply this feature in dynamic, cyclic symmetry, or superelement analyses.
Guyan reduction has special applications in dynamic analysis.  In dynamic analysis, the reduction is
approximate; the term  is ignored in this case.  The reduction is based solely on static transformation
and is exact provided that no loads are applied to the o-set degrees of freedom.
User Interface (ASET, OMIT)
To utilize static condensation, you can choose either the ASET/ASET1  or the OMIT/OMIT1  entries.  With
these entries you should specify only the a-set (with ASET/ASET1 entries) or o-set (with OMIT/OMIT1
entries) degrees of freedom.  The unspecified remaining f-set DOFs are automatically placed in the
complementary set.  However, if you specify both the a-set and o-set DOFs, then the unspecified remaining
f-set DOFs are automatically placed in the o-set.  The same DOF cannot be specified on both the a-set and
o-set; otherwise, the job fails with UFM 2101A.
Since the reduction process is performed on an individual degree of freedom, it is possible to have some of
the degrees of freedom at a grid point in the a-set and other degrees of freedom at a grid point in one of the
other mutually exclusive sets.  No additional user input is required.
ASET can be used in conjunction with ASET1 .  The formats for the ASET/ASET1 are as follows:

The choice of whether to use the ASET/ASET1 or OMIT/OMIT1 is really a matter of convenience.
Consider a simple example using Guyan reduction.  The cantilever beam model in Figure 12-2 is used for this
purpose.  The common Bulk Data entries for this model are contained in Listing 12-1. (See

The first run is a conventional run without any reduction ( Listing 12-2).  (See
MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/full.dat) Since Guyan reduction  is not used, then, by default, all degrees of
freedom that are not otherwise constrained are assigned to the a-set.  In other words, degrees of freedom 1
through 6 for grid points 2 through 6 are assigned to the a-set.  Components 1 through 6 of grid point 1 are
assigned to the s-set due to the SPC Case Control command and SPC1 Bulk Data entry.

The second run uses Guyan reduction  by specifying degrees of freedom 1 through 6 at grid points 2, 4, and
6 to the a-set by using the ASET1  entries ( Listing 12-3).  (See MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/aset.dat) Due to
this action, the remaining unconstrained degrees of freedom (DOF 1 through 6 for grid points 3 and 5) are
assigned to the o-set.  Components 1 through 6 of grid point 1 are assigned to the s-set due to the SPC  Case
Control command and SPC1 Bulk Data entry.

The third run is similar to the second run except the omitted degrees of freedom are specified rather than the
analysis degrees of freedom ( Listing 12-4).  (See MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/omit.dat) Degrees of freedom
1 through 6 for grid points 3 and 5 are assigned to the o-set by using the OMIT1  entries.  Due to this action,
degrees of freedom 1 through 6 for grid points 2, 4, and 6 are automatically assigned to the a-set.&lt;br&gt;

Direct Matrix Input
The finite element approach simulates the structural properties with mathematical equations written in
matrix format.  Once you provide the grid point locations, element connectivities, cross-sectional properties,
material properties, applied loads, and boundary conditions, MSC Nastran then automatically generates the
appropriate structural matrices.  The structural behavior is then obtained by solving these equations.
If these structural matrices are available externally, you can input these matrices directly without providing
all the modeling information.  Normally this is not a recommended procedure since it requires additional
effort on your part.  However, there are occasions where the availability of this feature is very useful and in
some cases is extremely crucial.  Some possible applications are listed below: ***** PARTIAL OUTPUT FROM MODEL WITHOUT USING GUYAN REDUCTION *****&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;481 CHAPTER 12
Matrix Operations
Main Index
1.Suppose you are a subcontractor to a classified project.  The substructure that you are analyzing is
attached to the main structure built by the primary contractor.  The flexibility of this main structure
is crucial to the response of your component, but the geometry of the main structure is classified.  The
main contractor, however, can provide you with the stiffness matrix of the classified structure.  By
reading in this stiffness matrix and adding it to your MSC Nastran model, you can account for the
flexibility  of the attached structure without compromising the security.  The stiffness  matrix is the
inverse of the flexibility matrix. Also by providing the mass matrix as well, then dynamic analysis can
also be preformed.
2.Suppose you are investigating a series of design options on a component attached to an aircraft
bulkhead.  Your component consists of 500 DOFs and the aircraft model consists of 100,000 DOFs.&lt;br&gt;
The flexibility of the backup structure is somewhat important.  You can certainly analyze your
component by including the full aircraft model (100,500 DOFs).  On the other hand, if the
flexibility at the attachment points on the aircraft can be measured experimentally, then you can add
the experimental backup structure stiffness to your component without including the whole aircraft
model.  The experimental backup structure  stiffness matrix is the inverse of the measured flexibility
matrix.  This way your model size remains at 500 DOFs, and you still have a good approximation of
the backup structure stiffness. You can also as an approximation, reduce the matrices for the entire
aircraft down to a manageable size using dynamic reduction (see Static Condensation (Guyan Reduction)&lt;br&gt;
and Dynamic Reduction ).  These reduced mass and stiffness matrices can then be read and added to your
various component models.  In this case, you may be analyzing a 2000 -DOF system, instead of a
100,500 -DOF system.
3.The same concept can be applied to a component attached to a test fixture.  The stiffness and mass
of the fixture at the attachment locations can be read in as a stiffness and mass matrices. Furthermore,
there are times whereby the flexibility of the test fixture at the attachment points can be measured
experimentally. In this instance, this experimental stiffness matrix can be input to your model. Once
again, the experimental test fixture stiffness matrix at the attachment points is the inverse of the
measured flexibility at these points.
The above are just a few of the many possible applications.  You can probably think of other usages.  There
are several ways that these matrices can be read in; some of these are DMIG , GENEL , and INPUTT4.  Only
DMIG is covered in this section.  GENEL is covered in detail in MSC Nastran Elements .  The DMIG and the
INPUTT4 options offer alternate methods for inputting large matrices.  Note that INPUTT4 provides more
precision than the DMIG input; the DMIG yields more precision than the GENEL on a shortword
machine.  See the MSC Nastran DMAP Programmer’s Guide  for more details on INPUTT4.
DMIG
The DMIG  feature can be used to directly input a stiffness , mass , or loading  matrix to the grid and/or scalar

must also be symmetric.  These matrices are implemented on the g-set level.  In other words, these terms are
added to the finite element model at the specified DOFs  prior to the application of constraints.  This section
only includes features of the DMIG that are used in static analysis.  The DMIG has additional features that
can be used in dynamic analysis, but they are not discussed in this user’s guide.
DMIG Bulk Data User Interface
In the Bulk Data Section , the DMIG matrix is defined by a single DMIG header entry followed by a series of
DMIG Bulk Data entries.  Each of these DMIG data entries contains a column containing the nonzero
elements for the particular matrix that you are entering.
DMIG
Header Entry Format:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
DMIG NAME “0&amp;quot; IFO TIN TOUT POLAR NCOL
Field Contents
NAME Name of the matrix.  It consists of one to eight alphanumeric characters, the first of which
must be alphabetic.  (Required)
IFO Form of matrix input:  Integer, required
1 = square
9 or 2 = rectangle
6 = symmetric
TIN Type of matrix being input:
1 = Real, single precision (one field is used per element)
2 = Real, double precision (one field per element)
3 = Complex, single precision (two fields are used per element)
4 = Complex, double precision (two fields per element)
TOUT Type of matrix to be created:
0 = Set by precision system cell (default)
1 = Real, single precision
2 = Real, double precision
3 = Complex, single precision
4 = Complex, double precisionKgg2 and Mgg2&lt;/p&gt;

Remarks:
1.One header entry is required for each input matrix.
2.The matrix name used in field 2 must be unique.
3.Field 3 of the header entry must contain an integer 0.
4.The default value of 0 for TOUT is recommended.
5.If the input matrix is rectangular, the use of IFO = 9 is recommended instead of IFO =2.
Column Data Entry Format
Remarks:
1.Each non-null column (a column with at least one nonzero term) starts with a GJ, CJ pair.  The
entries (Gi, Ci pairs) for each row of that column follow.  The number of Gi, Ci pairs equals the
number of nonzero terms in that column.  The terms may be input in arbitrary order.  High precision
is required when using DMIG; therefore, in general, the use of large field input is recommended.&lt;br&gt;
Each nonnull column of your matrix makes up a DMIG column data entry.  Therefore, the total
number of DMIG entries is equal to the number of nonnull columns plus one.  The extra entry is
the DMIG header entry.POLAR Input format of Ai, Bi. (Integer = blank or 0 indicates real, imaginary format; integer &amp;gt; 0
indicates amplitude, phase format.)
NCOL Number of columns in a rectangular matrix.  Used only for IFO =9. (Integer &amp;gt; 0).
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
DMIG NAME GJ CJ G1 C1 A1 B1
G2 C2 A2 B2 -etc.-
Field Contents
NAME This is the same name that is used with its corresponding header entry as described above.
GJ The external grid or scalar point identification number for the column. (Integer &amp;gt; 0).
CJ The component number for the GJ grid point.  (0 &amp;lt; Integer &amp;lt; 6 if GJ is a grid point; blank
or zero if GJ is a scalar point).
Gi The external grid or scalar point identification number for the row.  (Integer &amp;gt; 0).
Ci The component number for the Gi grid point.  (0 &amp;lt; Integer &amp;lt; 6 if Gi is a grid point; blank
or zero if Gi is a scalar point).
Ai, Bi Real and imaginary (or amplitude and phase) parts of a matrix element.  If the matrix is real
(TIN = 1 or 2), then Bi must be blank.Field Contents&lt;/p&gt;

2.For symmetric matrices  (IFO = 6), a given off-diagonal term may be input either below or above the
diagonal.  While the upper and lower triangle terms may be mixed, a fatal error results if the
corresponding symmetric element is input both below and above the diagonal.  However, to keep it
simple for yourself, it is recommended that for a given matrix, you should decide to input the terms
either completely below the diagonal or above the diagonal, but not both.  The symmetric option is
generally used for the mass and stiffness matrices.
3.Rectangular matrices  can be input using the option IFO = 9.  This option is generally used to input
load matrices.
Example:
DMIG Case Control User Interface
In order to include these matrices, the Case Control Section  must contain the appropriate commands; K2GG
(Case)  in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide , M2GG , or P2G .
See the Example and Remarks in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide  for inputting and addition of multiple
matrices on the same K2GG, M2GG, etc. selections. Discussions in this guide will only reference one matrix
at a time.
Examples
K2GG = mystif
The above Case Control command adds the terms of the matrix, which are defined by the DMIG entries
with a name of “mystif”, to the g-set stiffness matrix.
M2GG = yourmass
The above Case Control command adds the terms of the matrix, which are defined by the DMIG entries
with a name of “yourmass”, to the g-set mass matrix.
P2G = hisload
The above Case Control command adds the terms of the matrix, which are defined by the DMIG entries
with a name of “hisload”, to the g-set load matrix.
B2GG=ourdamp
The above Case Control command adds terms that are defined by the DMIG Bulk Data entries with the
name “ourdamp” to the g -set damping matrix.
DMIG Examples
Consider a few examples using the DMIG features.  The cantilever beam model shown in Figure 12-4 is used
for this purpose.DMIG STIF 0 6 1

ENDDATA
The next run removes CBAR element number 5 from the input file and uses the DMIG feature to directly
read in the bar element stiffness matrix.  The bar element stiffness matrix for a planar element and ignoring
the axial stiffness is as follows:
Since the matrix is symmetric, either the lower or upper triangular portion of the matrix must therefore be
provided.  For , , and , the stiffness matrix for
CBAR element number 5 is as follows:
(12-8)
In this case, you chose UGSTIF as the name of the input stiffness for bar element number 5.  Therefore, in
order to bring in this stiffness matrix and add it to the global stiffness matrix, the Case Control command
K2GG  = UGSTIF is required.  Note these stiffness terms are additions to the global stiffness matrix at that
location and are not a replacement of the stiffness terms at that location.  In the Bulk Data Section, five
DMIG entries are required-one for the header entry and four for the data column entries&amp;ndash;since there are four
non-null columns in the above matrix.Ke2EI

For the header entry, the same name UGSTIF must be used to match the name called out in the Case Control
Section.  The third field is 0, which must be the value used for the header entry.  The fourth field (IFO) is
set to 6 to denote a symmetric matrix input.  The fifth field (TIN) is set to 1 to denote that the matrix is
provided as real, single precision.
Once again, the terms in the matrix are referenced in terms of their external grid IDs when using the DMIG&lt;br&gt;
feature.  Physically, each term in a particular column of the stiffness matrix  represents the induced
reactive load in the i-th degree of freedom due to a unit displacement in the j-th direction with all other
displacement degrees of freedom held to zero.  Since the matrix is symmetric, only the lower triangular
portion of the matrix is read.
The first DMIG data column entry reads the first column of the above matrix.  Field 2 of this DMIG entry
must have the same name UGSTIF as referenced by the Case Control K2GG = UGSTIF command.  Fields
3 and 4 of this entry identify this column in terms of its external grid ID and corresponding degree of
freedom, respectively.  In this case, it is grid point number 5, degree of freedom 3 (z-translation at grid
number 5).
Once this column is defined and by following the format description as described in the section for column
data entry format, you can then input the four terms in this column  row by row .  These four terms are
defined by sets of three fields.  They are the external grid point ID number, corresponding degree of freedom,
and the actual matrix term, respectively.  The first row of column one is defined by external grid point ID 5,
degree of freedom 3 (z-translation at grid point number 5) with a stiffness value of 500039.  The second row
of column one is defined by external grid point ID 5, degree of freedom 5 (y-rotation at grid point number
5) with a stiffness value of -250019.  The third row of column one is defined by external grid point ID 6,
degree of freedom 3 (z-translation at grid point number 6) with a stiffness value of -500039.  The fourth row
of column one is defined by external grid point ID 6, degree of freedom 5 (y-rotation at grid point number
6) with a stiffness value of -250019.
The next DMIG  entry reads the second column of the above matrix starting with the diagonal term.  Fields
3 and 4 of this entry identify this column in terms of its external grid point ID and corresponding degree of
freedom, respectively.  In this case, it is grid number 5, degree of freedom 5 (y-rotation at grid point number
5).  The rest of the procedure is similar to that of column one with the exception that only three rows need
to be read due to symmetry (rows two through four).
The next two DMIG entries read columns three and four of the stiffness matrix, respectively.  Note that due
to symmetry, one less row needs to be read for each additional column.&lt;br&gt;
A partial input file using DMIG is contained in Listing 12-6.  (See
MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/dmigstfs.dat) The results as compared with the conventional analysis are
tabulated in the first two sections of Figure 12-5.  The comparison is performed for Subcase 1 with a vertical
load applied to the tip of the cantilever beam.  In this case, the results are accurate to within three to four
digits.&lt;br&gt;
As mentioned previously, a high degree of precision should be retained when inputting a matrix with the
DMIG method.  In this case, since the small-field input format is used, the maximum number of characters
that can be used are eight (including sign and decimal place).  The same job was then rerun for the DMIG
input with additional significant digits added using double-precision and large-field format as shown in
partial listing ( Listing 12-7).  (See MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/dmigsifl.dat.) In this case, the results are kij&lt;/p&gt;

Figure 12-5  Results Comparison Between the Conventional Method Versus DMIG
Mass Matrix Using DMIG
So far the discussion has focused on reading a stiffness matrix using DMIG .  The mass matrix can be included
in a similar manner as the stiffness matrix with the following exceptions:
1.The command M2GG  = “name”, instead of K2GG  = “name”, is used in the Case Control Section.&lt;br&gt;
The “name” is the name of the mass matrix referenced in field two of the DMIG Bulk Data entries.
2.The matrix defined in the DMIG entries represents the mass matrix terms instead of the stiffness
matrix terms.
Load Matrix Using DMIG
The load vectors can also be read using the DMIG feature if desired, although this is not a commonly used
feature.  It is similar to the format for reading in the stiffness or mass matrix, with the following exceptions:
1.The command P2G  = “name”, instead of K2GG  = “name” or M2GG  = “name”, is used in the Case
Control Section .
2.The matrix defined in the DMIG entries are columns of the load vectors instead of the stiffness or
mass matrix terms.***** PARTIAL OUTPUT FROM DMIGFULL.F06 - FULL MODEL *****

3.The load matrix, in general, is rectangular and unsymmetric (i.e., IFO = 9 on the header entry).
4.The column number (GJ) specified on the DMIG input must match the load sequence number.  The
GJ field is the load sequence number, and the CJ field is not used at all for a rectangular matrix.  For
example, if there is a total of ten load conditions in your model and you want to add load vectors to
the third and seventh subcases using DMIG, then the NCOL field should be assigned as 10 on the
header entry.  Two additional DMIG Data entries, representing the two load vectors added to the
third and seventh subcases, are needed.  The GJ field for the first of these two data entries must have
a value of 3 to denote the third load sequence.  The remaining data for this entry are the nonzero rows
of this load vector.  Their input format is identical to that of the stiffness or mass matrix.  The GJ
field for the second of these two data entries must have a value of 7 to denote the seventh load
sequence number.  Again, the remaining data for this entry are the nonzero rows of this load vector.
Again the problem in Figure 12-4 is used to illustrate this feature.  The partial input file is shown in Listing 12-8.
(See MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/dmigload.dat) In this example, the DMIG feature is used to read in the
load for the vertical tip load in Subcase 10.  In the Case Control Section, the P2G = UGLOAD command is
used to activate the DMIG entries with the name of UGLOAD.  In the Bulk Data Section, the DMIG load
header entry is similar to that of the stiffness and mass header entry with the exception of the IFO and NCOL
fields.  In general, the matrix is rectangular; therefore, IFO is defined as 9 instead of 6.  NCOL is the total
number of load cases for the problem.
Since there are two load cases, NCOL must be defined as 2.  The number of DMIG load data entries is equal
to the number of external load columns added.  In this case, you only need one DMIG load data entry since
only one load condition is added to the first subcase.  The GJ field of 1 denotes that you are adding the load
to the first subcase (first load sequence).  Note that GJ references the load sequence (1) rather than the
SUBCASE ID (10).  The CJ field should be blank when using the DMIG load feature.  The rest of the fields
are read in the same manner as the stiffness and mass matrices&amp;ndash;only nonzero entries need to be defined.  Note
that if you have reversed your subcase setup&amp;ndash;that is, if you apply your gravity load as the first subcase and
bring in the tip load as the second subcase&amp;ndash;then field three of the second DMIG entry must then be modified
to 2 instead of 1.&lt;/p&gt;

Figure 12-6  Results Comparison Between Conventional Load Input Versus DMIG
As you may notice by now, inputting large matrices by hand using the DMIG  method can be time
consuming, error prone, and quite tedious. However, in most instances, the DMIG input may be
automatically generated by a DMAP module when using MSC Nastran or other external programs .
PARAM, EXTOUT ,DMIGPCH can also be used to generate these DMIG entries. See the MSC Nastran
Superelements and Modules User’s Guide  for a further description of this capability.***** PARTIAL OUTPUT FROM DMIGFULL.F06 - FULL MODEL *****&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction to Linear Buckling
In linear static analysis, a structure is normally considered to be in a state of stable equilibrium .  As the applied
load is removed, the structure is assumed to return to its original position.  However, under certain
combinations of loadings, the structure may become unstable.  When this loading is reached, the structure
continues to deflect without an increase in the magnitude of the loading.  In this case, the structure has
actually buckled or has become unstable; hence, the term “instability ” is often used interchangeably with the
term “buckling .”
Only linear buckling  or elastic stability  is considered in this user’s guide; in other words, assume there is no
yielding of the structure and the direction of the forces do not change (i.e., follower force effects are ignored).&lt;br&gt;
Other assumptions of elastic stability are discussed in Assumptions and Limitations of Linear Buckling Analysis , 503.
This chapter is organized into the following sections:
Finite element approach
Eigenvalue extraction method
Assumptions and limitations of linear buckling analysis
Examples
Finite Element Approach
In finite element analysis, the problem of linear buckling is addressed by including the effect of the differential
stiffness  to the linear stiffness  matrix.  The differential stiffness results from including the higher-order terms
of the strain-displacement relationships.  From a physical standpoint, the differential stiffness matrix
represents the linear approximation of softening (reducing) the linear stiffness matrix in the case of a
compressive axial load, and stiffening (increasing) the linear stiffness matrix in the case of a tensile axial load.&lt;br&gt;
Since the differential stiffness either adds or subtracts from the linear stiffness, often it is also called the
incremental stiffness.  The element linear and differential stiffness matrices are denoted as  and ,
respectively.
The differential stiffness matrix is a function of the geometry , element type, and applied loads.  A look at the
differential stiffness matrix of a single planar bar element as shown in Figure 13-1 shows how a linear buckling
analysis is handled using a finite element approach.  For clarity, only the y and degrees of freedom at each
end are retained for this example.

Linear Buckling
Main Index
From The Nastran Theoretical Manual , the differential stiffness for this planar  bar element can be represented
as
(13-1)
where  is the axial force in the CBAR element.  In this case,  (applied load) =  since there is only
one element in the model and the applied load is in line with the element axis.  In the general case,  is
proportional to as long as the structure remains linear; in other words, if  is increased by scale factor
,then  also increases by the same scale factor.  The value “i” stands for the i-th element.  Note also
that the differential stiffness  matrix is dependent only on the element type, the applied forces, and the
geometry  of the structure.  This is the reason why the differential stiffness is also often called the geometric
stiffness matrix. Equation (13-1) can, therefore, be rewritten as follows:
(13-2)
One can view  as the distribution factor of the applied load  to the i-th element.  Each element in the
structure that supports differential stiffness (see Assumptions and Limitations of Linear Buckling Analysis, 503 ) has an
element differential stiffness matrix associated with it.  Each of these differential stiffness matrices has a scale
factor  similar to Eq. (13-2).  In general, each  is different for each element in the structure.  The value of kdi6Fxi

each  depends on the element type, the orientation of the element relative to the overall structure, and the
applied load.
The system linear stiffness  matrix can then be represented as
Similarly, the system differential stiffness matrix can be represented as
In general, the individual  is more complicated than Equation (13-1); however, the concept is the same.&lt;br&gt;
The overall system stiffness matrix is represented by Equation (13-3).
(13-3)
The total potential energy is equal to
(13-4)
In order for the system to achieve static equilibrium , the total potential must have a stationary value; in other
words, the relationship in Equation (13-5) must be satisfied

It is convenient to rewrite Equation (13-5) as

obtainable for your finite element model is equal to the number of degrees of freedom of your model.  In
other words,
(13-8)
Equation (13-7) can, therefore, be rewritten as
(13-9)
Equation (13-9) is in the form of an eigenvalue problem.  Once you obtain the eigenvalues , the buckling
loads can then be obtained using Equation (13-8).  The values  are the scale factors by which the applied
load  is multiplied to produce the critical buckling loads
As you can see from Equation (13-8), the magnitude of the applied load  is arbitrary for arriving at the
correct
As an example, if  is increased by a factor of 10, then the calculated  values in Equation (13-9) are reduced
by a factor of 10; in other words, their resulting products
remain the same.
In general, only the lowest buckling load is of any practical interest.  The structure will fail prior to reaching
any of the higher buckling loads.
Solution 105
In MSC Nastran you can solve a linear buckling problem by using Solution 105 and following the procedure
listed below.
1.Apply the static  loads to the first n subcases (n is usually equal to one) and treat them as static analysis.&lt;br&gt;
The distribution of element forces due to these applied loads is generated internally.  The actual
magnitude of these applied loads is not critical.
2.You can perform buckling analysis on any or all of the loading conditions used in Step 1.  One
additional subcase is needed for each buckling analysis.
3.The n+1 to the n+m subcases must each request an eigenvalue  method from the Bulk Data Section
to solve the eigenvalue problem shown in Equation (13-9).  In this case, m is equal to the number of
buckling analyses that you want to perform.   Each buckling subcase may call out a unique eigenvalue
solution. PcriiPa =

4.The differential stiffness  matrix is automatically generated for each element that supports differential
stiffness.  See Assumptions and Limitations of Linear Buckling Analysis  for a list of elements that support
differential stiffness.
5.You must then multiply the eigenvalues obtained in Step 3 by the appropriate applied loads to obtain
the buckling loads Equation (13-8) for each buckling analysis.
6.Each subcase may have a different boundary condition.
A typical input file used to calculate the buckling loads is shown in Listing 13-1.  In most applications, only
one static and one buckling analysis is performed per run.  Example 6 in Examples , 504 contains an application
of multiple static and buckling analyses.

You should also adhere to the following guidelines when solving a linear buckling problem in MSC Nastran.
1.The Case Control Section  must contain at least two subcases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;499 CHAPTER 13
Linear Buckling
Main Index
2.A METHOD  command must appear in each buckling  subcase to select the appropriate eigenvalue
extraction method (EIGRL or EIGB entry) from the Bulk Data Section.  If there are two or more
buckling subcases, then a STATSUB = x command must be placed in each buckling subcase to select
the appropriate static subcase.  If there is only one buckling subcase, then the STATSUB = x
command is optional if x references the first static subcase ID.
3.A static loading condition must be defined with a LOAD, TEMP(LOAD) , or DEFORM  selection
unless all loading is specified by grid point displacements on SPC entries.  All static subcases must be
placed before the first buckling subcase.
4.Correct SPC  sets must be selected for all subcases.
5.Output requests that apply to only a particular subcase must be placed inside that subcase.
6.Output requests that apply to all subcases may be placed above the subcase level.
7.Some type of output request (e.g., disp(plot) = all) must be requested for at least one subcase.&lt;br&gt;
Examples  contains six example problems that illustrate some of these guidelines.
Eigenvalue Extraction Method
Seven methods of real eigenvalue extraction are available in MSC Nastran:
Givens
Modified Givens
Householder
Modified Householder
Inverse power
Enhanced inverse power
Lanczos
Three out of these seven methods can be used for linear bucklng analysis:
Inverse power
Enhanced inverse power
Lanczos
A brief description of each eigenvalue method is presented in the following sections.  For further details, see
the MSC Nastran Numerical Methods User’s Guide .
Inverse Power Method (INV)
The inverse power method is a tracking method  since it attempts to extract the lowest eigenvalue  and
eigenvector  in the desired range first.  Their effects are then “swept” out.  The next higher mode is then
found, and its effects are “swept” out, and so on&amp;ndash;hence, the term “tracking,” which means that one root at a
time is found.  Furthermore, each root is found via an iterative process.  (The classical literature often refers
to this method as the “inverse iteration  method with sweeping.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Linear Statics Analysis User’s Guide
Eigenvalue Extraction Method500
Main Index
Unfortunately, depending on your selection of the eigenvalue range, the inverse power method can miss
modes, which makes it unreliable.  For this reason, the inverse method is not recommended.  The enhanced
inverse power method is, in general, a more reliable tracking method.
Enhanced Inverse Power Method (SINV)
This method is similar to the inverse power method except that it uses Sturm sequence  logic to ensure that
all modes are found within the specified eigenvalue range.  The Sturm sequence informs you of the number
of modes below each trial eigenvalue.  See MSC Nastran Numerical Methods User’s Guide  and the MSC
Nastran Dynamic Analysis User’s Guide  for further details regarding the Sturm sequence check.
Lanczos Method
The Lanczos  method overcomes the limitations and combines the best features of the other methods.  It is
efficient, and if an eigenvalue cannot be extracted within the range that you specify, a diagnostic message is
issued.  This method computes accurate eigenvalues and eigenvectors.  Furthermore, it prints meaningful
user diagnostics and supports parallel processing computers.
Comparison of Methods
The best method for a particular model depends on four factors:
The size of the model (the total number of degrees of freedom)
The number of eigenvalues desired
The available real memory  on your computer
How well you can estimate  the range of your eigenvalues
The enhanced inverse power method (SINV) can be a good choice if the model is too large to fit into
memory, only a few modes are needed, and you have a reasonable idea of your eigenvalue range of interest.&lt;br&gt;
It is useful for models in which only the lowest few modes are desired.  This method is also useful as a backup
method to verify the accuracy of other methods.
For medium to large models, the Lanczos method is the recommended method.  Furthermore, the Lanczos
method takes full advantage of sparse matrix methods that can substantially increase computational speed and
reduce disk space usage.  For overall robustness, the Lanczos method is the recommended method.
User Interface
A METHOD  (Case)  command is required in a subcase of the Case Control Section to select the appropriate
eigenvalue extraction method in the Bulk Data Section .  The Bulk Data entry  is different depending on
whether you are using the inverse power (INV), enhanced inverse power (SINV ), or Lanczos method.  The
EIGRL  entry is used for the Lanczos method, and the EIGB  entry is used for the INV and SINV  methods.
The EIGRL  entry has the following format:&lt;/p&gt;

The SID field is the set identification number, which is referenced by the METHOD  command in the Case

Nastran takes depending on the values specified for V1, V2, and ND.

MSC Nastran Linear Buckling with Local Exclusion of
Differential Stiffness
Introduction
In this release a new parameter, PARAM, EXCLUDE, n, has been added to allow the user to select sets of
GRID points for which differential stiffness in SOL105 will be ignored for n positive or retained if n is
negative.
Benefits
Allows users to remove zones from linear buckling analysis where buckling is known to be of no interest.
Parameter
EXCLUDE
Default = 0
PARAM, EXCLUDE, Integer. Add PARAM, EXCLUDE, n in the buckling subcase(s) to activate linear
buckling with local exclusion of differential stiffness. If n is positive, it selects the SET1 entry ID in the bulk
data that defines the list of GRID points for which differential stiffness will be ignored. If n is negative, the
absolute value selects the SET1 entry ID in the bulk data that defines the list of GRID points for which
differential stiffness will be retained.
Care must be exercised by the user to select GRID points that follow natural mesh lines as much as possible,
otherwise an element may be connected to some GRID points that have differential stiffness and some GRID 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

excluded differential stiffness should not be in, or close to, a region of interest. Selecting stiff (unlikely to

Assumptions and Limitations of Linear Buckling Analysis
The following assumptions and limitations apply to linear buckling analysis:
1.The deflections must be small.
2.The element stresses must be elastic .
3.The differential stiffness  is supported for the following elements:  CONROD , CROD , CTUBE ,
CBAR , CBEAM , CBEAM3, CBEND, CQUAD4 , CQQUADR, CQUAD8 , CTRIA3 , CTRIAR,
CTRIA6 , CSHEAR, CHEXA , CPENTA , and CTETRA .
4.A minimum of five grid points per half sine wave  (buckled shape) is recommended.
5.The distribution of the internal element forces due to the applied loads remains constant.
6.For 3-D buckling problems, the use of PARAM,K6ROT  is recommended for CQUAD4 and
CTRIA3 elements.  A value of 100 is the default.
7.For structures that exhibit nonlinear material  or large deflection deformations, the linear buckling
load obtained from Solution 105  may be different than the actual buckling load.  For structures with
significant nonlinearities, it is recommended that you perform a nonlinear buckling analysis using
Solution 106  or use full nonlinear analysis with SOL 400 . The discussion of nonlinear analysis is
beyond the scope of this user’s guide. See Reference 16. for further details regarding nonlinear
buckling analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

Examples
This section contains six example problems pertaining to buckling.  Each problem is chosen to illustrate
either a particular type of failure mode, the effect of an element type, the effect of a structural configuration,
or the method of performing multiple buckling analyses in a single run.  The examples are as follows:
1.Classical Euler beam buckling.
2.Lateral buckling.
3.Planar frame buckling.
4.Buckling of a stiffened panel with transverse shear flexibility.
5.Buckling of a cylinder under uniform axial load.
6.Multiple buckling analyses in a single run.
In each example, the results produced by MSC Nastran are compared with known theoretical solutions.
Example 1 &amp;ndash; Classical Euler Beam Buckling
Consider a classical Euler buckling problem.  This problem is shown in Figure 13-2.

The input file used for this problem is shown in Listing 13-2.  In this case, a 1000 N compressive load  is
applied at the roller end to generate internal loads for the structure.  The Lanczos  eigenvalue  extraction
method is used to request the first five modes.  Either the CBAR or CBEAM  elements can be chosen for this
problem; the CBAR  elements are used in this case.

A comparison between MSC Nastran results and the theoretical results is summarized in Table 13-2.
As you approach the higher modes, the mode shapes become less smooth.  This effect occurs because for the
same mesh density, the higher modes have fewer grid points per buckled sine wave than the lower modes.  If
you are interested in these mode shapes, you should increase your model mesh density to follow the general
guideline of maintaining a minimum of five grid points per half sine wave.  However, these higher failure
modes are seldom of interest in real-life applications.
Example 2 &amp;ndash; Lateral Buckling
The problem shown in Figure 13-4 illustrates an interesting case of lateral buckling .  The model consists of a
cantilever beam with a vertical tip load applied at the free end.  The dimensions of the beam are identical to
Example 1.  In this example, the structure buckles in the lateral direction (xz plane) perpendicular to the
applied load rather than in the plane of the applied load (xy plane).

Results for Example 2
Listing 13-5 contains the corresponding model for this lateral buckling  problem.  (See
MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/bucklat.dat) The CBEAM  element is used in this case, although the CBAR&lt;br&gt;
element can also be used since this beam consists of a constant cross section.  A vertical 1000 N load is applied
in the negative y-direction to generate the element internal loads in Subcase 1.  Once again, the Lanczos  Table 13-2  Euler Beam Results Comparison

eigenvalue extraction method is employed requesting two modes. Listing 13-6 contains the eigenvalue table
and corresponding eigenvectors.  The static deflection and buckling mode shapes are shown in Figure 13-5.
It is interesting to note that the static deflection is in the plane of the applied load (xy plane), while the
buckling mode shape is in the plane perpendicular to the applied load (xz plane).  T wo modes were requested
on the EIGRL entry to illustrate another subtle point for this problem.  The two eigenvalues are identical in
magnitude but different in sign.  What is the significance of a negative eigenvalue in a buckling analysis?  In
buckling analysis, a negative eigenvalue implies that the load that causes the structure to buckle is opposite
to the direction of the applied load.
Since both the structure and loading are symmetric, it does not matter whether the applied load is in the +y
or -y direction.  This fact brings up another subtle point.  If you specify V2 only on the EIGRL entry, then
MSC Nastran attempts to extract all the roots below V2.  In this case, these roots include all the negative
eigenvalues .  For a large model, calculating a large number of modes can be expensive especially when you
are only interested in the lowest modes.  Note that these negative roots are legitimate both from a physical
and mathematical standpoint.  In general, this situation only occurs if the applied buckling load is in the
opposite direction of the buckling load.  For this particular problem, there is no right or wrong direction.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore, in order to avoid this type of surprise, it is best to request the lowest number of desired roots  (ND)
on the EIGRL entry when you are not sure of the buckling load direction.&lt;/p&gt;

Example 3 &amp;ndash; Planar Frame Buckling
This example is a planar frame subjected to a compressive load at the top as shown in Figure 13-6.  At first
glance, since both the structure and loading are symmetrical, you may be tempted to conclude that the
structure will buckle in a symmetric mode.  As illustrated in Figure 13-7(a) and S. P . Timoshenko and J. M.
Gere, Theory of Elastic Stability  (Reference 8.), this is not the case.  The lowest buckling  mode is actually
antisymmetric.  The second buckling mode is symmetric ( Figure 13-7(b)).

Example 4 &amp;ndash; Buckling of a Stiffened Panel with Transverse Shear
Flexibility
This problem is selected to illustrate the effect of the transverse shear flexibility in the buckling failure of a
stiffened panel . Figure 13-8 consists of a panel reinforced with stiffeners at both the top and bottom.  The
panel is subjected to a distributed compressive load  at the right edge.  The failure mode of interest in this
case is the in-plane (xy plane) buckling of the stiffened panel.Table 13-4  Frame Buckling Results Comparison

Figure 13-8  Buckling of a Stiffened Panel
Results for Example 4
Part of the corresponding input file for this problem is shown in Listing 13-8.  (See
MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/stffqud4.dat) The panel is modeled with CQUAD4s.  Since only the in-plane
buckling failure mode is of interest, only the membrane stiffness  is requested for the CQUAD4s (MID1
only).  The stiffeners are modeled with CRODs.  Since this is a planar model, the out-of-plane motion is
constrained (3, 4, 5, and 6 DOFs).
The panel is subjected to a distributed compressive load  at the right end.  As an alternative modeling
technique, an RBE3 element is connected to the grid points at the right edge so that the load can be applied
to a single grid point with the RBE3 spreading the loads to the other grid points.
The SINV  method of eigenvalue extraction method is used for this problem.  Therefore, the EIGB entry
instead of the EIGRL  entry is used.  Field 3 of the EIGB  entry designates the selected method.  Fields 4 and Stiffeners A1

included when you are performing a buckling analysis in MSC Nastran.  There is no additional input
required on your part.
A review of the stresses also indicates that the structure will yield prior to reaching the linear buckling load
level.  In other words, the critical failure mode may be due to yielding rather than to the linear buckling of
the structure.  The knowledge of this linear buckling load level can still be of design significance.  If you are
interested in detailed stresses for this problem, then a nonlinear analysis using Solution 106  may be more
appropriate in this case.
Example 5 &amp;ndash; Buckling of a Cylinder Under Uniform Axial Load
The next example is the buckling of a cylinder  subjected to a distributed compressive load  at one end and
simply supported at the other end.  The cylinder has a diameter of 20 inches and a length of 20 inches with
a wall thickness of 0.03 inches as shown in Figure 13-10.  This problem illustrates the phenomenon of the
buckling  of a thin curved shell structure.

$CYLINDER ELEMENT AND GRID DATA
ENDDATA
Once again, an RBE3  element is used to distribute the load from a single grid point to the circumference of
the cylinder.
A static load of -100,000 lb is applied in Subcase 1 to generate the internal forces for the structure.  This load
is applied to the RBE3, which, in turn, distributes the loads around the circumference of the cylinder.  The
static deflection is shown in Figure 13-11.
The Lanczos  eigenvalue extraction method is used in this case to request the lowest mode.  The lowest
calculated eigenvalue  is equal to 0.34262.  The buckling load is, therefore, equal to
The corresponding buckling  mode shape is shown in Figure 13-12.  As you can see from the plots, there are
two grid points per half sine wave  (four grid points per sine wave), which is below the recommended value
of a minimum of five grid points per half sine wave.
This model can be generated with Patran ; the procedure is shown in Cylinder Buckling with Patran , 728, this
model can be generated with SimXpert; the procedure is shown in Cylinder Buckling with SimXpert, 729 .
This problem is then remeshed with 40 elements along the z-direction keeping the same mesh density in the
circumferential direction.  (See MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/buckcy) The new eigenvalue calculated in this
case is equal to 0.34234.  The revised buckling load is, therefore, equal to
The corresponding mode shape is shown in Figure 13-13.  In this case, there are three grid points per half sine
wave (six grid points per sine wave), which is still below the minimum requirement.  To obtain better
accuracy, you can certainly further refine this model until you meet the minimum number of grid points
requirement.  However, this mesh is sufficient for our goal of demonstrating the linear buckling features of

Example 6 &amp;ndash; Multiple Buckling Analyses in a Single Run
So far, a single static analysis was considered followed by a single buckling analysis.  Example 6 shows you
how to run multiple static and buckling analyses in a single run.  In fact, what is done in this example is to
combine the Euler beam buckling (Example 1) and lateral buckling (Example 2) problem into a single run
using CBEAM elements. Part of the corresponding input file is shown in Listing 13-11. (See
MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/multbuck.dat)
The model used is the same geometric beam model used in Examples 1 and 2.  The first subcase (Subcase 2)
is a static subcase consisting of a cantilever beam with a vertical tip load applied to the free end (see
Figure 13-4).  The second subcase (Subcase 5) is a static subcase consisting of a simply supported beam with
an axial load applied to the roller end (see Figure 13-2).  The third subcase (Subcase 11) is for a lateral buckling
analysis.  The Case Control command (STATSUB = 2 in Subcase 11) tells MSC Nastran that you want to
generate the differential stiffness matrix from the first static subcase (Subcase 2).  The fourth subcase (Subcase
21) is for a Euler beam buckling analysis.  The Case Control command (STATSUB = 5 in Subcase 21) tells
MSC Nastran that you want to generate the differential stiffness matrix from the second static subcase
(Subcase 5).  The Bulk Data entries are similar to Example 1.  Note that different boundary conditions are
allowed for different subcases.Table 13-6  Thin Cylinder Buckling Results Comparison

Introduction to Restarts
A restart  is a logical way of continuing from a previous run without having to start from the beginning.  The
savings can be in terms of both time and money.  You use some forms of restarts practically every day in your
life&amp;ndash;perhaps without realizing it.  An example of a restart can be as simple as reading a book.  Normally, you
probably do not finish reading a book in one continuous stretch.  You may read a hundred pages today and
another fifty pages tomorrow, and so on.  Each time that you continue from where you left off is a restart.  It
is much more time consuming and sometimes impractical to start from page one every time that you pick up
the book.
This analogy can be applied to MSC Nastran.  In the case of a static analysis, the most expensive and time-
consuming part of the run is the decomposition  of the stiffness matrix .  This fact is especially true for large
models.  Now suppose after completing the original run, you want to obtain additional output (e.g., stresses,
displacements, etc.) or add more load cases.  You can always start from the beginning and redo the whole
problem, or you can perform a restart at a fraction of the time and cost.  In the case of additional output
requests and additional load conditions, the decomposition of the stiffness matrix, which was performed in
the previous run, is not redone if the restart feature is used.
However, a restart may not always be the best option compared to rerunning the job.  Determining whether
to save the database for restarting or rerun the analysis is based on the following factors:
The amount of available disk space .
Computer speed .
The types of restarts.
The size of your model.
The discussion of restarts is divided into the following sections:
Types of restarts.
Structure of the MSC Nastran input file.
User interface.
Determining the version for a restart.
Miscellaneous applications.
Types of Restarts
There are two types of restarts available in MSC Nastran:  automatic and manual.  With automatic restarts,
MSC Nastran automatically determines which operations need to be performed during the current run based
on the changes that are made in your input file.  This includes removing matrices or tables that would be
affected by the changes and retrieving those not affected and then recalculating only what is necessary. No
user directions are required. With manual restarts, in addition to providing the necessary input file changes,
you are also responsible for telling MSC Nastran which major operations need to be performed.  The manual
restart is more difficult to use and is more prone to user error.  Restarts can use the same solution sequence
or a different solution sequence.  Restarting from a statics run and requesting stress output is an example of
a restart using the same solution sequence.  Restarting from a statics run into a normal modes run is an
example of a restart across solution sequences.  Restarts across solution sequences are beyond the scope of this&lt;/p&gt;

user’s guide.  Only automatic restarts are discussed in this chapter. Within automatic restart, it also can be
broken down to read-write restart ( User Interface for Read-Write Restart ) and read-only restart ( Read-Only Restarts ).
Structure of the MSC Nastran Input File
Before going into details on how restarts work, a simple review of the MSC Nastran input file structure  may
be beneficial.
For more information regarding the MSC Nastran input file structure, see Organization of MSC Nastran Files .
User Interface for Read-Write Restart
The two types of runs, cold start and restart, are described below:
Cold Start Run
The first run, which is called the cold start  run, is identical to what you usually do for submitting an
MSC Nastran job with the exception that the database must be saved.  In addition to your normal output
files (e.g., the .F06 file), four database  files are created as a result of this run.  The naming convention for the
filenames is machine dependent-you should refer to the Chapter 1: Introduction  for the exact syntax for your NASTRAN statements Optional
This section modifies specific Executive System default parameters.  The example problem in File
Management Section, 543  illustrates the use of NASTRAN statements.
File Management statements Optional
This section attaches and initializes MSC Nastran DBsets and FORTRAN files.  The file management
statements are described in detail in Database Management .
Executive Control statements
This section selects the solution sequence, limits the time allowed, and turns on various MSC Nastran
system diagnostics.
CEND Required Delimiter
Case Control commands
This section selects the constraints and loads from the Bulk Data entries.  It also controls the type of output
requests.

Bulk Data entries
This section contains entries that describe the model geometry, connectivity, physical properties, loads, and
constraints.  Some entries, such as constraints and loads, are selected by the appropriate Case Control

machine.  For a typical Linux  machine with an MSC Nastran input file called “stat1.dat”, the following
sample submittal command can be used:
nastran stat1 scr=no
In this case, nastran is the name of the shell script for executing MSC Nastran.  The “scr=no” option in the
above submittal command is not required if you have not modified the default value of the submittal
command as provided on the delivery media.  By default, the following three database files (see Overview of the
MSC Nastran Input File ) are created as a result of the above command:
stat1.DBALL
stat1.MASTER
stat1.IFPDAT
Restart Run
NASTRAN Statement Section
This section is normally the same as your cold start run.  Note that the BUFFSIZE  must not be changed in
a restart run.  See Database Management  regarding the NASTRAN statements.
File Management Section (FMS)
This section tells MSC Nastran that you are performing a restart run.  The RESTART  statement is required in
any restart run.  The general format for the RESTART statement is as follows:
RESTART VERSION=a,b
In the above statement, “a” is the version from which you restart (the default value for “a” is LAST); “b”
indicates whether version “a” will be kept (KEEP) or deleted (NOKEEP) at the end of the run.  The default
value for “b” is NOKEEP .  Due to the default values, the following two restart statements are identical:
RESTART VERSION=LAST,NOKEEP
RESTART
Whenever a restart is performed, a new version number  is automatically created in the database.  For each
restart, the current version number is incremented by one, regardless of whether the job ran successfully or
not.  Note that there are two exceptions to this rule (which are discussed later on in the chapter).
Restart&amp;ndash;Method 1
You also need to tell MSC Nastran the database  that you want to attach to your current run.  There are two
ways of accomplishing this goal.  One way is to use the ASSIGN  statement.  For example, if you are restarting
from the database created by stat1.dat, the following FMS statements can be used in your current run.
RESTART
assign master= ’stat1.MASTER ’
$
$  the following statement is optional
$
assign dball= ’stat1.DBALL ’
For Linux  machines, the filenames are case sensitive.  They should be entered exactly as they were created in
the cold start run and enclosed with a single quotes as shown above.  Note that the use of the second ASSIGN
statement is optional since the “master” DBset can find the associated DBALL database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;533 CHAPTER 14
Restarts
Main Index
Restart&amp;ndash;Method 2
An alternate way to attach a restart database is to use the DBS keyword on the submittal command instead
of the ASSIGN statement.  Assuming the current run is called stat2.dat, then the equivalent submittal
command is as follows:
nastran stat2 dbs=stat1
The ASSIGN statement is not needed in this case; however, the RESTART statement is needed using either
option.  While the first method requires more input than the second method, it also provides you with
information about the database used for the restart run although this information is also provided in the
Execution Summary Table (.f04 for most machines).
Executive Control Section
This section is the same as your normal run.
Case Control Section
The automatic restart  logic compares the modifications made to the Case Control and Bulk Data Sections
in determining which operations need to be processed upon restart.  Therefore, you must be very careful in
the changes that you make in your restart run.  Adhering to the following rules will avoid unnecessary
reprocessing of previously completed operations:
1.You must include in your restart run all solution-type related Case Control commands that are
unchanged as compared to the cold start run.  In other words, do not make unnecessary load, SPC,
or MPC command changes or remove them from the Case Control Section unless these are actual
changes.  This process is clarified later on with the example problems.
2.Output requests can be modified.  A typical example can be a request of the element stress output
that was not requested in the cold start  run.
Bulk Data Section
As mentioned in the previous section, the automatic restart logic compares the changes made in the Bulk
Data Section and determines the solution path to follow.  A copy of the Bulk Data is stored for each version.&lt;br&gt;
The restart run must not contain any Bulk Data entries that were included with the previous version that
you are restarting from since they are already saved in the database for that particular version.  The Bulk Data
Section in the current restart run should only contain the addition of new entries, the modification of old
entries, or the deletion of old entries from the database.  The following is a series of three runs illustrating an
application of a restart.  The first run ( Listing 14-1) is a sample statics run with one loading condition, and it
requests displacement output. (See MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/stat1.dat)

ENDDATA
The second run ( Listing 14-2) is a restart run with an additional load condition.  (See
MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/stat2.dat) Displacement and stress outputs are desired for this new loading
condition.  Furthermore, stress output for all the elements is desired for Subcase 1.  However, since you
already printed the displacement for Subcase 1 in your original run, you may elect not to reprint this
information by removing the displacement request from Subcase 1.  There are no model changes as compared
to the original run.  Note that the Bulk Data entries that were present in the original run must not be included
in the current run.  The only entry in the Bulk Data Section is the new FORCE entry for Subcase 2, which
was not included in the original run.  Since this load is a new loading condition, the FORCE entry must have
an unique ID (2 in this case) as compared to the existing FORCE entry ID (1 in this case) that is stored in
the database.
In the FMS  Section, only two statements are needed.  They are the “restart” statement to tell MSC Nastran
that this current run is a restart run and the “assign” statement that tells MSC Nastran the name of the
database you want to attach.  This type of restart  run constitutes an efficient restart since the re-
decomposition of the stiffness matrix is not performed; for a large problem, this can result in substantial
savings.&lt;/p&gt;

Restarts
Main Index
The third run ( Listing 14-3) is a restart run with a modification in the material property.  (See
MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/stat3.dat) The same two loading conditions are used as run number two.  A
replacement material entry is added in this run and the old material entry, from the stat2.dat run, is deleted.
See the / Bulk Data entry. Since UPDATE is the default for processing entries on restarts, only the
replacement material entry is needed in the Bulk Data Section.
You can have as many of these entries as you need.
The unsorted Bulk Data is output by default.  Use the ECHO Case Control command is specified in the
cold start run, it should be set to output the sorted Bulk Data (e.g., ECHO=SORT).
The general format for deleting an entry from the database is

in this case it would be

There may be times when you may be making substantial changes to the model.  In this case, it may be easier
to delete the whole Bulk Data listing from the database  and insert a complete new Bulk Data file as shown
below:
/DELETE ALL
$
$   include a complete new bulk data listing
$
As an alternative method, you may consider deleting the database files and run the problem as a cold start run.
This type of restart (run number 3) requires the reformulation of the stiffness matrix since the material was
changed.  For a nonsuperelement run, this type of restart does not save you much in terms of runtime, if any.&lt;br&gt;
This run (run number 3) is included merely to show you how to update or delete information from the
database.  However, for superelement  type runs, this type of restart can still save you time since you may only
be resolving a portion of the structure.  The use of superelements is beyond the scope of this user’s guide.
The model used in the above series of runs is quite simple.  In most cases, such simple models do not warrant
the use of a restart since the savings are insignificant for such a small model.  This simple example is chosen Listing 14-3  Input File for a Restart Run with Modified Material Property Entry

Restarts
Main Index
to illustrate the mechanics of how simple the restart feature is without being distracted by the details of a
complex model.
Determining the Version for a Restart
Not all versions in the database are restartable.  For each run, a message is printed near the top of the .F04
file indicating the version number of the current job.  In general, if a job completes without any fatal messages
and the database is saved, then that particular version is restartable.  It is a good idea to keep a brief log of all
the restartable versions  since this is probably the most reliable source of information regarding whether a
version is restartable.  If a restart job failed, e.g., due to Bulk Data error, then this newly created version is
not restartable, and it is indicated as such by the following error message at the bottom of the .f06 file.
In this case, you must restart from a previous valid version.  The “xxx” and “yyy” above denote version
numbers.  The “zzz” denotes a project description provided by you.  This project description is alphanumeric
and can contain up to 40 characters with the default being blank.  The project  description is rarely used and
is an optional statement.
If for some reason the records for the old runs are no longer available, then the DBDIR FMS statement can
be used to query the database contents to find out which versions are stored in the database. The following
simple setup is all that is required for this purpose:
ASSIGN MASTER= ’ddddd.MASTER ’
DBDIR VERSION=&lt;em&gt;,PROJECT=&lt;/em&gt;
ENDJOB
Neither the Executive, Case Control, nor Bulk Data Section is required in this case.  Furthermore, a new
version is not created in this case because the ENDJOB  statement is present.  Near the top of the .F06 output,
a PROJECT VERSION DIRECTORY TABLE is printed listing all the versions in the database.  A “&lt;strong&gt;” next
to a version number indicates that this particular version was deleted from the database.  This deletion may
be due to the “NOKEEP” option or the use of the  DBCLEAN  statement when performing a restart run.  A
version number with a “&lt;/strong&gt;” next to it is not restartable.  A version number without a “&lt;strong&gt;” next to it is
restartable if the run that created the version did not terminate with UFM 784.  This DBDIR FMS statement
can also be used to check the database directory for the existence of data blocks (e.g., UG).  If the job fails
very early in the run (e.g., error in the FMS section), then a new version may not be created.
It is always a good practice to back up the database on a regular basis.  If the system aborts the run (e.g., disk
space is exhausted or the time quota is exceeded on a system level), then there is a chance that the database&lt;br&gt;
is corrupted.  Another good practice, which ensures that only good models are retained in the database, is to
perform the following:
1.Use RESTART VERSION=a,KEEP
where “a” is a version number.&lt;/strong&gt;* USER WARNING MESSAGE 784 (XCLNUP)
VERSION =  yyy PROJECT =  “zzz”  OF THIS DATA BASE IS NOT VALID FOR RESTART PURPOSES.
USER ACTION:
SUBSEQUENT RESTARTS SHOULD REFERENCE VERSION =  xxx OR A PRIOR VALID VERSION&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Linear Statics Analysis User’s Guide
Read-Only Restarts538
Main Index
2.If a version contains errors, or is no longer of interest, then you can use the FMS statement
DBCLEAN to remove obsolete or incorrect versions of the model from the database.  Using
DBCLEAN allows the Executive System to reuse some of this space for new versions.  The
DBCLEAN statement is discussed in detail in Database Management .
Read-Only Restarts
Read-only restart is very similar to read-write restart as described in User Interface for Read-Write Restart  with one
exception: The original database is accessed in a read-only mode. No new data is added to the existing
database. Instead, all new data is written to the new database, leaving the original database intact. The new
database can be deleted, or it can be saved for restart purposes. The new database created during the restart
run will retain an internal link to the original database.
To use read-only restart for the same example problem as in Listing 14-2, all you need to do is modify the FMS
statements from:
Restart
Assign master=’stat1.MASTER’
to:
Restart logical=run2
Assign run2=’stat1.MASTER’
In this case, run2 is an arbitrary logical name.
Mini-Database Restarts
It is possible to save on the database only those data blocks that are required for data recovery.  The size of
the database, called a mini-database, is on average about 25% the size of a full database.  For pure data
recovery run (no spc or loading changes), this type of restart is very efficient.
To use this feature, use the following submittal command
nastran jobname scr=mini
in the cold start run.
In the restart run, use the DBS= or RESTART+ assign method to select your cold start database, modify your
Case Control output requests and remove your Bulk Data entries. The restart will process any output request
from the table below.
The mini-database restart processes the following Case Control commands and user parameters in SOL 101:&lt;/p&gt;

Main Index
For cyclic symmetry analysis (see Cyclic Symmetry , 555) the HOUTPUT and NOUTPUT cannot be changed
in the restart run.
Miscellaneous Applications
Aside from the conventional restarts described in the previous sections, there are other applications in which
restarts can be used.
Bulk Data Listing
There may be occasions when for some reason an old input file is no longer available, but the database  is still
archived somewhere.  The following sample run ( Listing 14-4) allows you to either print or punch a copy of
the Bulk Data from the database.  The term “punch” is an old term from the earlier days when punched cards
were generated.  The “punch output” in this case actually refers to an output file, and this file can
subsequently be used as an input file.

Main Index
By now you can see the advantages of automatic restarts .  They are easy to use, and they can potentially save
you a substantial amount of time&amp;ndash;both CPU and elapsed  time&amp;ndash;by not having to resolve a problem from the
beginning.  One disadvantage is that you have to save the database. Using restarts also requires a bit more
bookkeeping.
For conventional static analysis runs (i.e, those not involving superelements), if a restart involves model
changes, the savings is probably minimal.  However, in the case of additional output requests or additional
load cases, the savings can be substantial.&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction to Database Management
This chapter is intended to give you an overview of how the database and the File Management Section
(FMS)  work so that you can allocate your resources efficiently, especially for large models. For many
problems, you may not need to concern yourself with the knowledge or use of the FMS&amp;ndash;in such cases, MSC
Nastran uses built-in, default values to handle database allocation and file assignments. However, there are
cases in which knowledge of the FMS may be required. This chapter contains the basic use of FMS
statements, for complex, large problems see Using the Basic Functions of MSC Nastran  (Ch. 4), Using the Advanced
Functions of MSC Nastran  (Ch. 5) in the  and Database Concepts  (Ch. 10) in the MSC Nastran Reference Guide .
Definitions
Before presenting the details of the database structure, the definitions for some of the basic terms that are used
throughout this chapter need to be presented.
MSC Nastran Database
When submitting a MSC Nastran job, a series of standard output files is created (e.g., the .f06 file).  The
naming convention for the filenames is machine dependent.  Furthermore, by default, two permanent DBsets
(MASTER, DBALL) and three scratch (SCRATCH, SGR300, and OBJSCR) DBset are created during the
run. The default blocks shown is for the smallest memory and buffsize, see Table 4-6 in the MSC Nastran
Installation and Operations Guide  for the various default sizes. DBset Database set. DBset consists of an MSC Nastran logical name, such as MASTER ,
DBALL , etc., which refers to an entity within the MSC Nastran database.  It consists
of a collection of physical files.
Database The collection of all DBsets assigned to a run.
Data block A matrix or table (e.g., KAA, LAMA) that is stored in the database.
Logical name The local internal name (log-name) used by MSC Nastran for a file or DBset.
Word For 32- and 64-bit machines, each word is equivalent to four and eight bytes,
respectively.
BUFFSIZE The length of an MSC Nastran buffer in terms of words (32- or 64-bit words).  It
controls the physical record size for data storage/transfer that is contained in many
MSC Nastran logical units.  The default and maximum allowable BUFFSIZE  is
machine dependent. The default value is recommended except for large problems.  It
can be modified by using the following NASTRAN statement:
NASTRAN BUFFSIZE = xxxxx
Block A block is often referred to as an MSC Nastran GINO block .  Each GINO block
contains one MSC Nastran buffer.  The size of each block is equal to BUFFSIZE-1
words. (GINO is an acronym for general input/output.)
{ } A brace indicates that the quantity within this bracket is mandatory.
[ ] A square bracket indicates that the quantity within this bracket is optional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;543 CHAPTER 15
Database Management
Main Index
For a typical Linux-based workstation with an MSC Nastran input file called “stat1.dat”, the following
sample submittal command can be used:
nastran stat1 scr=no
In the command above, nastran is the name of the shell script used to execute MSC Nastran.  The following
two permanent physical database files are created as a result of the above command.
stat1.MASTER
stat1.DBALL
Note that the temporary scratch files are allocated and used by MSC Nastran during the course of the run
and are deleted at the end of the run.  Unless otherwise stated, the input filename is assumed to be “stat1.dat”
in this chapter.
File Management Section
The File Management Section (FMS)  is intended primarily for the attachment and initialization of
MSC Nastran database sets (DBsets) and FORTRAN files.  For many problems due to the default values,
the FMS  is handled automatically and is not required to be specified by you.  At first glance, the FMS may
be overwhelming, which is due in part to its flexibility and the many options it has to offer.  However, in its
most commonly used form, it can be quite simple.  Examples of its most commonly used forms are provided
throughout this chapter.
You can allocate the database file size in any of the following units:
Byte (B), Word (W)
Kilobyte (KB), Kiloword (K or KW)
Megabyte (MB), Megaword (M or MW)
Gigabyte (GB), Gigaword (G or GW)MASTER This is the “directory” DBset that contains a list of all the DBsets used in the job, all the
physical file names assigned, and an index pointing to all the data blocks created and
where they are stored.  In addition, it also contains the MSC Nastran data definition
language (NDDL).  The NDDL is the internal MSC Nastran language that describes
the database.  You do not need to understand the NDDL in order to use MSC Nastran
effectively.  The default maximum size for MASTER is 5,000 blocks.
DBALL The DBset  where the permanent data blocks are stored by default.  The default size is
250,000 blocks.
SCRATCH The DBset used as the temporary workspace for MSC Nastran.  In general, this DBset
is deleted at the end of the run.  The default size is 250,000 blocks.
SCR300 The DBset used as the temporary workspace for the modules. This space is released at
the end of the module execution to be reused by subsequent modules. The default size
is 250,000 blocks.
OBJSCR T emporary DBset for DMAP compilation. The default size is 5000 blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Linear Statics Analysis User’s Guide
File Management Section544
Main Index
Terabyte (TB) or Teraword (T or TW)
MSC Nastran BUFFSIZE blocks (Default)
Mixture of the above units
Internally, MSC Nastran converts them to GINO blocks.  There are about 20 FMS statements available in
MSC Nastran.  This section covers the commonly used FMS statements in static analysis and each is
presented in its most commonly used format, which in general, is a simplified format.
If an FMS statement is longer than 72 characters, it must be continued on the next line.  You can have a
maximum of 200 files (FORTRAN and DBsets) assigned (online) at a time.  This limit may be less for some
machines due to their operating system limit.
INIT
Creates/initializes permanent and/or temporary DBsets.  The File Management statement INIT in the MSC
Nastran  Quick Reference Guide  has two basic formats: one for all the DBsets and one specifically for the
SCRATCH DBsets.
Format (Simplified) for All DBsets Except SCRATCH DBsets
INIT DBset-name [LOGICAL=(log-name1(max-size1)   ,
log-name2(max-size2),&amp;hellip;log-namei(max-sizei)  ,
&amp;hellip;log-namen(max-sizen))]
Example A
The following statement creates the DBALL  DBset  with a logical name of DBALL and the maximum size of
50,000 MSC Nastran blocks instead of 250,000 blocks, which is the default value for DBALL:
INIT DBALL LOGICAL=(DBALL(50000))
Assuming that your input file is called “stat1.dat”, the physical file has the name stat1.DBALL unless an
ASSIGN statement is also used.
Unless you need to split DBALL into logical/physical files, the SDBALL=size nastran command keyword (see
Keywords and Environment Variables  in the MSC Nastran Installation and Operations Guide) is a quick way to set
DBALL to a specific size, such as SDBSIZE=50000.
The following statement creates the DBALL DBset with logical names of DB1 and DBTWO:
INIT DBALL LOGICAL=(DB1(35000),DBTWO(60000))
The two physical files stat1.DB1 and stat1.DBTWO are created with a maximum of 35,000 and 60,000
MSC Nastran blocks , respectively.DBset-name The logical name of the DBset being used (e.g., DBALL).
log-namei The i-th logical name for the DBset-name referenced in this INIT statement.  You can
have up to 20 logical names for each DBset (1 &amp;lt;n &amp;lt; 20 ).  An ASSIGN statement may
be used to attach a physical file to the i-th logical file.
max-sizei The maximum allowable size that may be written to the i-th file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;545 CHAPTER 15
Database Management
Main Index
Format (Simplified) for the SCRATCH DBset
INIT SCRATCH [LOGICAL=(log-name1(max-size1)   ,
log-name2(max-size2),&amp;hellip;log-namei(max-sizei))  ,
SCR300=(log-namei+1(max-sizei+1),&amp;hellip;log-namen(max-sizen))]
Log-name1 through log-namei are allocated for regular scratch files as temporary workspace.  This space is
not released until the end of the job.  SCR300 is a special keyword that indicates the log-names are members
reserved for DMAP  module internal scratch files.  The space occupied by these files is for the duration of the
execution of the module.  This space is released at the end of the module execution.  You can have up to a
combined total of 20 logical names for the SCRATCH DBset  (1 &amp;lt; n &amp;lt; 20).
Example B
The following statement creates the SCRATCH DBset with logical names of SCR1, SCR2, SCRA, and
SCRB:
INIT SCRATCH LOGICAL=(SCR1(150MW),SCR2(100MW)) ,
SCR300=(SCRA(250MW),SCRB(300MW))
The two physical files stat1.SCR1 and stat1.SCR2 are created with maximum sizes of 150 and 100
megawords, respectively.  These two files are regular scratch files.  T wo additional physical files stat1.SCRA
and stat1.SCRB are created with maximum sizes of 250 and 300 megawords, respectively.  These last two
files are SCR300-type files.
Again, unless you need to split SCRATCH into logical/physical files, the SSCR=size nastran command
keyword (see Keywords and Environment Variables  in the MSC Nastran Installation and Operations Guide ) is a
quick way to set SCRATCH to a specific size, such as SCCR=800MW.
ASSIGN
The File Management statement ASSIGN  in the MSC Nastran Installation and Operations Guide assigns
physical filenames to logical filenames or special FORTRAN files that are used by other FMS  statements or
DMAP  modules.
Format (Simplified) to Assign Logical Files
ASSIGN log-namei=’filenamei’ [TEMP DELETE]
log-namei The i-th logical name for the DBset created by the INIT  statement.
TEMP Requests that filenamei be deleted at the end of the job.
DELETE Requests that filenamei be deleted if it exists before the start of the run.  This is optional;
however, if this option is not used and the file exists prior to the current run, then the
job may fail with the following messages:
*** USER FATAL MESSAGE 773 (DBDEF)
THE FOLLOWING PHYSICAL FILE ALREADY EXISTS.
LOGICAL NAME  = xxxx
PHYSICAL FILE = yyyy
USER INFORMATION: NO ASSOCIATED DEFAULT FILES OR ASSIGNED DBSETS CAN
EXIST PRIOR TO THE DATA BASE INITIALIZATION RUN.
USER ACTION: DELETE THIS FILE AND RESUBMIT THE JOB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Linear Statics Analysis User’s Guide
File Management Section546
Main Index
DELETE is not a suggested option if you are using RESTART since you can delete your database
inadvertently.  Manual deletion of unwanted databases is a safer approach.
Example C
The following statements create a logical name DB1 for the DBset DBALL in the current directory:
ASSIGN DB1=’sample.DB1’
INIT DBALL LOGICAL=(DB1(50000))
The physical file sample.DB1 is created in this case.  Without the ASSIGN  statement, the physical filename
created is called stat1.DB1, assuming once again that your input file is called stat1.dat.
The following statements create the two logical names DB1 and DB2 for the DBset DBALL:
ASSIGN DB1=’/mydisk1/se/sample.DB1’
ASSIGN DB2=’/mydisk2/sample.DB2’
INIT DBALL LOGICAL=(DB1(50000),DB2(40000))
DB1 points to a physical file called sample.DB1 that resides in the file system (directory) /mydisk1/se.  DB2
points to a physical file called sample.DB2 that resides in the file system (directory) /mydisk2. Generally this
is used when a file will not fit on one disk drive.
Format (Simplified) to Assign FORTRAN Files
ASSIGN log-key=’filenamef’ [STATUS={new,old},UNIT=u ,
FORM={FORMATTED, UNFORMATTED },DELETE]
DBC,DBMIG,INPUTT2,INPUTT4,OUTPUT2,OUTPUT4,
DBUNLOAD,DBLOAD, and USERFILE.&lt;br&gt;
See the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide  for detailed descriptions of these keywords and their default values.
Example D
The following example creates a new FORTRAN  file to be used for OUTPUT2 operations:log-key This is the logical keyword for the FORTRAN  file being assigned.  This file may already
exist.  The default value depends on the keyword.  Acceptable keywords are
filenamef The physical name of the FORTRAN file.
STATUS Specifies whether the FORTRAN file is created (STATUS = new) or is an existing file
(STATUS = old).
UNIT Specifies the FORTRAN unit (e.g., UNIT = 12).
FORM Specifies whether the file written is in ASCII (FORM = FORMATTED) or binary
(FORM = UNFORMATTED) format.  Note that if the log-key is OUTPUT2, the
FORMATTED output is in compressed ASCII format.
DELETE  Requests that filenamef be deleted, if it exists before the start of the run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;547 CHAPTER 15
Database Management
Main Index
ASSIGN OUTPUT2=’sample.out’,STATUS=NEW,UNIT=11,FORM=FORMATTED
This FORTRAN file is in compressed ASCII  format with a filename of sample.out and is assigned to unit
11.  Note that a compressed ASCII file can be transferred directly across machines, but it should not be
edited.  For more information regarding the transfer of OUTPUT2 files across machines, see the MSC
Nastran Installation and Operations Guide .
EXPAND
The File Management statement EXPAND  in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide  concatenates  files into
an existing DBset  in order to increase the allowable disk space available for MSC Nastran.  The EXPAND&lt;br&gt;
statement is normally used in a restart run when you exceed the disk space allocation in your previous run.
Format
EXPAND DBset-name LOGICAL=(log-namei(max-sizei),&amp;hellip; )
Only one EXPAND statement is allowed per run.
Example E
The original run creates a database with the name stat1.DBALL.  However, this database was filled and the
job failed with the following error messages in the .F06 file:
For small to medium problems, it is best to rerun the job from the beginning with a larger file allocation.&lt;br&gt;
For large problems, if rerunning the job is not practical, then the database can be expanded with the following
FMS statements:
RESTART
ASSIGN MASTER=’stat1.MASTER’
ASSIGN DBADD=’morespace.DB’
EXPAND DBALL LOGICAL=(DBADD(50000))
These statements assign an additional member, with a logical name of DBADD, to the existing DBset
DBALL .  This member points to a new physical file called morespace.DB, which may contain up to a
maximum of 50,000 MSC Nastran blocks.  You are restarting from “stat1.MASTER” in this case.
The EXPAND  statement cannot be used for the scratch files since they are deleted at the end of each job.DBset-name The logical name of the DBset to be expanded by the addition of new members to an
existing DBset previously defined with an INIT statement.
log-namei The logical name of the i-th member of the DBset.  An ASSIGN statement should be
used to point this logical name to a physical file.
max-sizei The maximum size of the i-th member.
*** USER FATAL MESSAGE 1012 (GALLOC)
DBSET DBALL IS FULL AND NEEDS TO BE EXPANDED.&lt;/p&gt;

Main Index
RESTART
The File Management statement RESTART  in the MSC Nastran Installation and Operations Guide allows you
to continue from the end of the previous run without solving the problem from the beginning.
Format
RESTART [PROJECT=’proj-ID’, VERSION={version-ID, LAST},
{KEEP,NOKEEP}]
Example F
The following statement causes the current run to use the last version in the database for the restart:
RESTART
At the end of the run, this last version that you are restarting from is deleted from the database .  This is
probably the most commonly used form for RESTART .
The following statement instructs the current run (version 6 or higher) to use version 5 in the database for
restart:
RESTART VERSION=5,KEEP
At the end of the run, version 5 is also retained in the database.  This format is used most often when you
want to ensure that a specific version is saved in the database (e.g., a large run from which you may want to
request additional data recovery in the future).
The following statement specifies that the current run (version 4 or higher with a proj-ID of xyz) uses version
3 with a proj-ID of xyz in the database for restart:
RESTART PROJ=’xyz’ VERSION=3
At the end of the run, version 3 with a proj-ID of xyz is deleted from the database.
DBCLEAN
The File Management statement DBCLEAN  in the MSC Nastran Installation and Operations Guide deletes
unwanted versions  from the database .  The DBCLEAN statement does not reduce the size of the database.&lt;br&gt;
This statement deletes the data blocks for the specified versions to allow other data blocks to reuse this space
for subsequent restarts without potentially increasing the database size.  Up to ten DBCLEAN  statements can
be used in the FMS  for each run.proj-ID Project identifier used in the original run.  It can have up to 40 characters.  This option
is optional and is normally not used.  The default proj-ID is blank.
version-ID The version number that you are restarting from.
KEEP If this option is used, then the version that you are restarting from is also saved at the
end of the current run.
NOKEEP If this option is used, then the version that you are restarting from is deleted at the end
of the current run.&lt;/p&gt;

This run also brings two additional files (bulk1.dat and bulk2.dat) into the Bulk Data Section.  You may, for
example, want to include all your grid entries in file bulk1.dat and all your element connectivities in
bulk2.dat.  As you can see, the INCLUDE statement can be a handy tool.  For parametric studies, you can
potentially save a tremendous amount of editing and disk space by using the INCLUDE statement instead
of having multiple files with duplicate input data.
Guidelines for Large Problems
As mentioned previously, for most small to medium problems, the default values for all the file assignments
should be more than adequate.  However, for a large problem, larger disk space allocation may be necessary.
Resources for computers are much more plentiful then when NASTRAN was initially developed, so only very
large problems need resource estimation. Several examples are shown in this section that illustrate various
options and consequences with each option.  The submittal command for each example is shown followed
by a partial listing of the corresponding input file.  In each case, it is assumed that you are running on a Linux
machine with “nastran” as the name of the shell script executing MSC Nastran.

The following submittal command and FMS statements allocate 300,000 and 5,000 MSC Nastran GINO
blocks for DBALL  and MASTER , respectively:

INIT SCRATCH,LOGICAL=(SCRATCH(200000)) ,
SCR300=(SCR300(200000))
$
$  THE REST OF YOUR INPUT FILE
$
Furthermore, the following physical files are created and saved in your current directory:
runa.DBALL
runa.MASTER
These statements also allocate 200,000 and 200,000 MSC Nastran GINO blocks for SCRATCH  and
SCR300 , respectively.  These two files are allocated to the default scratch directory during the course of the
run and are deleted at the end of the run.  Since the database  is saved, this job is restartable. An equivalent
submittal command is:
NASTRAN RUNA DBALL=300000 SSCR=400000 SCR=NO
and the INIT FMS statements are not needed.
When using the “scr = yes” option on the submittal command, the permanent data blocks that are normally
written to the DBALL DBset are now written to the SCRATCH DBset.
Example J
The submittal command and FMS  statements below allocate 50, 500, and 800 megabytes  for DBALL ,
SCRATCH , and SCR300 , respectively.  Furthermore, by default, 5,000 MSC Nastran GINO blocks are
allocated each for the MASTER  dbset.  During the course of the run, all of these files are allocated to your
default scratch directory.  Because you are using the “scr=yes” option on the submittal command, the
permanent data blocks that are normally written to the DBALL DBset are now written to the SCRATCH
DBset.  In other words, you must allocate the disk space to the SCRATCH DBset, which you would
normally allocate to the DBALL DBset , when you use the “scr=yes” option on the submittal command.  At
the end of the run, all of these files are deleted automatically; this action is different from the previous
versions of MSC Nastran.  Since the database  is not saved, this job is not restartable.

If you have sufficient disk space in your current and default scratch file systems (disk packs), the methods
shown in Example I or Example J are the preferred procedures since it is the simpliest method.  However, if
you do not have sufficient disk space in a file system, but have other file systems (e.g., /disk2, /disk3, and
/disk4) mounted to your system, then the procedure listed below can be used.  You must have read and write
privileges in order to use these file systems.  For this example, the three new file systems are /disk2, /disk3,
and /disk4.

The permanent database is broken up into two separate logical files (DBALL1 and DBALL2).  The above
run allocates 200,000 and 100,000 kilobytes for DBALL1 and DBALL2, respectively.  The run also allocates
5,000 GINO blocks  for the MASTER  dbset.  DBALL1 is allocated to the current directory that you are
running on with the physical filename of “runc.db1&amp;quot;.  DBALL2 is allocated to the “/disk2/user_guide/statics”
directory with a physical filename of “runc.db2&amp;quot;.  The following additional physical file is also created in your
current directory:
runc.MASTER
These three files are saved at the end of the run and the job is restartable.
The regular SCRATCH  and SCR300  files are each divided into two separate files.  T wo logical files
(SCRATCH1 and SCRATCH2) are assigned to the regular SCRATCH file.  SCRATCH1 is assigned to the
default scratch directory requesting 100,000 GINO blocks.  SCRATCH2 is assigned to the
“/disk3/user_guide/statics” directory with a filename of “runc.scrtch2&amp;quot; and requesting 100,000 GINO
blocks.  The SCR300 file is also divided into two files (SC3A and SC3B).  SC3A requests 150,000 blocks
and assigns this disk space to the default scratch directory.  SC3B requests 50,000 blocks and assigns this disk
space to the “/disk4/user_guide/statics” directory with a filename of “runc.sc3b”.  All four of these scratch
files are deleted at the end of the run.
Example L
Even though the setup in Example K looks virtually the same as that in Example L, the “scr=yes” keyword
causes the permanent data blocks-that are normally written to the DBALL DBset-to be written to the
SCRATCH DBset.  In other words, except for the amount used for overhead, the space that you have
allocated to DBALL1 and DBALL2 is not used at all.  You must adjust the disk space allocation to the
SCRATCH DBset that you normally would allocate to the DBALL DBset when you use the “scr=yes” option&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;553 CHAPTER 15

on the submittal command.  The correct action in this case is to increase the disk space allocation for
SCRATCH1 and SCRATCH2, and decrease the disk space allocation for DBALL1 and DBALL2.  Once
again, since the database is not saved, this job is not restartable.

BUFFSIZE
BUFFSIZE (1)  is the length of an MSC Nastran buffer in terms of words (32- or 64-bit words).  It controls the
physical record size for data storage/transfer that is contained in many MSC Nastran logical units.  The
default and maximum allowable buffsize is machine dependent.  The default value is recommended except
for large problems.  Each 32-, and 64-bit word contains 4 and 8 bytes, respectively.  This feature can be
invoked by including the following NASTRAN statement in your input file ( Structure of the MSC Nastran Input
File).
NASTRAN BUFFSIZE=xxxxx
where xxxxx = ( ) + 1  &amp;lt; limit and n is a positive integer. Default is 8193.
The acceptable values of disk-block-size and limit are machine dependent and are defined in the
MSC Nastran Installation and Operations Guide .
A larger BUFFSIZE takes fewer requests of the computer operating system to transfer the same amount of
data, with each transfer involving a larger physical record size.  This can reduce the I/O time  which, in turn,
reduces the elapsed time.  In general, the effect on CPU time  is insignificant.  A larger BUFFSIZE decreases
the number of I/O operations but may increase the database size.  Since each data block uses at least one
buffer and the read/write operation requires a minimum of one buffer.
Disk space allocation is affected by the BUFFSIZE if the disk space units are in terms of GINO blocks.&lt;br&gt;
GINO blocks  are related to words  by the following equation:
(15-1)
Example M illustrates the use of a non-default BUFFSIZE.

Assume the machine that you are running on has a default BUFFSIZE  of 8193.  If you increase the
BUFFSIZE to 65537, using Equation (15-1), this example allocates the same maximum amount of physical
disk space as Example I, which uses the default BUFFSIZE.

$
$  THE REST OF YOUR INPUT FILE
$
BUFFSIZE=65537 is the maximum allowed.  Total memory allocation can be controlled by the “mem”
keyword on the submittal line.  The following example allocates 2 GB of total memory for the run.
nastran stat1 mem=2GB
A portion of this total memory is allocated to the Executive System.  The rest of the memory is then available
to the functional modules in MSC Nastran.  Assuming that you are using the default SCRATCH(MEM) and
BUFFERPOOL, the portion of the memory that is available for your problem is denoted as “User
OPENCORE (HICORE)”, and can be estimated by Equation (15-2).
(15-2)
As you can see for Equation (15-2), the amount of memory allocated to the Executive System is a function of
the BUFFSIZE.  As the BUFFSIZE increases, a larger portion of the total memory is allocated to the
Executive System.  A summary of the MSC Nastran memory utilization is printed near the beginning of the
.F04 file. You can also let MSC Nastran estimate the amount of required memory by using the following
submittal command:
nastran stat1 mem=estimate
Summary
Due to the choice of the default values, very little knowledge of the MSC Nastran FMS statements and
database structure is required for small to medium problems.  For large problems, however, some knowledge
of the FMS statements and database structure can help you to allocate and optimize your computer resources.User OPENCOREmem BUFFSIZE150  500KW – –&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction to Cyclic Symmetry
The symmetry  of a structure can be exploited in order to reduce the quantity of input data and to reduce the
cost of computation.  If your loading has the same symmetry as the structure, only a single analysis is required
for a symmetrical subregion of the structure with symmetrical boundary conditions.  If your loading is
unsymmetrical, the following additional tasks must be performed:
1.Separate applied loads into symmetry sets (e.g., symmetrical and antisymmetrical sets for a structure
with one plane of symmetry).
2.Apply separate constraint sets to a subregion of the structure in order to model the boundary
conditions  corresponding to each symmetry condition.
3.Compute separate solutions for each symmetry condition.
4.Combine the results for each symmetry condition to obtain the complete solution for the complete
structure.
In MSC Nastran’s cyclic symmetry option, Solution 114, all of these tasks are performed automatically.  This
option can be used for several types of symmetry, including reflective symmetry , axisymmetry , and rotational
symmetry  (i.e., identical components symmetrically arranged about an axis).
MSC Nastran also includes a way of handling the special case of unsymmetric loads on a structure with one
or two planes of symmetry (discussed in Modeling Guidelines ).  With this method you must perform Tasks 1
and 2 in the above list by hand.  Task 3 is accomplished by creating subcases for each symmetry condition,
with different SPC sets and loading conditions for each subcase.  Task 4 is accomplished with SYMCOM (Case)&lt;br&gt;
and SYMSEQ (Case)  Case Control commands or with SUBCOM (Case)  and SUBSEQ (Case)  Case Control commands
(see Organization of MSC Nastran Files ).
Description of Geometric Symmetry in MSC Nastran
When an engineer speaks of a symmetrical structure, he usually means a structure that has one or more planes
of reflective symmetry.  Reflective symmetry is, however, only one of the several different types of geometric
symmetry shown in Figure 16-1.&lt;/p&gt;

Figure 16-1 Types of Geometrical Symmetry (continued)
In rotational symmetry, Figure 16-1(b), the structure is made up of identical segments that are symmetrically
arranged about an axis.  If the structure has only two segments, the second segment is created by rotating the
first segment through 180 about an axis A.  In general, the n-th segment is created by rotating the
fundamental region (i.e., the first segment) through 360(n-1)/N degrees about axis A where N is the total
number of segments.  Common examples of structures with rotational symmetry are skew slabs and many
types of rotating machinery including gears, electric motors, turbines, and helicopter rotors.
Dihedral symmetry, Figure 16-1(c), is a special case of rotational symmetry that combines rotational and
reflective symmetry since each segment has its own plane of reflective symmetry.  Thus, in Figure 16-1(c), half-
segment 1L is the mirror image of half-segment 1R (the fundamental region), and these two halves of segment A

1 are rotated together through 120  to form segment 2 and through 240  to form segment 3.  Water towers
and reinforced domed roofs are familiar examples of structures with dihedral symmetry.
In translational symmetry, Figure 16-1(d), the fundamental region is endlessly repeated by translation in a
straight line.  T ranslational symmetry can clearly be extended to two and three dimensions.  An example of
a structural problem with this type of symmetry is the analysis of the buckling of a long rail with periodic
flexible supports.
In axisymmetry, Figure 16-1(e), the object is generated by rotating the fundamental region continuously about
an axis, thereby forming a solid of revolution.  Two subclasses may be distinguished.  In the first subclass, the
fundamental region is a plane surface, and in the second subclass, the fundamental region is a skewed surface.&lt;br&gt;
These two subclasses are distinguishable only if the mechanical properties of the fundamental region are
anisotropic. Examples of structures with skewed axisymmetry may be found in nature (e.g., the trunks of
pine trees) and in spiral-wound reinforced shells.  Examples of axisymmetry without skew are too numerous
to mention.
Just as axisymmetry with skew and axisymmetry without skew are subclasses of axisymmetry, you may
consider rotational symmetry, dihedral symmetry and axisymmetry to be subclasses of the general class of
symmetry defined by the rotation of a fundamental region about an axis, which is  called cyclic symmetry.&lt;br&gt;
Within this class, axisymmetry without skew is seen to be a limiting case of dihedral symmetry as the number
of segments is increased without limit, and axisymmetry with skew is seen to be a limiting case of rotational
symmetry.  In practice, the axisymmetric case is approached with sufficient accuracy by having a large, but
finite, number of segments.
Also, reflective symmetry with one or two planes of symmetry is a special case of dihedral symmetry.  As
illustrated in Figure 16-2, reflective symmetry with one plane of symmetry is identical to dihedral symmetry
with one segment, and reflective symmetry with two planes of symmetry is identical to dihedral symmetry
with two segments.&lt;/p&gt;

Thus, most of the types of symmetry shown in Figure 16-1 are subclasses of cyclic symmetry.  Even
translational symmetry in one direction, see Figure 16-1(d), can be considered to be a limiting case of
rotational symmetry in which the axis of symmetry is infinitely far away.
The relationship of the different classes of symmetry to the general class called cyclic symmetry is summarized
in Figure 16-1.  With few exceptions, all important types of symmetry are subclasses of cyclic symmetry, and
they can, therefore, be analyzed with the cyclic symmetry capability in MSC Nastran. 1L

The existence of geometric symmetry can be used to reduce the cost of finite element analysis in the following
three ways:
1.By restricting the input data describing the finite element model to the fundamental region.
2.By restricting the computation of g-size  stiffness and mass matrices to the fundamental region.
3.By exploiting the orthogonality of symmetrical component sets, such as the symmetrical and
antisymmetrical sets in reflective symmetry, to reduce the cost of matrix operations.
If the loads on the structure have the same symmetry as the structure itself, the entire analysis reduces to a
solution for the fundamental region with the appropriate boundary conditions.  This case does not require
elaborate procedures and can be implemented using the regular MSC Nastran procedures.  The only possible
difficulty is in knowing the correct boundary conditions.
When the loads on the structure do not have the same symmetry as the structure itself, the more complex
sequence of operations described earlier must be carried out, and it is here when automatic procedures
become useful, saving you both time and computer costs.
The cyclic symmetry option in MSC Nastran provides a high degree of automation and economy for each
of its three subclasses:  rotational symmetry (ROT), dihedral symmetry (DIH), and axisymmetry (AXI).
The cyclic symmetry option can be used in several solutions; however, only static analysis using SOL 114 is
discussed in this Guide.Table 16-1  Types of Symmetry

Mathematical Description of Structural Symmetry
Further discussion of symmetry as applied to structural analysis requires the introduction and manipulation
of mathematical symbols.  The treatment in this section is limited to those mathematical aspects that are
necessary for an understanding of the input and output for cyclic symmetry and its subclasses as applied in
MSC Nastran.
Reflective Symmetry
A structure is said to have reflective symmetry with respect to a yz plane if each of its relevant physical
properties Q (such as mass density and elastic modulus) satisfies the equation
(16-1)
or in other words, if the physical properties are identical at the image points on the two sides of the yz plane.&lt;br&gt;
The plane of symmetry divides the structure into two halves that are arbitrarily called the right half and the
left half.  The right half is also called the fundamental region  because, in analysis, it is the half for which a
finite element model is prepared, whereas the finite element model for the left half is only implied.
The physical properties included in Q do not include the loads applied to the structure or its responses
(displacements, internal forces, or stresses).  Let the symbols , and  represent the values of some
particular response u at some point in the right half and at its image point in the left half of the structure.&lt;br&gt;
and  do not necessarily satisfy the reflective symmetry property Equation (16-1), but their average&lt;br&gt;
clearly does.  Thus,
(16-2)
so that
(16-3)
and
(16-4)
Since the right-hand sides of Equation (16-3) and Equation (16-4) are equal, it follows that
(16-5)
The quantity  is called the symmetrical part of the response.  The antisymmetrical part of the response&lt;br&gt;
is defined as one-half of the difference of , and .  Thus,Qxyz Qxyz – =

The antisymmetrical part of the response has the property that
(16-7)
Equation (16-2) and Equation (16-6) show how to obtain the symmetrical and antisymmetrical parts of the
response from the values of the response for the left and right halves of the structure.  They may be written
more compactly in matrix form
(16-8)
The vector&lt;br&gt;
is called the vector of symmetrical components, and the vector&lt;br&gt;
is called the vector of physical components.  The physical components may be found from the symmetrical
components by solving for them from Equation (16-8).
(16-9)
Equation (16-8) and Equation (16-9) apply to any response quantity, and they also apply to the applied loads.&lt;br&gt;

In order to include vectors as well as scalars in u and P, it is necessary to select the coordinate systems  in the
right and left halves to be mirror images of each other as shown in Figure 16-3.  The coordinate system in the
right half is right-handed, to conform with standard MSC Nastran practice.  Note, however, that the
coordinate system in the implied left half is left-handed.  This means, for example, that loads applied
indirectly to the left half, by listing the images of their points of application in the right half, must be
expressed in the particular left-hand coordinate system shown in Figure 16-3.

If the loads applied to a symmetrical structure are symmetrical, the response is symmetrical.  The responses
also include the displacements in the plane of symmetry, i.e., u, v, w, , , and  at x = 0.  Since the
positive directions of u, , and  are opposite in the two halves, continuity requires that they be zero at
x = 0 in a symmetrical solution.  Thus, u = 0,  = 0, and  = 0 are boundary conditions that can be
applied with SPCs if only the right half is represented by a finite element model.  The boundary conditions&lt;br&gt;
for v, w, and  are natural, i.e., their reaction forces in the plane of symmetry are zero by symmetry, and
they may be left unconstrained.
In like manner, if the loads applied to the structure are antisymmetrical, the response is antisymmetrical.  By
similar reasoning it can be shown that the antisymmetrical boundary conditions for a finite element model
of the right half are v = w =  = 0.
If the applied loads are neither symmetrical nor antisymmetrical, the response may be obtained by the
following procedure (which is valid only if the response is a linear function of the applied loads):
1.Compute the symmetrical and antisymmetrical load sets  and  by means of Equation (16-10).
2.Apply  to a finite element model of the right-hand side with symmetric boundary conditions.  The
response  is obtained.
3.Apply  to a finite element model of the right-hand side with antisymmetric boundary conditions.&lt;br&gt;
The response  is obtained.
4.Find the physical responses  and  by means of Equation (16-9).
Everything that has been said about one plane of symmetry can be extended to two or three orthogonal planes
of symmetry.  The steps that were outlined are performed automatically in MSC Nastran’s cyclic symmetry
capability, using the identity between reflective symmetry with one or two planes of symmetry and dihedral
symmetry with one or two segments, respectively.  The steps may also be performed using basic MSC Nastran
procedures but with considerable nonautomated work (see the example in Modeling Guidelines  (Ch. 9)).
Axisymmetry
A structure is said to be axisymmetric  if each of its relevant physical properties Q (such as mass density and
elastic modulus) satisfies the equation
(16-11)
where r, , and z are the components of position in a cylindrical coordinate system.  The cross section for
= 0 is the fundamental region whose properties are mapped into the entire structure by Equation (16-11).xyz

Fourier series are often used in the analysis of axisymmetric structures.  The first step is to find the harmonic
load coefficients from Equation (16-15).  The next step is to find the harmonic response coefficients as
functions of the harmonic load coefficients.  It can be shown from a consideration of the properties of
trigonometric functions that, in linear analysis,
depends only on
that the harmonic response coefficients for a particular harmonic
and
depend only on the harmonic load coefficients
and
for the same harmonic index k. Computational effort can be further reduced by noting that higher harmonics
where is problem dependent do not contribute significantly to the solution and need not be computed.  Once
the harmonic response coefficients are found, the physical components can be computed by means of Equation
(16-12).
Rotational Symmetry
A structure is said to have rotational symmetry if each of its relevant physical properties Q repeats at even
angular intervals around an axis A.  Thus, referring to the structure shown in Figure 16-4,P0 1

Figure 16-4  Conforming Boundaries for the ROT Option
You can apply rotational symmetry by using the following procedure:
1.Model one segment.
2.Make sure each segment has its own coordinate system that rotates with the segment.
3.Segment boundaries may be curved surfaces.  The local displacement coordinate system must
conform at the joining points.  Specify a paired list of points on side 1 and side 2 that are to be joined.
For the purpose of finite element analysis, the structure is divided into N identical segments. The boundaries
between segments may be arbitrarily curved surfaces.  A finite element model is constructed for the first
segment, which is called the fundamental region.=  and n = 1, 2, 3, &amp;hellip;, N.Qn+ Q =

Let the response of the structure (i.e., a displacement, internal force, or stress) at some point p in the n-th
segment be represented by the symbol .  The response  can be expanded into a Fourier series
in the same manner as was done for an axisymmetric structure except that the number of terms in the series
is finite rather than infinite.  The particular form of the Fourier series used in MSC Nastran is

The coefficients
, , and&lt;br&gt;
are symmetrical component sets that may be used instead of , n = 1, 2, &amp;hellip;, N in a subsequent analysis.
The last term is present only if the number of segments N is an even number.  is the largest integer less
than N/2.  The total number of symmetrical component sets is exactly equal to N, whether N is odd or even.&lt;br&gt;
Thus, considering  to be a physical degree of freedom in segment n, you can see that the total number
of degrees of freedom in the symmetrical component sets is exactly equal to the number of physical degrees
of freedom in the structure.  As a result of this fact, it can be shown that the analysis of the finite element
model using the symmetrical components is exact, even though there are only a finite number of terms in
the Fourier series.
If the number of segments is large, the higher harmonics may contribute very little to the total solution.  In
MSC Nastran you have the option to select the harmonics (values of k) to be used in the analysis.
The symmetrical components are evaluated from the physical components by means of the following
summations that replace the Fourier integrals used in axisymmetric analysis.  The argument ( p) is dropped
for convenience.

You should note that stiffness damping, and mass matrices become uncoupled for .
Equation (16-18) also applies to the expansion of applied loads into symmetrical component sets.  Thus
(16-19)
The harmonic index k plays an important role in the analysis of structures with rotational symmetry or in
any other form of cyclic symmetry.  The harmonic index k has the values k= 1, 2, &amp;hellip;, N/2.  lt can be shown
that, if the only nonzero symmetrical load components are for a particular value of k, then the only nonzero
symmetrical response components are for the same value of k, provided only that the structure is linear and
satisfies Equation (16-16).  This fact leads directly to an efficient method of analysis in which each symmetric
load component is computed from Equation (16-19) and applied to a finite element model that is very much
smaller than the complete structure.
The implied coordinate systems  in the physical segments remain fixed in the segments and are rotated with
them.  In order to satisfy continuity between segments, the grid point on side 2 of segment 1 must coincide
with the grid point on side 1 of segment 2 and their coordinate systems must be aligned (see Figure 16-4).  As
a result, you must take care to align the grid points on sides 1 and 2 of the fundamental region so that their
positions and displacement coordinate systems differ only by a rotation through the angle&lt;br&gt;
about the axis of symmetry.  This is most easily satisfied by using a cylindrical coordinate system for the grid
points on sides 1 and 2.  If this is done, the boundary conditions are satisfied by imposing the following
constraints on the symmetrical components of displacement at corresponding points on sides 1 and 2
(indicated by subscripts).uk

Since N = 2, there are two symmetrical component sets  and .  The symmetrical load
components, as computed from Equation (16-19), are
(16-21)
and  are applied to separate copies of the finite element model for the fundamental region labeled
the K = 0 model and the K = 1 model.  The boundary condition linking all six degrees of freedom at
corresponding pairs of grid points on sides 1 and 2, as computed from Equation (16-20), are
(16-22)
These boundary conditions can be supplied in Solution 101 with multipoint constraints; however, they are
provided automatically in MSC Nastran’s cyclic symmetry capability.
The K = 0 and K = 1 models are solved in the usual way to obtain the symmetrical response components
and
As a final step, the physical responses are evaluated as follows from Equation (16-17)
(16-23)
The static condensation procedure described in Matrix Operations , 467 can be used to advantage in the sample
problem that was just described.  With this procedure all of the interior degrees of freedom are placed in the
set and eliminated, resulting in a greatly reduced stiffness matrix for the remaining degrees of freedom
on the boundary (sides 1 and 2).  The advantage of this procedure is that, since it needs to be done only once,
there is a net saving of computer time.
Dihedral Symmetry
Dihedral symmetry is a special case of rotational symmetry in which each segment has an internal plane of
reflective symmetry as illustrated in Figure 16-6.  The fundamental region, for which a finite element model
is prepared, is the right half of the first segment.  The plane that forms the boundary between the right and
left halves of segment 1 is labeled side 2.  The other boundary of the fundamental region, which must also
be planar in dihedral symmetry, is labeled side 1. You must give separate lists for the degrees of freedom on
sides 1 and 2.  The displacement coordinate systems on the boundaries must be aligned parallel and
perpendicular to the boundaries.u0uN2u1=

Figure 16-6  Dihedral Symmetry
The typical procedure that you follow when using dihedral symmetry is as follows:
1.You model one half-segment (1R).
2.At a boundary between segments or half-segments, the displacement components must be parallel and
perpendicular to the boundary.  The boundaries are planes passing through the axis of symmetry.
3.You provide separate lists of the points on side 1 and side 2.
The implied coordinate system for segment 1L is the mirror image of that for segment 1R, the fundamental
region.  This fact has important implications for the input of loads data and the interpretation of output.&lt;br&gt;
The coordinate systems for other half-segments in Figure 16-6 are either rotated, or rotated and reflected as

Returning to our truss example, the members of the truss are modeled using rod elements.  The
MSC Nastran notation for a rod is the CROD  Bulk Data entry.  The “C” preceding ROD denotes that the
entry is for an “element connection”, i.e., it connects grid points.  This pattern is true for all elements, for
example, the Bulk Data entry notation for a element connection of a QUAD4 plate element is CQUAD4 .&lt;br&gt;
This notation also makes it convenient when trying to find a description of a particular element in the MSC
Nastran Quick Reference Guide  since they are all ordered alphabetically under the C’s.Grid Entries

Overview of the MSC Nastran Output Files38
Main Index
All elements in the input file must have a unique ID with respect to all the other elements.  The IDs of the
CROD elements in the truss example are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
Each of the CROD entries refers to the PROD  entry 21 (Field 3), which is the property definition of the
CROD elements.  The PROD entry specifies a material ID of 22 (field 3), the cross-sectional area of 4.0 in2,
and the torsional stiffness coefficient of 1.27 in4.  All property entries begin with “P”.
The material ID of 22 refers to a MAT1  entry.  The MAT1 entry defines an isotropic material.  The MAT1
entry is defined formally in Material Properties and Composites ; but for now, it is sufficient to say that an isotropic
material requires only two constants to fully describe the material.  In this case the material property is
described as having a Young’s modulus of 30 x 106 psi and a Poisson’s ratio of 0.3.  All material entries start
with “M”.
The FORCE and SPC entries, as mentioned previously, are included in the analysis because they were called
out in the Case Control Section  by their ID number.  The FORCE entry in this example specifies a point
load of 1000 pounds acting at grid point 4 in the -Y direction.  The SPC1 entry specifies that all six degrees
of freedom are constrained at grid points 1 and 2.
If you have not performed an MSC Nastran run before, you are encouraged to copy the truss model
“truss1.dat” into your working directory and submit it as an MSC Nastran job. See
MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/truss1.dat.
Overview of the MSC Nastran Output Files
The purpose of this section is to introduce the output file generated by a typical run. If you are new to MSC
Nastran, this section may seem somewhat overwhelming. Like the previous section, however, this section is
only meant to provide an overview-the details are covered in the remaining sections and chapters.
After an input file is submitted for execution, several output files may be generated. Table 2-1 provides
summary descriptions of all the potential files generated by MSC Nastran (assuming the input file is named
run1.dat ). The output files that are generated depend on your input file requests and the command line
options that you specify when the job is submitted.  Some of the files shown will not be generated, and some
will be generated and deleted automatically once the job is complete.

Main Index
The main output is located in the .f06 file and the .f04 and .log files are useful for debugging your model
should problems occur. Many of the .f06 output formats are shown in the Sample Output Listings  (App. A) with
notes, so it is a good referenced for understanding your output requests.
In reference to the files run1.dat , run1.f06 , run1.f04 , run1.log , and run1.pch are ASCII  files and can be
viewed using any text editor.  The remaining files are binary and therefore cannot be viewed.  The binary
files are not intended to be used directly; they are to be used for additional analysis, such as restarts or
postprocessing.  If no restarts are planned for the job run1, you can delete run1.DBALL and can
run1.MASTER to save disk space.
The file run1.plt is a binary file that contains the plotting information generated by the MSC Nastran plotter.&lt;br&gt;
If the MSC Nastran plotter is not used, run1.plt is deleted following the completion of the run.  Likewise,
if punch output is specified, the file run1.pch is retained after the run is complete; otherwise, it is deleted
once the run is complete.  The binary file run1.op2 is the graphics database used by Patran graphics pre- and
postprocessors.  It is requested by a PARAM,POST entry in the Bulk Data Section. The binary file run1.h5
is the results database in HDF5 format that is requested using the MDLPRM, HDF5,1 bulk data entry.
If no restarts are planned, you may specify “scr = yes” on the command line when submitting the input file
for execution.  The .DBALL  and .MASTER  files are placed on the scratch directory and are automatically
deleted upon completion of the run.  The command line options are discussed in Database Management , and
Reference 18.
For the five-member truss, the input file name is truss1.dat.  The resulting output files are truss1.f06,
truss1.f04, truss1.log, truss1.DBALL, and truss1.MASTER.
If the file truss1.dat is submitted a second time as a cold start (i.e., no restart commands are used), you might
want to delete the files .DBALL and .MASTER before the run is submitted the second time.  Also, if an .op2
file already exists for the run, it too should be deleted prior to resubmitting the run. Without deleting, these
files are reused and can increase in size or have multiple copies created.run1.MASTER The file containing the master directory of the files used by the run and the
physical location of the files on the system.  This file is also needed for a restart
run.
run1.IFPDAT The file containing the Bulk Data entries for IFPStar restart processing
(SYSTEM(444)=1)
run1.plt Contains the plot information requested by the NASTRAN plotter commands
specified in input file.

The output file that you will use most frequently is the .f06 file; therefore, it is useful to discuss a typical one
before discussing the details of the input file.  A complete listing of the truss1.f06 output file (minus the page
numbers and date) is shown in Figure 2-3.  This is one of the few occasions that an output file is shown in its
entirety; only selected portions of the output will be shown in the remaining examples in this user’s guide.&lt;br&gt;
The .f06 suffix is used because the program is writing this file to FORTRAN unit 6 (this piece of trivia makes
no difference regarding how you use MSC Nastran, but many users are curious about where the names come
from).
By default, the output file contains an echo (listing) of the input file with the Bulk Data sorted alphabetically
as shown in Figure 2-3.&lt;/p&gt;

Figure 2-3  truss1.f06 Output File.
After the input file echo, the “OLOAD RESULTANT ” is printed which shows the resultant of the loads
about the origin of the basic coordinate system in this case.  Next is the USER INFORMATION MESSAGE
(UIM) 5293 which shows the epsilon  and external work  for the run.  The epsilon is a measure of the numeric
conditioning of the model, while the external work is the work due to the applied loads.  Both of these values
are useful for model checkout and are discussed in more detail in Model Verification .
In the truss example, output is requested for displacements, element forces, and element stresses.  The
displacement request is the only grid point output.  Element forces and stresses are element output.  The last
summary is the maximum of the applied loads.  After the summaries, the displacement for all of the grid
points, the element forces, and the element stresses is printed as requested in the Case Control Section.
For static analysis of the truss model, just one applied load is used.  You can, however, specify multiple loading
conditions to be analyzed in a single input file if desired.  If you do specify multiple loading conditions, the
OLOAD RESULTANT and EXTERNAL WORK are shown for each selected loading conditions.  The
external work is calculated as 1/2{Pl}T[Ul].  In the case of enforced displacement, the equivalent load is
calculated as the constraint force required to impose the enforced displacement.  The external work print-out
in this case is meaningless.
The information in the output file is extremely important for model checkout and debugging.  Make a habit
of reviewing these diagnostics for all of your runs.  Experiment with the truss1.dat file; run the input file and
view truss1.f06 in your text editor.
After this overview of the MSC Nastran input and output files, the next three sections contain the Executive
Control Section, Case Control Section, and Bulk Data Section.  The File Management Section is discussed
in Database Management .
The Executive Control Section
The purpose of the Executive Control Section  is to select the solution sequence for the desired analysis,
specify the maximum CPU time allowed for the job, and request various diagnostics.  Also, it is the location
for alters and user-written DMAP (i.e., Direct Matrix Abstraction Program, a matrix manipulation language
used to modify the normal solution processing).  Most of the commonly used statements are order
independent.  The statements for which the order is critical are those used for user DMAP and alters and the
CEND statement.  User DMAP and alters are advanced topics and are normally not used for most analyses.
The Executive Control statements that are commonly used for linear static analysis are described in Table 2-2.Note:   The file is 132 columns wide&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;43 CHAPTER 2
Organization of MSC Nastran Files
Main Index
The format of the Executive Control statements is free-field format between columns 1-72.  The statements
may begin in any column (except for comments).  The operands&amp;ndash;that is, the input data following the name-
-are separated from the name using a comma and/or one or more blanks.  If more than one operand is
needed, they are also separated by a comma and/or one or more blanks.
Comments may be placed anywhere in the input file and are denoted by placing a “$ ” at the start of the
comment.  If an input line is to be a comment only, it must start in column 1.  Comments are ignored by
MSC Nastran and have no affect on the results.  You should use comments generously;  they greatly improve
the readability of the input file.
The ID statement can be used to help identify a job; this statement is optional.
The SOL statement specifies the desired solution sequence to be used.  T o invoke a particular analysis type,
the SOL name is followed by the ID number or name of the solution sequence.  Linear static analysis&amp;ndash;the
main subject of this guide&amp;ndash;is the Solution Sequence, SOL 101 or SOL SESTATIC. The Solution Sequences
are numbered in the range of 101 through 400.  Linear static analysis can also be selected with the SOL 400
statement and the addition of the Case Control command ANALYSIS=STATICS. For this guide the
examples will use SOL 101.
The ECHOON  and ECHOOFF  statements are used to control the printing of the Executive Control
Section.  Since the Executive Control Section is generally quite small, it is recommended that it be echoed
(the default choice).  If the Executive Control is not printed, readability is hindered, especially if you have to
come back to the output file several months after the original run was made.  Since ECHOON is the default,
this statement is not widely used.  However, one useful application for the ECHOOFF statement is security.&lt;br&gt;
By using ECHOOFF , portions of the Executive Control Section that you may consider proprietary (such as
user-written DMAP) may be eliminated from the output file.  Multiple ECHOON and ECHOOFF
statements may be used.
The TIME  statement is optional for most MSC Nastran runs.  The purpose of the TIME statement is to set
the maximum CPU time that MSC Nastran runs before the job is terminated.  This value should not to be
confused with a system time limit imposed by the system administrator.  It is a good practice to set the MSC
Nastran time limit to a value less than the system time limit.
If the system time limit is exceeded during execution, the system aborts the job, which can potentially corrupt
the database.  Once the database is corrupted, it is difficult, if not impossible, to restart the job to take
advantage of the work done up to the point of the abort.  On the other hand, if the required execution time Table 2-2  Commonly Used Executive Control Statements
CEND Designates the end of the Executive Control Section.
DIAG Requests diagnostic output or modifies operational parameters.
ECHOON
ECHOOFFControls the echo of the Executive Control statements.
ID Optional identifier.
SOL Requests the solution to be performed.
TIME Sets the maximum allowable execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Linear Statics Analysis User’s Guide
The Case Control Section44
Main Index
exceeds the time specified on the MSC Nastran TIME statement, the job terminates cleanly and permits
restarts if desired.  Also, MSC Nastran estimates the CPU time required to perform certain operations during
execution.  If the time remaining is not sufficient to complete a particular operation, the job terminates
without wasting any additional computer resources.  The default value for TIME is infinity.
The statement DIAG in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide  is used to request additional diagnostics or
output and/or to modify the solution.
The Executive Control Section for the truss example ( Listing 2-1) identifies the job, requests the static
Structured Solution Sequence 101, and sets the maximum time limit for the job to two minutes.  For more
details, see Executive Control Statement Descriptions  in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide .
The Case Control Section
The Case Control Section  is used to document the run, make selections from the Bulk Data Section, request
output, and define subcase structure.  Subcase structure provides the means to perform an analysis with
different combinations of loads and boundary conditions within a single run.  To denote a subcase, the
SUBCASE (Case)  command is used together with an ID operand that identifies the subcase number.  Requests
may be made above the first subcase or within any of the subcases. Those requests made above the first subcase
are the defaults for all of the subcases. These defaults apply to all of the subcases unless they are specifically
overridden within the subcase. If a SUBCASE command is not present in the Case Control Section, as is the
case for the truss example described in Overview of the MSC Nastran Input File , a single subcase with ID 1 is
assumed.
Figure 2-4  Truss Example with Two Loading Conditions.
As an example, a second load case is added to the previous truss structure as shown in Figure 2-4.  The two
separate analyses are performed during a single run.  The first subcase consists of the 1000-pound force acting
at grid point 4 in the negative Y-direction.  The second subcase consists of the 2000-pound force acting at
grid point 3 in the X-direction.  The displacements are requested for all the grid points for both load cases,
but only the element forces are desired for the second load case.4Y

The Case Control Section consists of two subcases identified with ID numbers 1 and 2.  The choice of the
ID numbers is arbitrary, but they must be strictly in ascending order.  For example, if the first subcase is 10,
the ID number of the second subcase can be any integer number greater than 10.
Any title information, output requests, or Bulk Data selections made prior to the first subcase are the defaults
for all the subcases unless they are overridden by a request within a specific subcase.  For the Case Control
Section shown in Listing 2-2, a displacement request is placed above the first subcase but not within either of
the two subcases.  Therefore, the displacements are output for all of the grid points for both subcases.  Since
an element force request appears only in Subcase 2, no element force output is generated for Subcase 1.  The
element forces are output for all elements for the loading condition defined in Subcase 2.
It is often desirable to limit the output to a select number of grid points or elements; this is accomplished
with the use of the SET  command.  The SET (Case)  command identifies a group of grid points and/or elements
as a specific set ID.  For example, suppose you want to output all of the grid point displacements for Subcase
1 and the grid point displacements for grid points 3 and 4 for Subcase 2.  In addition, you want the element
force output for element 3 for Subcase 1 and elements 3 and 4 for Subcase 2.  A Case Control Section that
meets these requirements is shown in Listing 2-3.

For large models, you may need to further partition the results in the output files in a certain manner or repeat
the same output in different subcases.  The REPCASE  command is designed for this purpose.  The
REPCASE command provides a method of organizing the output based on the element and/or grid point ID
numbers, which is convenient for large models or when more than one engineer is reviewing the results.
As an example, again consider the truss example shown in Listing 2-2.  Suppose you want to separate the results
into three separate sections in the .f06 output file.  The case control input file is shown in Listing 2-4.  (See
MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/truss4.dat.) In this example, the Repcase 2 command provides for additional
output from the solution generated in Subcase 1 without performing any additional analysis.  For the Case
Control shown in Listing 2-4, Subcase 1 output consists of the displacement for all of the grid points and the
element forces for elements 1 and 2.  The output for Repcase 2 consists of the element force for elements 3
through 5.  Note that the default output request for the grid point displacements is overridden by the
DISPLACEMENT = NONE command.  Subcase 3 is a new loading condition with its own output requests.&lt;br&gt;
A second static solution is performed for this subcase.  Also note that only two static solutions are performed
for this input file.

The SUBCOM  command is used to generate linear combinations of the previous subcases.  Returning to the
truss structure shown in Listing 2-2, the two load cases were previously treated as separate loads, each with their
own subcase.  Now, suppose a third load case is desired that is a linear combination of the first two subcases.&lt;br&gt;
The case control input file shown in Listing 2-5 demonstrates this feature.

For the Case Control input file shown in Listing 2-5, the SUBCOM 3 output is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Linear Statics Analysis User’s Guide
The Case Control Section48
Main Index
The output for SUBCOM 4 is as follows:
The coefficients 1.0, and 0.5 for Subcom 3 are input on a SUBSEQ  or SUBSEQ1 command.  These
coefficients used in the SUBSEQ or SUBSEQ1 command refer to the previous Subcases 1 and 2.  The 1.0
value in Subcom 3 is the coefficient corresponding to Subcase 1 and the 0.5 is the coefficient associated with
Subcase 2.  Subcom 3 is not considered a subcase.  Likewise, the coefficients 1.0 and -0.5 for Subcom 4 refer
to Subcases 1 and 2.  If you specify a third SUBSEQ coefficient for either subcom, the job will fail.
SUBCOM  commands may be used to combine any number of previous subcases; however, there must be a
coefficient defined on the SUBSEQ command for each subcase.  If you wish to exclude a subcase from the
summation, set the coefficient to 0.0 for that particular subcase.
The alternative is to use the SUBSEQ1 command which is easier to use, especially if one has a large number
of subcases. In which case, you only need to enter the SUBCASE ID and the factor.
As a final note, you can define the combined loads in their own subcases and not use subcoms.  If your goal
is only to generate the output of the the combined loads (so you only need two subcases), this is the preferred
way.  However, using subcoms is desirable if you want to review the structural response to the individual loads
in addition to the combined load.  The SUBCOM command sums up the results of the previous subcases
multiplied by the appropriate scale factors.  One of the best applications of the SUBCOM command is
combining the results generated with different constraints.
The ECHO (Case)  command in the Case Control Section is used to control the printing of the Bulk Data
Section.  There are five options for this command:
For example, to echo the Bulk Data in the unsorted form, you use the following ECHO command:
ECHO = UNSORT
The output requests, such as DISPLACEMENT , FORCE , STRESS , etc., are needed whenever data recovery
quantities are to be computed, even if they are not printed.  Such is the case when you use a postprocessor to
view the results.  Typical output requests are as follows:SORT Prints the Bulk Data Section in sorted form; free-field format is converted to small-field
format and is sorted alphabetically.  This is the default.
UNSORT Prints the Bulk Data Section exactly as it is input.
BOTH Prints the Bulk Data Section in the sorted and unsorted format.
PUNCH Punches the Bulk Data to an ASCII file.
NONE Suppresses printing of the Bulk Data.SUBCOM 3

The PLOT option suppresses the printed output, but the data recovery is still performed.  This option is
useful for large models where the quantity of printed output would be excessive, but the data recovery is still
required for postprocessing.  The PUNCH option writes the results to an ASCII file instead of the .f06 file.&lt;br&gt;
This option makes it convenient for exporting the results to other programs.
POST Case Control Command
The POST (Case)  Case Control command provides some subcase-level control over the amount of output data
stored on the postprocessing file.
Finite element analysis of large structural components often have many different loading scenarios in the
simulation, possibly with several thousand different load cases.  During this process, recovery and
postprocessing of large amounts of response data usually occurs.  Many analysis organizations use
commercially available pre and postprocessors such as Patran to graphically display results data.  These
programs typically read the results data from a FORTRAN file generated by the OUTPUT2 module in MSC
Nastran.  This file, by default, contains all of the output requested by the case control data recovery requests
in each and every subcase.  The POST Command can eliminate the output data for a particular subcase from
the data file that is not needed by the postprocessor.
The results output from large simulations can quickly consume enormous amounts of computer disk storage
space. Not only does MSC Nastran store the output for use by the postprocessing program, the postprocessor
itself can use large quantities of disk space when it creates different views of the data for use in a graphical
display environment. If the postprocessor program does not require results from one (or more) subcase(s),
both computer time and disk space are wasted reading and storing the unnecessary data. Use of the POST
Case Control command can be used to eliminate the unwanted results data from the OUTPUT2 file. This
can substantially reduce the file processing time and disk space used by the postprocessor.
Another benefit of the POST Case Control command is that it allows MSC Nastran to write data into output
files by specifying their file names instead of FORTRAN unit reference numbers. This capability removes
the limitation imposed by the MSC Nastran file management system on the number of ASSIGN
statements.The user is now able to write solution data into as many output files, as desired.
The amount of data recovered for each subcase is dependent upon the Case Control commands.  If a request
is placed above all subcases, that request applies to all of the subcases. Data are generated and produced one
time for all subcases by examining the case control requests in each subcase. Each separate type of response
is stored in its own data block.  For example, displacement results are computed and stored separately from
element stress results. These data blocks will include results for any subcase that contains a data recovery
request with a print, plot or punch destination.  The data blocks are then written to an external file by the
OUTPUT2 module, unless the POST Command is used to eliminate specific Data requests.
The POST Case Control command provides control over the contents of the output file produced by the
MSC Nastran program when a PARAM, POST Bulk Data entry is present in the input.  It does not affect the SET 1 = 5, 6, 7

contents of the results data blocks, only the amount of data that is transferred from those data blocks to the
output file. The POST command is examined for the output requested in each subcase.  Only that output
requested by the POST command is placed on the output file for the subcase.  Note that the data must be
made available by the presence of a data recovery command in the subcase.  For example, the POST
command cannot output stress data if no stress data have been requested.
The general format of the POST command is:
Example
This sample shows the usage of the POST Case Control command to eliminate unwanted output from being
placed on the postprocessor data file generated by MSC Nastran.  The model data is not important for this
example. For example, consider the case of a static simulation performed on a model requiring three load
cases.  The required output is displacements at three grid points in the model.  Furthermore, the output for
the second load case must also include punched displacement data for all grid points.  Displacement results
for subcases 100 and 300 are to be placed on the default OUTPUT2 file for use by the Patran postprocessor.&lt;br&gt;
No output for subcase 200 is required for postprocessing by Patran.  The subcase structure might look
something like:
SET 1000  =  10, 11, 12
DISP = 1000
$
POSTTOFILE 12 $ use defaults: Patran
$
SUBCASE 100
LOAD = 100
$
SUBCASE 200
LOAD = 200
DISP(PUNCH) = ALL
POST  NODISP  $  stop any displacement output from going to POST file
$
SUBCASE 300
LOAD = 300
In this example, the presence of the POST command above all of the subcases indicates that all output
requested (DISP for SET 1000 is the only output requested and generated) is to be stored on the default
OUTPUT2 fortran unit for use by Patran.  The POST command in SUBCASE 200 with the NODISP
option prevents the large output produced by the DISP(PUNCH)=ALL request in SUBCASE 200 from
being placed on the OUTPUT2 file.
A complete description of all of the Case Control commands is available in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference
Guide . See the Case Control Applicability Tables  in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide  for commands used in

The Bulk Data Section
The Bulk Data Section  is the primary method of describing the structural model and is usually the majority
of the input file.  The order of Bulk Data entries is not critical (continuations without continuation
identifiers are an exception to this rule and are discussed later). All of the Bulk Data entries are sorted
alphabetically prior to the start of execution and are printed in the sorted order by default. For very large
problems, this sorting process can be CPU intensive. If you anticipate that the same input file will be
submitted several times, it is advantageous to sort the Bulk Data once and use the sorted input file. A sorted
Bulk Data file can be generated using the ECHO = PUNCH  command in the Case Control Section (note:
comments in the Bulk Data Section are lost). Alternatively, the sorted Bulk Data is stored on the database
and is available using the Restart feature. Restarts are discussed in Restarts, 529 .
Bulk Data entries may be entered in three different formats:  small-field, large-field, and free-field. For the
small-field format, it is convenient to visualize each input line consisting of 80 columns. The 80 columns are
divided into 10 fields with each field being 8 columns wide as shown in Figure 2-5.
Figure 2-5  Small-Field Format
The name of the Bulk Data entry is entered in field 1 beginning in column 1.  Fields 2 through 9 are used
for data input.  The only limitation is that the data within these fields must lie completely within the field,
have no embedded blanks, and must be of the proper type.  There are three distinct types of input used for
Bulk Data entries:  real, integer, and character; in general, they are not interchangeable.  If a particular field
requires an integer, such as an ID number on the GRID  entry, entering a real number causes a fatal error.&lt;br&gt;
Field 10 of the Bulk Data entry is used for two purposes.  If the Bulk Data entry does not have a continuation
line, Field 10 may be used as an optional comment field.  If the Bulk Data entry has a continuation line, field
10 is used for the continuation identifier.  The continuation identifier must be unique with respect to all the
other identifiers in your Bulk Data Section.
Real numbers may be entered in various ways; however, the number must contain a decimal point.  For
example, the real number 7.0 may be entered as 7., 7.0, 7.E0, .7E+1, 700.E-2, etc.  Integer numbers do not
have decimal points.  Character  input consists of one to eight alphanumeric characters, the first of which
must be alphabetic.
A blank may be used in many of the data fields, in which case the appropriate default is used.  The defaults
for data fields, if they are applicable to a particular field, are described in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide .&lt;br&gt;
There are certain situations that allow either an integer or a real number in a data field.  In these situations,
the choice of an integer or a real number in these data fields affects the problem solution.  Fortunately, there
are only a few such situations, and they are discussed in the appropriate sections of this user’s guide.
Consider the definition for grid point 2 of the truss model shown in Figure 2-6.  The name of the entry is
GRID, which begins in column 1 of field 1.  The grid point ID (2 in this case) must be an integer (no decimal
point) greater than 0.  Fields 3 and 7 represent coordinate system IDs and also must be integers.  Since these 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

The Bulk Data Section52
Main Index
fields are blank, the default of 0 is used.  Fields 4, 5, and 6 represent the physical location of the grid point,
and they must be entered as real numbers.  Optional fields are field 8, which is used to define permanently
constrained degrees of freedom, and field 9, the superelement ID field.  If they are used, only integers are
acceptable.  Since the GRID entry does not have a continuation line, field 10 may be used as a comment, if
desired.
Figure 2-6  A Bulk Data Example:  the GRID Entry
If a Bulk Data entry requires more than eight data fields, continuation lines  must be used.  When a
continuation line is used, field 10 contains the continuation identifier  that must be unique with respect to
all other continuation identifiers.  Column 1 of field 10 is always ignored and is not considered part of the
identifer.  The small field continuation line is denoted by a + symbol in column 1 of field 1.  The
continuation line is matched to its parent entry by the identifier in columns 2 through 8 of Field 1.  An
example is shown in Figure 2-7.
Figure 2-7  Small-Field Entry with Continuation Lines
The identifiers used in Figure 2-7 are arbitrary.  The only restriction is that the alphanumeric character strings
used as the continuation identifiers do not contain the symbols *, =, or $.  The + symbol used in column 1
of field 10 is for clarity.
It is often more convenient to let MSC Nastran generate the continuation identifiers automatically.  To do
this, leave both field 10 of the parent entry and field 1 of the continuation line blank, and place the
continuation line directly following the parent entry.  The blank field indicates that it is a small-field
continuation of the previous line.  The advantage of using continuation identifiers is that the input file may
be unsorted, that is, the continuation lines do not have to follow the parent line.  However, this benefit is
generally not worth the inconvenience of using the continuation identifiers.
The most common form of input when generating the Bulk Data entries manually is the free-field format.&lt;br&gt;
In the free-field format, commas are used to separate the fields (blank spaces are also acceptable, but not
recommended).  An entry using the free-field format is identified by a comma or an equal sign in any of the
first eight columns of the entry.  Internally, the free-field format is converted to small-field format, so the same
rules apply to free-field format entries as for the small-field format entries.  Integers and character entries must
be eight characters or less, and real numbers longer than eight characters are rounded to eight characters.&lt;br&gt;
Free-field format entries must start in column 1.  If automatic continuation is to be used, the continuation
line starts with a comma in field 1, indicating that the first field is blank. As long as less than 80 columns are
used, the free field format can have more than 8 data fields and connections will be automatic.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

You may find it necessary to input integers larger than eight characters or real numbers with more significant
digits than can be placed in an eight-character field.  In such cases, a large-field format option is available.&lt;br&gt;
With large-field format, as shown in Figure 2-8, Fields 2 through 9 are 16 characters in length and generally
require two lines instead of one.
Figure 2-8  Large-Field Input Format
The large-field format entry is identified by the * symbol after the entry name. The large-field format
continuation is denoted by the * symbol in column 1.
It is possible to mix small-field and large-field format continuations; however, it is generally not
recommended because it becomes difficult to discern the locations of the fields. There is no automatic
continuation feature for the large-field format. If the large-field format is used, the continuation identifiers
must be used.
Figure 2-9 shows a CORD2R entry using the three different formats. Knowledge of the CORD2R entry is
not necessary for this example except to note that this entry requires a continuation line. Coordinate systems
are discussed in Grid Points, Scalar Points, and Coordinate Systems .1a 2 3 4 5 10a

Figure 2-9  Input Format Example
In the examples shown in Figure 2-9, column 1 of field 10 contains a + symbol for the small-field format and
a * symbol for the large-field format. Since this column is ignored, the choice of the + and the * is arbitrary;
however, these choices do improve readability because they serve as a reminder for the format of the
continuation line. This convention is commonly used in the MSC Nastran user community.
The majority of Bulk Data entries are shown in small-field or large-field format throughout this user’s guide

Introduction to Degrees of Freedom
When you create a finite element model  of a structure, you are creating a mathematical model representing
your structure in matrix form.  The unknowns in the matrix equation are the displacements in the model.&lt;br&gt;
These displacements consist of the six components for each of the grid points  and one component for each
of the scalar points.  In general, the displacements at the grid points and the scalar points are referred to as
the degrees of freedom of the model.
A scalar point is similar to a grid point in the way that it is assembled into the matrix equation.  However, a
scalar point  has no spatial orientation; it is simply an additional degree of freedom that you can define in your
model.  Scalar points are useful for modeling with scalar elements, multipoint constraints (MPCs), CBEAM
warping, and other applications.
This chapter describes both grid points and scalar points. Section  is devoted to the several types of coordinate
systems available in MSC Nastran.
Grid Points
The Bulk Data entry GRID is used to identify a grid point, specify the location of the grid point in space with
respect to a reference coordinate system, assign permanent constraints, and define the directions of motions
at the grid point.  The format of the grid point  entry is as follows:
GRID
The grid point ID must be unique with respect to all other grid points and scalar points in your model.  The
IDs do not have to be contiguous, and they do have to begin at 1.  You will often find it convenient to use
groups of IDs for a particular section of your model.  For instance, if a model of an automobile is generated,
the door may have grid point IDs, for example, in the range from 1 to 1000.  The grid points used to model
the hood may be in the range from 1001 to 2000, etc.  Use whatever is convenient for clarity in understanding
the results.  The prudent choice of a grid point numbering scheme and the use of the SET  command in the
Case Control Section can help simplify the interpretation of the results, especially when more than one
engineer is involved in the project.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Cyclic Symmetry
Main Index
As in rotational symmetry, the response quantities at corresponding points in the physical segments can be
expressed as a truncated Fourier series with the polar angle of the n-th segment  as the
argument where N is the number of segments.  The series for response quantities in the right half-segments is
(16-24)
where  is the largest integer less than or equal to N/2 (depending on whether n is odd or even) and
, , , and
are symmetrical component sets.  The series for response quantities in the left half-segments is
(16-25)
where, in addition to previously defined terms, .
The symmetrical component sets are evaluated from the physical components as follows:

(16-27)
where, in addition to previously defined terms,  for  and , and  for all other
values of k.
The number of symmetrical components sets is equal to the number of half-segments in the structure.
As in the case of rotational symmetry, the symmetrical load components for a particular value of k produce
only the symmetrical response components for the same value of k, or, to put it another way, the analyses for
the different values of k are uncoupled.  Furthermore, the analyses for the starred (&lt;em&gt;) and unstarred n2n1–N =

symmetrical components are uncoupled.  For  and , the complete finite element model
for the unstarred terms consists of a single copy of the fundamental region (1 R).  For 0 &amp;lt; k &amp;lt; N/2, the
complete finite element model consists of two copies of the fundamental region with coupling between their
boundaries.  The boundary conditions are different for each value of k.  The finite element models for the
starred (&lt;em&gt;) terms are identical to those for the unstarred terms for k &amp;gt; 0.  Only the symmetrical load
components, which are computed by Equation (16-26) and Equation (16-27), are different.
As an example, consider the case of a structure with two planes of reflective symmetry as shown in Figure 16-2.&lt;br&gt;
Applying dihedral symmetry to this case, you can see that
The number of segments N = 2.
The segment angles a = n.
  = 0.
  =

Cyclic Symmetry
Main Index
It can be seen that regardless of the number of segments, the starred terms are always antisymmetrical, and
the unstarred terms are always symmetrical with respect to side 1 of the fundamental region.  Advantage may
be taken of this fact to reduce the amount of calculation when it can be determined beforehand that the
applied loading has a plane of symmetry or antisymmetry that coincides with side 1 of the fundamental
region, or, in other words, if the problem has an overall plane of symmetry.  The amount of computation can
be reduced still further if the problem has a second overall plane of symmetry perpendicular to the first.  The
second overall plane of symmetry can exist only if there is an even number of segments.

Bulk Data Entries for Cyclic Symmetry578
Main Index
Each of the entries shown in Table 16-4 is discussed below in terms of its general characteristics.  Also,
examples of the use of these entries are provided.
CYJOIN, CYSYM, CYAX, and CYSUP Bulk Data Entries
The boundary points of a segment in cyclic symmetry problems using the CYJOIN  entry are as follows:
CYJOIN
One CYJOIN entry plus all necessary continuation entries are used to specify the GRID and/or scalar points
(SPOINT), on side 1 of the fundamental region.  A second CYJOIN entry plus all necessary continuation
entries are used to specify the GRID and/or scalar points (SPOINT) on side 2 of the fundamental region.  As
will be shown, points that lie on the axis of symmetry appear on a CYAX Bulk Data entry but not on a
CYJOIN entry.
1.For the ROT option, the two CYJOlN lists must be of the same length and, since the boundary
conditions for the fundamental region involve these two lists, it is required that the two lists be
ordered.  That is,  the n-th point on side 1 is related through boundary conditions to the n-th point
of side 2.  Side 2 is  related to side 1 as indicated in Figure 16-4.
Note that displacement compatibility must be maintained at the boundaries.  This requirement
necessitates that the displacement coordinate systems for the boundary points be either cylindrical or
spherical.
2.The AXI option is a subset of the ROT option in which all the grid points in the fundamental region
lie either on side 1 or on side 2.  The rules for the CYJOIN entry are identical for both the ROT and
AXI options of cyclic symmetry.
3.For the DlH option, side 1 denotes the boundary between segments, and side 2 denotes the side that
is contained in the plane of reflective symmetry of the segment. Since the boundary conditions do not
relate sides 1 and 2, it is not necessary that the two lists be of equal length.  It is,  however, necessary
under the DlH option to provide an entry in the third field for the parameter C.  The appropriate
entries are listed in Table 16-5.
It may be deduced that, unlike the ROT option (in which case, one and only one logical CYJOIN entry must
exist for each of side 1 and side 2), any number of CYJOIN entries may be used to define the points on a side
of the fundamental region in the DIH option.  Thus, each point along a boundary may appear on a separate
CYJOIN entry if, for example, each point has a different coordinate system.  In any event, for the DIH 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

option, the displacement coordinate systems associated with boundary points must be oriented so that the
components of motion are normal and parallel to the boundary planes.
Specifies the number of segments NSEG that comprise the total structure and the cyclic symmetry option
STYPE to be used in the analysis.
The format of the CYSYM  entry is as follows:
CYSYM
The polar angle  subtended by the element model for the fundamental region, must be such that =
/NSEG exactly for the ROT and AXI options.  For the DlH option,  must equal /NSEG
exactly if there are any points on side 1.  The polar angle  is smaller in the DlH option because the
fundamental region is the right half of segment 1 in this case.  If there are no points on side 1,  must be
less than or equal to /NSEG in the DIH option because otherwise the segments would overlap.  The
number of segments for the AXI option should be large enough (typically 360 segments) to approximate true
axisymmetry.
The CYAX  Bulk Data entry provides you with the option to have points on the axis of symmetry.
The format of the CYAX entry is as follows:

Special rules, which are enumerated below, are inherently necessary for the existence of points on the line of
axisymmetry.
1.The coordinate system that locates points on the axis of symmetry and the displacement coordinate
system for these points must be rectangular with the z-component aligned with the axis of symmetry.&lt;br&gt;
In addition, if the DlH option is selected, the y-axis must be perpendicular to side 1 of the
fundamental region.
2.Grid points on the axis of symmetry may not appear on a CYJOlN Bulk Data entry.
3.Grid points on the axis of symmetry may not be referenced as dependent points by MPCs and/or rigid
elements.
4.Grid points on the axis of symmetry may have SPCs applied in accordance with the following rule
that is necessary to satisfy symmetry.  If NSEG &amp;gt; 3, SPCs must be applied to both components 1 and
2 or to neither.  The same rule applies to components 4 and 5.
5.Grid points listed on CYAX Bulk Data entries must be in the a-set.
The CYSUP  Bulk Data entry provides for free body supports in cyclic symmetry analysis.&lt;br&gt;
The format of the CYSUP entry is as follows:
CYSUP
The total structure can have, at most, six rigid body degrees of freedom.  Supports that remove only the rigid
body motions are applied to the k = 0 and k = 1 harmonics of the components of motion listed on this entry.&lt;br&gt;
These components may not be constrained by SPCs, may not be referenced as dependent degrees of freedom
by MPCs and/or rigid elements, and may not be referenced on OMIT or OMIT1 Bulk Data entries (see
Reference 6.).

The loads are referenced by listing the identification numbers of one or two LOAD Bulk Data entries.  Scale
factors on the LOADCYN Bulk Data entry are used to form a linear combination of the load sets referenced
on the LOAD Bulk Data entries.  Alternatively, the LOADCYN Bulk Data entries may directly reference
load sets comprised of the types of static load definition entries shown in Table 16-6.
The loads listed on these entries are applied at the images in the segment referenced in field 4 of the
LOADCYN entry of the grid points and elements listed on these entries.  The coordinate systems for image
points are rotated and/or reflected from the coordinate system in the fundamental region.
Note that GRAV and RFORCE Bulk Data entries are not included in the above list.  These static load entries
are handled automatically in a very straightforward fashion through the LOADCYH Bulk Data entry.
The LOADCYH entry provides for the identification of referenced loads that are defined in terms of
harmonic components.  The format of the LOADCYH  entry is as follows:

This option is particularly useful for the definition of gravity (GRAV ) and centrifugal loads (RFORCE )
because you only need to specify GRAV or RFORCE under the HTYPE field on the entry and the correct
harmonic components of the specified load are automatically generated.  The component of gravity parallel
to the axis of symmetry produces harmonic loads of the order k = 0, and components of gravity perpendicular
to the axis of symmetry produce loads of the order k = 1.  Components of centrifugal force produce harmonic
loads of the order k =0 if the spin axis coincides with the axis of symmetry, and of the order k = 0, k = 1, and
k=2 if it does not.
The LOADCYT  Bulk Data entry is used with the AXI option to specify loads in terms of physical
components as a tabular function of the azimuth angle (measured in degrees).  The format of the LOADCYT&lt;br&gt;

These entries define a magnitude for the load.  The azimuthal variation of the applied load is specified on
the TABLEDi  entry referenced under the heading TABLEID.  The net applied load is the product of the
magnitude given on the load definition entry times the appropriate value on the TABLEDi entry.  The
heading METHODi on the LOADCYT entry is utilized to specify the type of interpolation to be used in
assigning loads to degrees of freedom.
Case Control Section  for Cyclic Symmetry
The general structure of the Case Control Section is discussed in this section.
The only Case Control commands that are unique to cyclic symmetry  are listed in Table 16-7.
The specific features of the Case Control Section are summarized as follows:
1.References to SPC  and/or MPC  sets in the Case Control Section must appear above the subcase level,
i.e., before the first subcase.
2.A HARMONICS (Case)  command must appear above the subcase level (i.e., before the commands that
describe the first subcase) to specify the harmonics for which solutions are to be computed.  The
HARMONIC command cannot reference a set definition that specifies “ALL”.  If you need to use
all of the harmonics, specify:
HARMONICS = ALL
3.One subcase is required per loading condition. Loads, enforced deformations, and enforced
displacements are requested in the standard manner, i.e., through LOAD , TEMP(LOAD) ,
DEFORM , and SPC set selections.  As described above, loads can be input in terms of physical
components and/or harmonic components.  Under the AXI option, loads may also be specified in
terms of physical components that are tabulated as a function of the azimuth angle (in degrees).
4.When the DIH option of cyclic symmetry is selected, advantage may be taken of overall planes of
symmetry when the applied loads are symmetrically and/or antisymmetrically disposed with respect
to these planes.  In these cases, loads need only be specified for segments in the first half plane when
there is one plane of overall symmetry and in the first quadrant when there are two planes of overall
symmetry.  The existence of one or two planes of overall symmetry is specified on the DSYM (Case)&lt;br&gt;
Case Control command.  One DSYM command is permitted per subcase.Table 16-7  Case Control Commands Unique to Cyclic Symmetry
Command Function
HARMONICS Specifies harmonics for which the computation is desired.
DSYM Provides for either one or two planes of overall symmetry under the DIH
option.
NOUTPUT Controls requests for the output of physical components.
HOUTPUT Controls requests for the output of harmonic components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Linear Statics Analysis User’s Guide
Case Control Section for Cyclic Symmetry586
Main Index
5.Requests for printed output for either or both of the harmonic components and the physical
components of all types of standard output quantities for static analysis are available through the
HOUTPUT (Case)  and NOUTPUT (Case)  Case Control commands, respectively.  These commands provide
the capability to specify the segments for which output is desired and, if harmonic output is requested,
the cyclic components for which output is desired.
If a subcase contains TEMP(LOAD) and/or DEFORM commands, irrespective of the presence of a
LOAD command, element force and stress output are only correct in terms of physical components
if the TEMP(LOAD) and the DEFORM loads are defined in terms of physical components.&lt;br&gt;
Similarly, if the TEMP(LOAD) and DEFORM data are provided in terms of harmonic
components, element force and stress output are only correct in terms of harmonic components.
If, under the DIH option of cyclic symmetry, a DSYM command is explicitly present under a
subcase, the output is, by default, limited to the segments in the first half plane if there is one plane
of overall symmetry, and to the segments in the first quadrant if there are two planes of overall
symmetry.  This default applies irrespective of the segments listed on NOUTPUT commands.
The specification of applied loads and the interpretation of the output data requires an awareness of
the orientation of the coordinate system associated with the individual segments.  For the ROT and
AXI options, the coordinate system used to define the model of the fundamental region is rotated
through the symmetry operation that “generates” each of the other identical segments.  For the DlH
option, the coordinate system used to define the model of the fundamental region (segment 1 R) is
rotated through the necessary symmetry operations that generate the R-half of each of the identical
segments.  The coordinate system for the L-half of a segment is the mirror image of the coordinate
system associated with the R-half of the segment in question; thus, the L-half of any segment has a
left-handed coordinate system.
6.Undeformed and deformed plots of the fundamental region may be requested.
7.Cyclic Symmetry does not support the use of SUBCOM /SUBSEQ  commands.  If you need to
combine loads, use the LOAD Bulk Data entry.
To illustrate some of the rules tabulated above, typical Case Control Sections for the cylinder ( Figure 16-8) and
square plate ( Figure 16-9) problems are shown in Figure 16-11 and Listing 16-2, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

The following comments are applicable to the above Case Control Section.
1.In Listing 16-1, the HARMONICS command specifies that solutions are to be computed only for the
zero harmonic.  If the applied loads are axisymmetric, no higher harmonics need to be considered.&lt;br&gt;
For Listing 16-2, HARMONICS = ALL specifies that solutions are to be computed for all meaningful
harmonics.
2.A DSYM  command appears in all four subcases of Listing 16-2.  The first three subcases specify that
the boundary conditions for both side 1 and side 2 are to be symmetric.  This specification has two
effects:  1) loads need only to be specified for the first quadrant of the structure (the fundamental
region in this case), and 2) output is only processed for the segments in the first quadrant of the model
irrespective of the analyst’s requests for output in other segments.  The particular lateral gravity
condition considered in the fourth subcase is symmetric with respect to side 1 of the fundamental
region and antisymmetric with respect to a plane perpendicular to side 1 of the fundamental region.&lt;br&gt;
It must be emphasized that the appropriate boundary conditions for each of the symmetry conditions
involved in this example are internally applied by the program.
3.Note that the specifications of loading conditions in the Case Control Section conform to the
procedural rules for static analysis in MSC Nastran.
4.Requests for output for selected segments are controlled through the NOUTPUT  Case Control
command.  For Listing 16-1, output requests are limited to the first segment, i.e., the fundamental
region.  For Listing 16-2, output requests for all four subcases are limited to segments in the first
quadrant because of the presence of the DSYM commands, even though output for ALL right-
handed segments is requested.  The specification of requests for specific output quantities in the Case
Control Section conform with the procedural rules for static analysis in MSC Nastran.
Axisymmetric  Example
The following cyclic symmetry example problem uses the same cylinder model that was discussed in Example
5 &amp;ndash; Buckling of a Cylinder Under Uniform Axial Load , 521. (See MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/cyclic2.dat)
A five degrees strip, as shown in Figure 16-10, is modeled using the axisymmetric  features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Linear Statics Analysis User’s Guide
Axisymmetric Example590
Main Index
Figure 16-10  A Five Degrees Strip of a Cylinder Using Axisymmetry
The input file is shown in Figure 16-3.  (See MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/cyclic1.dat) Since only a five
degrees strip is modeled, seventy-two segments are required to generate the full cylinder model internally.&lt;br&gt;
The CYSYM entry accomplishes this purpose.  Furthermore, the boundary points for segment one are
defined on the CYJOIN entries&amp;ndash;one each for side one and side two.  Note that with axisymmetry, no interior
points are allowed.  The applied load is a uniform compressive load applied at the top of the cylinder, using
the LOADCYT/TABLED1/FORCE combinations.  The TABLED1 defines the spatial distribution around
the circumference of the cylinder-which in this case is evenly distributed.  Since the structure is axisymmetric,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;591 CHAPTER 16

and the load is constant around the circumference, only the zeroth harmonic is required for the analysis. The
displacements at the top of the cylinder and stresses at the top and bottom of the cylinders are shown in
Figure 16-12.  The same output using the full model is shown in Figure 16-13 for comparison.

Introduction
The contact between parts is an important engineering process that requires analysis. This contact may be
due to physical gaps in the geometry, interference fits, or do to the assembly process. In the most general sense
contact is a nonlinear process potentially involving large geometric relative motion, friction and separation.
MSC Nastran has multiple ways to address this phenomena. This includes:
1.General nonlinear contact capability
2.Nonlinear gap element CGAP
3.Slideline technology
4.Simplified Support
5.Contact in SOL 101 and Permanent Glue
General nonlinear contact capability is available in SOL 400 and SOL 700 and will not be discussed here.
The nonlinear gap element (CGAP) is available in SOL 106, SOL 129 and SOL 400. In SOL 400 it should
not be used in conjunction with the general nonlinear contact capability. While the CGAP element has some
useful capabilities it is not recommended when large sliding occurs over the surfaces. Slideline technology
(bulk data options BLSEG and BWIDTH) are available in SOL 106 and SOL 129 and is not the
recommended approach. Note that SOL 700 also uses Slideline technology and is a general capability for
explicit dynamic nonlinear analysis. The Simplified Support method and Contact may be used in SOL 101
and are discussed in this chapter. Besides the determination of contact no other material or geometric
nonlinearity may occur in the analysis. The contact conditions are determined using an iterative procedure.
Simplified Support Method
The constraints are applied to grid points or spoints. The constraint ensures that:
1.The relative displacement (UR- relative distance between grid points on each contact surface) cannot
be negative. This is to ensure that there is no penetration. Therefore, the chosen degree-of-freedom
must be perpendicular to the contact surface and positive in the opening direction.
2.The force of contact constraint (QR) cannot be negative. This is to ensure that there is no tension.
The constraints are satisfied by an iterative technique that is built into SOL 101. The user can specify a
starting vector that defines the open/shut status of the gaps by specifying DMIG, CDSHUT. If the
CDSHUT vector is not specified, then all gaps will be assumed to be closed for the initial iteration. A solution
is obtained when all the gap constraints are satisfied, i.e., there&amp;rsquo;s no penetration and no tension forces. If job
does not converge during the iterations, a new random start vector is generated and the iterative procedure
will repeat until the number of iterations reaches the maximum iteration number or there are no more
random vectors to try.
This approach provides an alternative method to the use of GAP elements in SOL 106. The advantage is that
it is unnecessary to learn either how to calculate the GAP stiffness or how to control SOL 106. Multiple load
conditions are allowed, and each will be solved separately.
If the constraint is between a finite element model and a fixed boundary, then arranging one of the degrees-
of-freedom of the boundary grid points to represent the motion perpendicular to the boundary. A positive
displacement represents the motion away from the boundary. If, on the other hand, the constraint represents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;601 CHAPTER 17
Contact in Linear Static Analysis
Main Index
the relative motion between two bodies, MPC equations are needed to define this relative motion degrees-
of-freedom, which is then constrained to have a non-negative displacement.
A PARAM, CDITER entry along with a SUPORT  entry are required.  The CDPRT and CDPCH
parameters are used to control the output and an optional DMIG,CDSHUT can help to control the analysis.
To define CDITER entry, user may use &amp;ldquo;PARAM, CDITER, n&amp;rdquo; where n has a default value 0. When n &amp;gt; 0,
whose value is the maximum iteration number, means to perform constrained displacement iteration in the
analysis.
A SUPORT entry can be defined as Table 17-1,
Table 17-1&lt;br&gt;
IDi means the identification number of Grid Points. Ci means component number. This SURPORT entry
specifies the reference degrees of freedom for a rigid body motion.
CDPRT is the parameter to control the print of constraint violations during the iterations. When
CDPRT=YES (Default), the negative displacements and tension forces which do not satisfy constraints will
be printed out.
CDPCH controls the PUNCH output of DMIG, CDSHUT for the final state. When CDPCH=YES, it will
create a separate .pch file to print PUNCH output. Default value is &amp;ldquo;NO&amp;rdquo;
The linear gap element is supported in Patran under the Utilities Menu as shown in Figure 17-1.SUPORT ID1 C1 ID2 C2 ID3 C3 ID4 C4&lt;/p&gt;

Figure 17-1  Patran Linear Gap
The linear gap utility in Patran provides a convenient method of generating the linear gap elements by
graphically selecting the GRIDs that will be used in the formulation of the MPC equations.
The output forces for closed degrees-of-freedom will appear in the SPCFORCE output. In addition, optional
diagnostic information for the iterations can be requested (PARAM, CDPRT). A final state vector may also
be sent to a .pch file (PARAM, CDPCH).
The output should be examined to ensure that the job has converged in the given iterations iterations have
converged, since the results of the last iteration will be output.  The last iteration should have zero changes.
A typical converged output is shown below.  More detailed explanations are included in the actual examples.
The following is a list of limitations for the linear gap elements.
The only nonlinearity allowed is the constrained displacements.
There is no sliding friction.

Free bodies&amp;ndash;using the SUPORT entry to define rigid body modes&amp;ndash;cannot be used in the same
model with linear gap elements.  The parameters INREL and CDITER are mutually exclusive.  A
fatal message will be issued if both parameters are present.
There is no guarantee that the solution will converge or that all systems will follow the same path.
Example 1
As an example of using SUPORT’s for contact, please see the following diagram. The model consists of a
cantilever beam with a stopper and a vertical load of 30 lbs applied at the free-end. There is a clearance of
0.05 inch between the free-end and the stopper. The purpose of this problem is to find out if 30 lbs is
sufficient to cause the free-end to hit the stopper.
The first step in solving this problem is to define a variable  to monitor the opening between the free-
end (grid point 12) and the stopper (grid point 13). The following equation accomplishes this goal.
(17-1)
where:
accomplishes this goal. Grid point 13 can be removed from the equation since the stopper does not move.
Equation (17-1) can be simplified and recast as
(17-2)
so that an MPC equation can be written.  T wo scalar points are introduced in this case:  Scalar points 101
for   and 51 for .  Note that neither  nor  can be defined as dependent since they =the displacement at grid point 12
=the displacement at grid point 13

Equation (17-2) is represented by “MPC, 77” in Listing 17-1. Scalar point 51 must also be placed on the
SUPORT entry. In addition, an enforced displacement of 0.05 must also be imposed on scalar point 101.&lt;br&gt;
PARAM, CDITER,10 requests that a maximum of 10 iterations will be performed for this analysis.  If more
than 10 iterations are required for this problem, the results at the end of the 10th iteration will be printed.
PARAM, CDPRT,YES is optional in this case since it is the default.
An abridged output is shown in Listing 17-2. The large non-zero values for epsilon and strain energy for the
SUPORT degree of freedom can be safely ignored as we are not performing inertia relief analysis.  The
solution converges in 1 iteration as indicated by the following output.

The displacement T2 at grid point 12 is -0.05, which implies that the cantilever beam hits the stopper. The
load required to close the gap is:
(17-3)
which is what the spcforce output at grid point 11 shows.  The rest of the applied load 9.167 (30-20.833) is
reacted by the stopper as indicated by spcforce at grid point 51 and, similarly, the mpcforce at grid point 12.

Example 2
The second example is a thick pad supported on a rigid base with a vertical point load applied at the center.
Due to symmetry, a half model is used by applying the appropriate boundary condition at the center.
Figure 17-2 depicts the FE model. The problem is to determine where the lift off occurs along the base (grid
points 1 through 7.) This is considered as a planar problem and DOFs 3456 on the GRDSET entry are
constrained. “SPC1, 200” applies the symmetric boundary condition at the center line of the structure. The Pg3EIU12

potential contact points are specified by the seven SUPORT entries&amp;ndash;one for each grid point at the bottom.
In this case, since the contact is between a structure and a rigid surface, and there is no initial gap, the use of
the MPC is not required. A maximum of up to 20 iterations (PARAM, CDITER, 20) are defined for this
case. Furthermore, an initial guess of where the contact may occur is provided (DMIG,SHUT .) In this case,
grid points 1 and 7 are assumed to be shut and grid points 2 through 6 are assumed to be opened initially.&lt;br&gt;
PARAM,CDPCH,YES requests that the final open/shut configuration will be created in a separate punch
file. PARAM,CDPRT,YES requests the printing of the constraint violations during the iterations, which is
the default. Part of the input file for this example is shown in Listing 17-3.  (See

The problem converged at the 4th iteration. Looking at the output ( Listing 17-4), it is obvious to see that grid
points 1, 2, 3, and 4 are in contact as indicated under the “SHUT” output. Furthermore, the displacement
output illustrates that grid points 1, 2, 3, and 4 have zero displacement in the T2 direction&amp;ndash;indicating that
these four points are in contact. The T2 displacements for grid points 5, 6, and 7 are positive which indicates
that these three points have lifted off the foundation. The applied vertical load is reacted at the four grid
points (1-4) as illustrated by the spcforce output.&lt;/p&gt;

Contact in SOL 101 and Permanent Glued Contact
MSC Nastran provides users two contact schemes, Node-to-Segment contact and Segment-to-Segment
contact.
For Node-to-Segment (N2S) contact, MSC Nastran will create MPC (Multi-Points Constraints) equations
among the nodes which come into contact between Primary b ody and Secondary b ody. Then, augmented
Lagrange Multiplier Method will be used to embed constraints into analysis see the MSC Nastran Reference
Guide , Augmented Lagrange Multiplier Method  (Ch. 3) for more information. As shown in the picture below, a
secondary b ody and a primary b ody have to be defined. Once nodes satisfy the conditions in contact search,
they will be linked together by MPC equations. Normally, each active node has three constraint equations,
but when beam element or shell element comes into contact, the number of constraint equations increases to

Contact in Linear Static Analysis
Main Index
For Segment-to-Segment (S2S) contact, MSC Nastran will introduce auxiliary points for each contact
segment for contact search. Each contact segment has a specified number of auxiliary points which are
located at fixed positions on contact segments. Both distance and direction detections will be performed for
contact search. When segments are in contact, polygons or polylines will be generated. They can be treated
as normal interface elements representing the contact stiffness. Then, a weighted stiffness related to a penalty
factor is added to a normal stiffness matrix. A tangential stiffness induced by glue contact is similarly treated.
For more details on segment-to-segment contact, see the Nonlinear User’s Guide, Segment-to-Segment Contact&lt;br&gt;
(Ch. 9).
Contact in SOL 101
Contact in SOL 101 utilizes the full nonlinear contact algorithm of SOL 400 with all the typical linear
assumptions of SOL 101, i.e. no material nonlinearity, small displacement, and small strain. This general
contact capability has the following features
1.Multiple contact bodies are allowed.
2.Initial contact is unnecessary for the contact bodies.
3.Contact grid points may separate from each other.

Body 2 Body 2Segment 2 Segment 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Linear Static Analysis User’s Guide
Contact in SOL 101 and Permanent Glued Contact610
Main Index
4.The grid points of the contacting bodies do not need to be aligned, and the contact algorithm may
be used to join dissimilar meshes.
5.Both deformable-deformable and deformable-rigid contact are allowed. 1
6.Friction contact is allowed. Bilinear Coulomb or bilinear shear friction may be applied in the contact
analysis. In the general bilinear friction algorithms, the relative tangential displacement is split into
stick (elastic contribution) and slip (plastic contribution) components. In SOL 101, only stick (elastic
contribution) to relative tangential displacement is computed.
The primary benefit of Contact in SOL 101 is that you can use the full SOL 400 nonlinear contact algorithm
and capabilities for “linear” structural models where the only nonlinearity is from the contact. Also, user may
keep the same model for both linear and nonlinear analyses. For example, after running a model in SOL 101,
if user determines that there are other nonlinear effects, such as material nonlinearity or large rotation, the
model can simply be switched to SOL 400 without any requirement to redefine the contact control
parameters, tables, and other entries as both SOL 400 and SOL 101 use the same contact definitions.
Full nonlinear contact may output control parameters and iteration messages in the .f04 file and an STS file.
Note that the linear GAP contact defined by PARAM,CDITER,n is still supported, but it should not be used
in association with the surfaces defined for general contact.
Permanent Glued Contact M o d el i n g  i n SOL 101
Permanent Glued contact is a special type of contact model which imposes the condition of no relative (both
normal and tangential) motion between the contacting surfaces and no separation occurs.
For Permanent Glued contact, MSC Nastran will form the required constraints without entering the full
nonlinear contact algorithm. It should be seen that if there is no initial contact between the contacting bodies,
these constraints cannot be formed and the run may fail in permanent glued contact analysis due to
insufficient constraints. If the contact surfaces cannot be explicitly established, tolerance of the contact
surface may be set and any grid points falling within these tolerances will be GLUED. With this option you
can also require that the algorithm bring the surfaces into contact before applying the constraints. The
primary benefit of the Permanent Glued contact is to join dissimilar meshes.
Interface to General and Permanent Glued Contact
As with most real world engineering problems, the majority of users will be using a pre- and post-processors
like Patran or SimXpert to build the FE model. Of course, the controls and definitions of the contact may be
built in the input file directly. Here is the brief description of the interface to contact control and definition.
Input for the General Contact and Permanent Glued contact starts with the Case Control command
BCONTACT in Case Control Section as
BCONTACT = n
Where n is the Identification number of contact table BCTABLE or BCTABLE1 in Bulk Data Section.

Contact in Linear Static Analysis
Main Index
Prior to bodies coming into contact due to load application, it may be desirable to initially identify contacting
bodies or specify initial stress-free contact. Thus, Bulk Data entries such as BCPARA have an ID field which
may be 0 or blank. (For the BCPARA entry, BCPARA,0 is usually the typical and only usage, as it is used to
define initial contact parameters.) For other entries such as a BCTABL1 entry, a BCTABL1,0 entry would
be used to identify the contact bodies that can possibly contact each other at the start of the analysis. Then
BCTABL1, n with n &amp;gt; 0 and selected in Case Control by a BCONTACT - n entry, is used to control contact
during loading.
BCPARA defines global parameters. It means these entries might be overwritten by BCONPRG and
BCONPRP . For example, FNTOL might be overwritten by the same entries inputs in BCONPRP .
To turn on segment-to-segment contact, METHOD need to be used.
When quadratic element is detected and user does not define IBSEP , the default IBSEP=0 will be set to 2 to
guarantee successful analysis.
Guidelines and Limitations
1.Surface-to-surface 3-D contact is currently supported. For solids contacting solids, the contact
surfaces contain the grid points. For shell surfaces contacting each other, the contacting surfaces do
not contain the grid points. Taking the shell thickness into consideration, for contacting shell
surfaces, the distance between grid points is ,  where  and   are the thickness of the
two contacting shells. For deformable-rigid contact, contact occurs when the position of the shell grid
plus or minus half the thickness projected with the normal comes into contact with the rigid segment.
Note that, if you specify that the shell grid points are touching surface, the algorithm will assume
contact penetration.IBSEP Flag for separation based on stresses or forces. (Integer &amp;gt; 0; Default = 0)
0 Separation based on forces.
1 Separation based on absolute stresses (force/area)
2 Separation based on absolute stress (extrapolating integration point stresses)
3 Relative nodal stress (force/area)
4 Separation based on relative stress (extrapolating integration point stresses)
Only option 2 and 4 can be used with mid-side node elements where the mid-side nodes
contact (LINQUAD=-1). For segment to segment contact, the program will set IBSEP to
2 internally.
FTYPE Friction type. See Remark 5. (Integer)
0 No friction. (Default)
6 Bilinear Coulomb friction.
7 Bilinear Shear friction.

Contact in SOL 101 and Permanent Glued Contact618
Main Index
2.Contact in SOL 101 means standard linear small strain, small rotation and full nonlinear contact
algorithm without material nonlinearity. Linear Contact (LINCNT) is preferred method in SOL 101
to achieve consistent linear solution, in which contact relation is built upon initial configuration, but
not updated configuration through iterations. It is recommended to set SYSTEM(786)=1 to turn on
Linear Contact as default in SOL 101. Refer to Nonlinear User’s Guide for detailed information of
Linear Contact (LINCNT).
3.Permanent Glued Contact is defined when the IGLUE field of the BCTABLE or BCONPRG is set&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0 or &amp;lt;0. In this option, all degrees of freedom of the contact grid points are constrained with MPCs
or contact constraint matrix in the case of deformable-deformable contact once the grid points have
come in contact. The relative tangential motion of a contact grid is zero in the case of deformable-
rigid contact. If IGLUE &amp;gt; 0 on the BCTABLE or BCONPRG, MSC Nastran will form the required
constraints without entering the full nonlinear contact algorithm. If IGLUE&amp;lt;0, MSC Nastran will
form constraint matrix based on initial contact, but it will enter the full nonlinear contact algorithm
in order to handle large displacement or large rotations. If there is no initial contact between the
contact bodies, these constraints cannot be formed and the run will fail. Therefore special cases arise,
described as follows:
a.To run Permanent Glue contact, with no initial contact between the contact bodies, user may
define entry BCPARA,0,NLGLUE,1 to turn on the general nonlinear contact algorithm of
nonlinear analysis (SOL 400). Use Case Control BCONTACT etc. to define possible contacting
surfaces. The algorithm will then determine the contact surfaces and &amp;ldquo;glue&amp;rdquo; the bodies together.
b.Or optionally on the BCONPRG entry, specify a value for the ERROR field. Any grid point
within this error tolerance will be considered to be in contact. If the user sets ICOORD=1 on the
BCONPRG entry and this BCONPRG is referred by BCTABL1,0 then initial stress free contact
can be turned on and the grid points will be physically moved so that the surfaces are actually in
contact. You may also use the Bulk Data entry BCPARA,0 field THKOFF to have the algorithm
to ignore shell thickness when computing contact penetration.
4.Each grid and element should be, at most, in one body. Solids and shells should not be mixed in the
same body.
5.Deformable bodies can contact rigid bodies. Contact between rigid bodies is not supported.
6.In the following text, examples of contact bulk data entries and their fields are given. Each &amp;ldquo;Entries&amp;rdquo;
and &amp;ldquo;Fields&amp;rdquo; were defined once. However, the parameter may appear on multiple &amp;ldquo;Entries.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Field&amp;rdquo;
values on the BCPARA entry may be overridden by &amp;ldquo;Field&amp;rdquo; values on the BCONPRG and
BCONPRP.
7.When defining deformable-deformable contact, the default rule is that the grid points of a body may
contact any other body and the searching starts with the body having the lowest ID number and ends
with the body having the highest ID number. Depending on the contact constraints found, it is
possible that grid points of a body with a higher ID number contact surfaces of bodies with a lower
ID number. This default behavior (so called double sided contact) can be overruled by the user in
different ways, namely via the BCBDPRP option or the BCONPRG option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;619 CHAPTER 17
Contact in Linear Static Analysis
Main Index
Via the BCBDPRP - ISTYP option, two different global search orders can be defined. The first is so
called single sided contact, which means that the search for contact for grid points of a deformable
body is only done with respect to surfaces of the body itself and of bodies with a higher ID number.
The other activates a process which tries to optimize the set of contacting grid points and contacted
surfaces and is only recommended for rare cases where a proper set of &amp;quot; PRIMARY&amp;quot;  and &amp;quot; SECNDRY&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
bodies cannot be defined by the user.
The recommended way of overruling the default search process is via the BCONPRG - ISEARCH
option, where a local search method can be defined for each body combination. The BCONECT
option allows the user to define which pair of contact bodies can potentially come into contact and,
if they can come into contact, it is also possible to specify that grid points of the body indicated as
&amp;ldquo;SECNDRY&amp;rdquo;  can only contact surfaces of the body indicated as &amp;quot; PRIMARY&amp;quot; , and not the other way
around. In this way one can define single sided contact per body combination, thus overruling the
default double sided contact.
8.When defining deformable-deformable contact using the node-to-segment method, it is important
to ensure that grid points of the body with the finer mesh contacting surfaces of a body with a coarser
mesh. When defining deformable-rigid contact, it is important that the deformable bodies all have
ID numbers lower than the rigid bodies.
9.When using the segment-to-segment method softer bodies should be contacting stiffer bodies. E.g.,
rubber should be a SECNDRY a nd steel should be a contacted body or PRIMARY.&lt;br&gt;
10. Avoid sharp corners in contacted surfaces. It is better to have a finer mesh and smooth surface where
possible.
11. In sliding contact try to have smooth surfaces. Use the SPLINE option, which generates a Coons
surface (where the mesh surfaces are &amp;ldquo;patched&amp;rdquo;). This helps considerably by avoiding scattering and
accelerating convergence.
12. NLPARM (Case Control) and NLSTEP (Case Control) are both supported in SOL101. For
SOL101 general contact analysis, since the only nonlinearity comes from contact, some fields are not
user-controllable in NLPARM. These fields include DT(=0.0), KMETHOD(=AUTO),
KSTEP(=500), INTOUT(=NO) and MAXLS(=0). NLPARM is not required for running SOL101
contact jobs. If users want to use NLSTEP, the keyword &amp;ldquo;LCNT&amp;rdquo; needs to claim for the Contact in
SOL101. Users may refer to the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide  for more explanations about
the parameters which are used in NLSTEP for Contact in SOL101.
13. The motion of deformable bodies is prescribed by applying displacements or loads to the bodies. It
is NOT recommended that enforced displacements or point loads are placed on grid points that
might come into contact with a rigid body.
14. It is recommended that MPC relationships should be avoided for grid points that might come into
contact.
15. Rigid bodies may have prescribed velocity, position, or load. See BCRIGID entry.
16. The tolerance value lies equally above and below the contacted surface. That is to say, the &amp;ldquo;thickness&amp;rdquo;
of the contacted surface is twice the value of the Tolerance. Often, the grid points are almost touching
the contacted surface. The algorithm provides for a biased tolerance with a smaller distance on the
outside (the side nearest the contacting surface) and a larger distance on the inside. This avoids the&lt;/p&gt;

close grid points from coming into contact and separating again. There is a default bias of 0 in the
SOL 400 and SOL 101 algorithm. The user may set the bias. See BCONPRG entry field BIAS. The
outside contact area is computed as (1-BIAS)*ERROR and the inside contact area is
(1+BIAS)*ERROR.
17. In SOL 101 and SOL 400, bilinear Coulomb (see BCPARA entry, FTYPE = 6) or bilinear shear (see
BCPARA entry, FTYPE = 7) friction is available. Bilinear shear is usually used for forging processes.
Bilinear Coulomb is used for most friction applications.
18. Currently, quadratic (8-noded) shell elements are not recommended for use with contact.
Example 1: Permanent Glued Contact
As an example of Permanent Glued Contact, Figure 17-3 shows a vertical shell plate lying on a solid beam.
They are to be glued together, then have a FORCE applied to the upper edge of the shell sufficient to bend
both parts. Note on Figure 17-3 the dissimilar meshes and the force direction. Part of the input file (see
MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/lnrcmc02.dat) is shown as Listing 17-5. Permanent glued contact is selected
when the IGLUE field in the BCONPRG entry is  0.

bodies (note the BSURF entries are not shown). The main difference is the inclusion of IGLUE=3 on the
BCONPRG entry to select permanent gluing. A request for ground check, a set selection for printed output
and full output for plotting has been included. The plot in Figure 17-4 shows the displacement result of the
glued bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

As a second example of permanent glue, the plates on the CINTC example shown in Figure 4-63 will be joined
with permanent glued contact. The Bulk Data entries shown in Listing 4-12 can be replaced by the Bulk Data
entry shown in Listing 17-6. (See MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/itfpltq4glue.dat) plus the Case Control
command BCONTACT=1.
Listing 17-6  Permanent Glued Bodies
The BCPARA entry selects the nonlinear contact algorithm because there is no initial contact. In the
BCONPRG, IGLUE=3 is selected for full moment carrying permanent glue with shell contact. Also
COPTS1 and COPTM1=60, which are the setting for permanent glue contact with shell elements. The
results are virtually identical to Figure 4-65.

Feature Description
The users specify their preference of achieving better performance or accuracy. MSC Nastran selects default
values of control parameters accordingly. The users can also change the values of some specific control
parameters based on their analysis requirements.
User Inputs
The analysis preference is specified from the first line of NLSTEP Bulk Data Entry using “LCPERF” or
“LCACCU” keyword. This entry also allows the user to customize values of specific control parameters
through the new “LCNT” keyword. For the complete entry see NLSTEP  in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference
Guide .
NLSTEP Describes the Control Parameters for Mechanical, Thermal and Coupled Analysis in MSC Nastran
SOL 400 and for Linear Contact Analysis in MSC Nastran SOL 101.
Specifies the convergence criteria, step size control between coupled loops and step/iteration control for each
physics loop in MSC Nastran SOL 400. Defines analysis preference and control parameters for linear contact

Guidelines and Limitations
The performance of “LCPERF” selection is expected to improve by two to seven times for most models
compared to the current default settings of linear contact analysis. However, this enhancement applies to
SOL 101 Linear Static Analysis only. For some contact models, specifying “LCPERF” or “LCACCU”

Local Adaptive Mesh Refinement
Introduction
MSC Nastran has a Local Adaptive Mesh Refinement capability which can be used to increase accuracy when
starting from “rough” initial meshes. and can be used in situations involving contact and/or superelements.
Adaptive mesh refinement is an automatic mechanism for altering and controlling locally the size of the finite
element mesh. Beginning with an initial mesh provided by the user, a sequence of new meshes is
automatically generated. Each new mesh of this sequence is an offspring of the previous, coarser mesh and is
obtained by refining (by subdivision) a subset of their elements.
Figure 18-1 illustrates this mechanism, it is a 2D elastic analysis of a Mode-I fracture specimen.
Figure 18-1  2D Elastic analysis of a mode-I fracture specimen
Adaptive mesh refinement can be applied to meshes that combine elements of different types (triangular or
quadrilateral surface elements, tetrahedral, pentahedral or hexahedral volume elements), different
interpolation orders (linear or quadratic), different dimensionality (line, surface or volume elements), or
models substructured into different superelements.
The following elements are supported:
Line elements: CBEAM, CBEAM3 (with no offsets or warping), CBEND, CBAR (with no offsets),
CONROD, CROD, CTUBE, CVISC.
Surface elements: CTRIA3, CTRIAR, CTRIA6, CQUAD4, CQUADR, CQUAD8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;621 CHAPTER 18
Adaptive Meshing
Main Index
Volume elements: CTETRA, CPENTA, CHEXA.
Adaptive mesh refinement (or h-adaptivity)  attempts to change the element size while keeping interpolation
order unaltered.
When an element is refined (subdivided) but its adjacent elements are not refined a non conforming mesh
is generated. Nodes created on the boundary between a refined and a non refined element are referred to as
hanging-nodes  (Figure 18-2).
Figure 18-2  Hanging node
In MSC Nastran, all degrees of freedom (1 to 6) associated to a hanging node are automatically constrained
using internal Multipoint Constraint (MPC) equations derived from the isoparametric mapping.
Local adaptive mesh refinement is activated by the Case Control command HADAPT and controlled by the
two Bulk Data entries HADAPTL and HADACRI along with the optional feature angle parameter VARPHI
(Figure 18-3).
The Case Control command HADAPT (Case)  in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide must
reference the Bulk Data entry HADAPTL.
The Bulk Data entry HADAPTL  in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide provides an interface to
control the number of iterations in the adaptive mesh refinement loop (REPEAT field), the
refinement criteria (CRITID field), which must reference a Bulk Data entry HADACRI, the
refinement region where the latter will be applied (WHEREMETHOD and WHEREID fields), the
placement method for new mid-edge nodes (SNAPMETHOD field), and the maximum levels of
refinements permitted to any individual element in the mesh (MAXLEVEL field).
The Bulk Data entry HADACRI  in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide provides an interface for
the specification of the refinement criterion along with criteria specific parameters.
The parameter VARPHI  in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide , (feature angle) can be optionally
adjusted when corners and edges are not satisfactory detected to control how sharp a mesh edge or
vertex should be in order to be consider a split edge or vertex between two otherwise continuous
curves or surfaces.
Different mesh refinement criteria might be applied to different refinement regions by combining
two pairs of Bulk Data entries HADAPTL and HADACRI. Furthermore, mesh refinement can be
driven by a combined error indicator based on stresses arising from multiple load cases.&lt;/p&gt;

Selection of Refinement Region
Adaptive mesh refinement can be either requested for all elements in the mesh or for a subset of elements.
T wo different mesh refinement subsets are supported:
elements sharing a given property ID
 elements belonging to a given superelement.
The refinement region can be specified by the user via the pair of fields (WHEREMET ,WHEREID) in the
HADAPTL Bulk Data entry as follows:
If mesh refinement must be restricted to all elements sharing a given property identified with
property ID “PID”, then the WHEREMET field must be set to the keyword “PROP” and
WHEREID field must be set to the integer PID:
If mesh refinement must be restricted to a particular superelement identified with superelement ID
“SEID”, then the WHEREMET field must be set to the keyword “SUPER” and the WHEREID
field must be set to the integer SEID:1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
HADAPTL 1 101 PROP PID
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
HADAPTL 1 101 SUPER SEID&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;623 CHAPTER 18

Main Index
Finally, if mesh refinement is requested for all elements in the mesh, then the field WHEREMET
must be set to the keyword “ALL” and the WHEREID field is ignored.
Consider by way of example a cylindrical shell subjected to a concentrated force as depicted in
(Figure 18-4). T wo different properties (labeled with IDs 1 and 2) have been assigned to the top and
bottom halves of the shell. The concentrated force is applied on the center node of the shell (located
at the interface between both regions) and in the direction normal to the shell.
Figure 18-4  Pinched cylindrical shell. Different properties have been assigned to elements in the top and
bottom halves of the shell.
Mesh refinement using the error indicator based criterion have been requested for the bottom half
(property 2):
Figure 18-5 shows the sequence of meshes and deformed configuration obtained during the adaptive
mesh refinement process. Notice that even though the refinement is mainly confined to the bottom
half, it also propagates a few layers into the top half due to the 2-to-1 rule. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Selection of Refinement Criterion
The refinement criterion that will be applied to the refinement region is selected by specifying a refinement
criteria ID on the CRITID field in the HADAPTL Bulk Data entry:
along with a corresponding HADACRI Bulk Data entry,
The particular refinement criteria is specified using the TYPE field in the HADACRI Bulk Data entry. Four
different refinement criteria, can be selected, namely:1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

fields F1 to F6.
Combination of Subcases with Error Indicator Based Criterion
The error indicator is computed using the finite element stresses and measures indirectly the stress
discontinuity across interelement boundaries. When multiple load cases are defined, multiple finite element
stress solutions are obtained (one for each load case) and therefore, multiple instances of the error indicator
are computed.
Every load case that should be considered for the computation of the error indicator must include an
HADAPT Case Control command referencing a unique HADAPTL Bulk Data entry:
One single pair of Bulk Data entries HADPTL and HADACRI are required. The unique HADAPTL entry
must be referenced by an HADAPT Case Control command included in both load cases ( Figure 18-6).

User Information Messages (.f06 File)
The output requests for displacements, stresses, forces, etc., are honored for all the iterations of the adaptive
mesh refinement loop ( Figure 18-7). Thus, for example, if DISPLACEMENT=ALL is specified in the Case
Control section of the input file, then the grid point displacements will be written to the .f06 file not only
for the initial mesh, but for all the subsequent meshes created during the mesh refinement process.
At the end of each refinement cycle in the adaptive mesh refinement loop ( Figure 18-7) the following user
information message is printed to the .f06 file to signal the end of the analysis supported on the current mesh
and beginning of a new analysis supported on the refined mesh obtained from the previous:
The total number of elements meeting the user’s specified criterion and the total number of elements actually
refined is reported to the .f06 at the end of each successful refinement instance (step 3 and 4 in Figure 18-7)
and prior to the transference of analysis data between unrefined and refined meshes (step 5 in Figure 18-7). &amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&lt;/p&gt;

Figure 18-7  User information messages reporting the progress of the adaptive mesh refinement loop
Notice that the number of elements actually refined will be in general different from the number of elements
meeting the refinement criterion because the refinement is propagated from the latter to the neighbors.
When the error indicator based criterion is selected, a user message is printed to the .f06 file informing the
total number of elements scanned for the computation of the error indicator, the mean square average over
the whole mesh of the local error indicator and the relative change of this magnitude with respect to the
previous iteration in the adaptive mesh refinement loop:
It bears emphasis that the error indicator  is not an error estimator  in the sense that its numerical value does
not measure the actual (absolute) error but gives rather a relative assessment of where the mesh should be
refined.
If no elements meet the user specified criterion or no elements are actually refined, the adaptive mesh
refinement loop is terminated and corresponding messages are printed to the F06 file.

refinement loop. Different postprocessing files are automatically created in the same directory and with the
same name as the input file and with the extension “ i.xdb ” or “i.op2 ” where i is the iteration counter
in the adaptive mesh refinement loop. Thus, for example, if the input file is fender.dat, then, the
sequence of files  will be:
fender.xdb  or fender.op2
fender.1.xdb or fender.1.op2
…
fender.i.xdb or fender.i.op2
The first file in the sequence will contain postprocessing data corresponding to the initial mesh and analysis
results and subsequent files will contain postprocessing information for each refined mesh created during the
adaptive mesh refinement process.
Bulk Data File Images of the Sequence of Refined Meshes
During the adaptive mesh refinement process, new elements, new grid points, new boundary conditions, new
multipoint constraints and new pressure loads are created automatically. Furthermore, contact bodies are
internally redefined to subtract refined elements and replace them by their children elements.
Bulk data file images containing the new mesh and analysis data created after each refinement cycle is
automatically generated prior to the beginning of each analysis cycle.
Each bulk data file image is created in the same directory and with the same name as the input file and with
the extension “ .seid.i.bdf ” where seid  is the superelement ID (0 for models with no superelements)
and i is the iteration counter in the adaptive mesh refinement loop. Thus, for example, if the input file is
fender.dat  and contains no upstream superelements (only the residual structure, i.e. SEID=0), then the
sequence of bulk data files created automatically will be named:
fender.0.1.bdf
…
fender.0.i.bdf
…
These bulk data file images might be used as the starting point for the creation of a new analysis input files
supported on any of the refined mesh obtained during the adaptive mesh refinement cycle.
Modeling Guidelines
The number of elements created during refinement grows exponentially. If on each refinement
iteration , a fraction  of the total number of elements  is refined by subdividing each element
of this fraction into  children elements (with  for line elements,  for surface
elements and  for volume elements), then, the total number of element at iteration&lt;br&gt;
will be:i fiNi
M M 2= M 4=
M 8= i1+
Ni1+Ni= fiNi– fiNi+ M Ni1fiM1– +  =&lt;/p&gt;

Therefore, if the fraction  remains approximately constant during the mesh refinement process, i.e.,
if  with  a constant independent of , then the number of elements at iteration  will be given
by the estimate
where  is the number of elements in the initial mesh (the mesh provided by the user). For
example, in a surface mesh  and if approximately 1/3 of the elements are refined on each
refinement iteration , then the number of elements at iteration  will be roughly
. Thus an initial structure with thousands of shell elements  will be
refined into millions of shell elements  in about 10 iterations. In a 3D mesh
, and if approximately 1/3 of the elements are refined on each iteration, the total number
of elements expected at iteration i will be approximately . Thus, a mesh with
thousands of 3D elements will be refined into millions of 3D elements in about 6 iterations.
Exponential growth of the number of elements implies that adaptive mesh refinement is memory
intensive. As a rough estimate, each refinement iteration  requires on the order of  integer
words of memory where  is the number of elements of the mesh created during refinement
iteration .
Instead of the traditional modeling practice, the user should start the process with an initial mesh
preferably coarse which will be refined automatically and selectively according to the refinement
criterion.
The effectiveness of the refinement process depends on an appropriate detection of geometric
corners, creases and edges and interfaces between elements of different properties. Detection of
geometric features requires the selection of a proper value for the Geometric Feature parameter
(PARAM,VARPHI).
When the initial mesh is very coarse and the boundary of the structure under analysis is poorly
approximated, it is recommended to activate the automatic projection of mid-edge nodes onto a
smooth approximation of the mesh boundary using SNAPMETH=1.  Convergence of the mesh
refinement process might be dramatically improved using this method.
The user should avoid the use of MPC sets 90000000 to 99999999 which are reserved for hanging

When mesh refinement is restricted to a specific mesh refinement region (by selecting
WHEREMET=PROP or WHEREMET=SUPER in the HADAPTL Bulk Data entry), the user
should expect refinement also in a few layers away from the refinement region due to the enforced

In partitioned superelements, the HADAPT entry must be specified in the main bulk data section.
Entries specified in the Bulk Data Section corresponding to individual parts (sections beginning
with BEGIN SUPER) will be ignored.
When using regular superelements, the Bulk Data Section must begin with BEGIN SUPER as
opposed to BEGIN BULK in order to the refinement to be appropriately propagated across
superelement boundaries. If BEGIN BULK is used, grid points on the superelement boundaries will
be duplicated and not shared by the joining superelements.
Limitations
The error indicator based refinement criterion can be used with surface or volume elements, but not
with line elements. The latter can be subdivided with any other of the refinement criteria, or when
they are attached to the boundary of a surface or volume elements
Refinement of CBEAM, CBEAM3 with offsets or warping are not supported. Refinement of CBAR
with offsets is not supported.
Temperature loads are not supported. Similarly, the HEATSTAT=YES option in SOL 101 that
runs a preliminary thermal analysis to compute thermal loads for a subsequent structural analysis is
not supported.&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction to Smart S uperelement
MSC Nastran smart s uperelement (S SE) capability employs ODYSSEE machine learning technology for
reduced order modeling (ROM) to create parameterized superelements [1]. The SSE is parameterized with
model (geometric, material, etc.) parameters so that the user can readily change the superelement’ s properties
in each simulation to explore the design space  without having to completely reprocess the superelement (SE) .
Figure 19-1  Schematic Diagram of MSC Nastran Model using multiple SSEs
The SSE capability is supported in the following MSC Nastran solution sequences:
Sol 101: Linear Static analysis.
Sol 103, 107, 110: Normal modes and complex modes.
Sol 108, 109: Linear direct frequency and transient response.
Sol 111, 112: Linear modal frequency and transient response.
Sol 400: Nonlinear static and transient analysis
Here, we discuss the SSE capability for the linear statics. For linear dynamics , please see [ 2].
Benefits
Using the SSE capability the user will be able to explore the design space by conducting MSC Nastran
simulation with different SSE p arameters. Additionally, an analysis using SSE is typically much faster than a
traditional MSC Nastran assembly model  as there is no need to reprocess the entire superelement each time.&lt;/p&gt;

Workflow
The basic SSE p rocess is a 2-Step procedure:
Figure 19-2  2-Step Generate/Consume SSE Procedure
1.Generate Linear Statics SSE ( done outside MSC Nastran, i.e. off-line):
A MSC Nastran base external superelement generation (EXTSEOUT) f inite element model of the
SSE c omponent is developed. The input file i s the same as a traditional EXTSEOUT input file w ith
the additional option to output the reduced matrices, loads, displacement OTM required to
generate the SSE t o a HDF5 file.
User identifies SSE p arameters in ODYSSEE CAE – Lunar[3] using the DOE generator tool.
In the Lunar DOE generator, the user creates a design-of-experiments (DOEs) table to train the
SSE ( the choice of DOEs is model specific and requires domain knowledge). The SSE i s trained to
predict the output matrices for a given set of input parameters. A batch simulation of DOEs is run:
each instance/experiment of this step requires an updated valid MSC Nastran input file
(automatically created by Lunar). The output of each experiment is automatically extracted (Lunar
supports extracting output data from MSC Nastran HDF5 format) to create a dataset (X, Y) for
training and validating the SSE:
X: User identified, input parameters of SSE.
Y: Output to be supplied by SSE. For the linear case  this clearly is,
[K]a×a : reduced stiffness matrix (a-size )
[F]a×nl : reduced load vector (a row size × nl), where nl is the n umber of loads (referred to as PA
in HDF5 file)
[DISP-OTM]a x a : the two displacement output transformation matrices (OTMs),
a.[MUG1]&lt;em&gt;×a : The free boundary displacement OTM, (&lt;/em&gt; = number of user requested
output grids × a-row size )
b.[MUG10]&lt;em&gt;×a : The free boundary displacement OTM, (&lt;/em&gt; = number of user requested
output grids × nl)
Creating the SSE Functional Mock-up Unit ( FMU ) in Lunar by training it with dataset (X,Y): After
training, a good SSE m odel should be able to predict Y for a yet unseen value of X with acceptable
accuracy. In essence, the linear SSE i s a parametrized SE which can change its representation
instantly by changing the input parameters X.&lt;/p&gt;

2.Consumption of SSE ( done in MSC Nastran, On-line):
The SSE will be consumed in MSC Nastran with a process that is similar to the inclusion of a Part
SE in a MSC Nastran Analysis except that a SSE is indicated by the presence of a SEBULK entry with
SETYPE=EXTROM. The SSE p arameters are specified inside the SE’s bulk data through the
presence of pairs of DESVAR/DVMREL1 or DESVAR/DVPREL1 bulk data entries.&lt;/p&gt;

EXTSEOUT Input File
After the generation of baseline modes, the user prepares the EXTSEOUT analysis file which will be used by
Lunar to generate the SSE. This file is just a traditional EXTSEOUT analysis file for the SSE c omponent
which outputs the external superelement data to a HDF5 (instead of OP2/OP4/etc.) file supported by Lunar
as follows:

ENDDATA
The EXTSEOUT case control with HDF5 option w ill store the output matrices on a HDF5 (.h5) file which
is required as Lunar currently only supports the import of HDF5 file from MSC Nastran, e.g.,
EXTSEOUT(ASMBULK=MAN,EXTBULK,EXTID=20,HDF5)
After running the EXTSEOUT analysis, MSC Nastran will produce two files ( .asm  and .pch ) that define
the necessary connection information for consuming the SSE in Assembly run. These files assume that the
connection nodes in the assembly run will have the same IDs as the grids in the reduction run. If this is not
the case, the user can modify the SEBULK entry to use the AUTO method, or manually provide the pairs.
The EXTSEOUT input file is then imported into Lunar to generate the SSE F MU using the workflow
shown in Figure 19-3 (Please see [ 2] for further details)&lt;/p&gt;

Linear Statics SSE C onsumption in a MSC Nastran
Assembly Run
The process of consuming a SSE i n MSC Nastran SOL 101 assembly run is similar to linear dynamics (Please
see [ 2] for further details).
Guidelines and Limitation
The following guidelines and limitation are associated with the capability:
1.In the EXTSEOUT ( SSE g eneration) analysis the displacement output request is required to generate
displacement OTMs which will be employed in interior data recovery for the SSE i n the assembly
run. If the size of these OTMs are very large then both the training time and time required to conduct
interior data recovery for the SSE may be long. It is therefore recommended that the user only request
the displacement at grids of interest  in EXTSEOUT analysis , e.g. using,
SET 200 = 34,566, 445,&amp;hellip;
DISP=200
2.Repeating or minoring of a SSE is not supported. As a workaround, the user can reuse same FMU
multiple times for creating a new SSE together with a SELOC entry and a modified SECONCT
entry.
3.All the FMU files used in the assembly run should be placed in the same directory as the MSC Nastran
input file.
Example
Examples of a door frame assembly using the SSE capability in SOL 101 are p rovided in  the M SC Nastran
Documentation Installation directory : tpl\odyssee  and tpl6\odyssee  (Note  that running these
examples requires an existing installation of ODYSSEE CAE).

Introduction to Grid Point Weight Generation
The grid point weight generator  (GPWG) calculates the masses, centers of gravity, and inertias of the
mathematical model of the structure.  The data are extracted from the mass  matrix by using a rigid-body
transformation calculation.  Computing the mass properties is somewhat complex because a finite element
model may have directional mass properties, that is, the mass may differ in each of the three coordinate
directions.  From a mathematical point of view, the MSC Nastran mass may have tensor properties similar to
the inertia tensor.  This complexity is reflected in the GPWG output.  All of the transformations used in
calculating the mass properties are shown for the general case.  Since most models have the same mass in each
of the three coordinate directions, the GPWG output provides more information than you generally need.
To avoid unnecessary confusion and at the same time provide the necessary information for the advanced
user, the discussion of the GPWG is separated into two sections.  In Commonly Used Features , a basic discussion
is given that should satisfy most users.  If you need additional information, read Example with Direction-
Dependent Masses .
In both sections, a simple model consisting of four concentrated masses is used to demonstrate the GPWG
output.  In the first section, the mass is the same in each direction.  For the second section, the mass is
different in each of the three directions.
Commonly Used Features
To demonstrate the typical output generated by the GPWG, a small model consisting of four concentrated
masses as shown in Figure 19-1 is used.  This model is typical of most models because the mass is the same in
each coordinate direction.  The number of masses has been kept small so you can better understand the
physics.
Concentrated masses are located at four different grid points.  The displacement coordinate system for each
of the grid points is the basic coordinate system.

To request the GPWG output, you must add parameter GRDPNT  in either the Bulk Data Section or the Case
Control Section as follows:
PARAM,GRDPNT,x
If
For the four masses shown in Figure 19-1, the resulting GPWG output is given in Figure 19-2.
Figure 19-2  GPWG Output for the Four Concentrated Mass Model
The [ MO] matrix represents the rigid-body mass properties of the structure and is generally not needed for
model checkout.  This matrix represents an intermediate step in computing the inertia properties of the
structure.  The [ S] matrix should always be equal to the identity matrix when the mass is the same in each
coordinate direction, which is the typical case.  If this matrix is not the identity matrix, inspect the model for
inconsistent masses.
Following the [ S] matrix are the mass and center of gravity locations.  These are the most commonly used
information of the GPWG output.  Because the mass may be different in the three translational directions,
the mass is printed for every coordinate direction.  For the same reason, the center of gravity location is given
for each of the three translational masses.  If the mass is the same in all directions, a unique center of gravity
exists and is located at the x-component of the y (or z) mass, the y-component of the x (or z) mass, and the
z-component of the x (or y) mass.  If the mass is not the same in all three directions, it is likely due to the x = -1 GPWG is skipped (default).
x = 0 The mass properties are computed relative to the origin of the basic coordinate system.
x &amp;gt; 0 The mass properties are computed relative to grid point x.  If grid point x does not exist, the
properties are computed relative to the basic coordinate system.

CONM1, CMASSi, or DMIG input.  If the reference point is specified with PARAM,GRDPNT,0 and [S]
is the identity matrix, then the center of gravity location is given in the basic coordinate system.  For the
example, the mass of the structure is 13.0 and the center of gravity location is (0.5384, 0.2307, 0.3846) in
the basic coordinate system.
If a grid point ID is used for the reference point, and [ S] is an identity matrix, then the center of gravity
location is in a coordinate system parallel to the basic coordinate system with an origin located at the grid
point.
If the [ S] matrix is equal to the identity matrix, then the [ I(S)] matrix represents the inertia matrix of structure
for the center of gravity with respect to the basic coordinate system, the [ I(Q)] matrix is the corresponding
principal moments of inertia matrix, and [ Q] represents the transformation from the principal directions to
the basic coordinate system.
The following additional comments on the GPWG should be noted.
The scale factor entered with parameter WTMASS  is applied to the assembled element mass before
the GPWG.  The GPWG module, however, converts mass back to the original input units that
existed prior to the scaling effect of the parameter WTMASS.  (Note:  The parameter WTMASS is
not applied to M2GG or M2PP input, but the M2GG mass is assembled into the mass matrix prior
to GPWG.  Therefore, for GPWG output only, the M2GG mass is scaled by the same parameter as
the element mass.  M2GG input may be scaled independently using the CM2 parameter.)
The GPWG is performed on the g-size mass matrix, which is the mass matrix prior to the processing
of the rigid elements, MPCs, and SPCs.
The mass at scalar points and fluid-related masses are not included in the GPWG calculation.
The GPWG for a superelement does not include the mass from upstream superelements.  Therefore,
the GPWG for the residual structure includes only the mass on the residual points.  The center of
gravity location is also based on the mass of the current superelement only. (Use WEIGHTCHECK
(Case) =YES to print the total mass for all Superelements.)
If a large mass is used for enforced motion, the large mass dominates the structural mass.  For model
checkout, it is recommended to remove the large mass and constrain the driving point.  A static
analysis is a convenient way to generate a mass matrix and obtain output from the GPWG.
The output from the GPWG is for information purposes only and is not used in the analysis.
Example with Direction-Dependent Masses
In the previous section, the mass was the same in each of the three coordinate directions thereby producing
a unique center of gravity location.  However, if scalar masses are used, the total mass may have different
properties in each direction, and the center of gravity may not be a unique location.  This effect is shown in
the output by providing the direction and center of gravity for each of the three mass principal components.
When using directional mass, the axes about which the inertia matrix  is calculated are referred to as the
principal mass axes .  The principal mass axes may not necessarily intersect.  However, these axes provide
uncoupled rotation and translation mass properties.  If the structural model is constructed using only physical
masses, the three principal mass values printed out are equal, the center of gravity is unique, and the principal
mass axes intersect at the center of gravity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;635 CHAPTER 19
Grid Point Weight Generator
Main Index
To demonstrate all of the features of the GPWG module, the four-mass sample problem discussed in the
previous section is modified so that the mass is not equal in each of the three translational directions (see
Figure 19-3). Furthermore, different displacement coordinate systems are used for the grid points.  The
displacement coordinate system for grid point 1 is the local rectangular system 1, which is oriented at an
angle of 45 degrees (about the zb axis).  The displacement coordinate system for grid point 3 is the local
rectangular system 3, which is oriented at an angle of 60 degrees (about the zb axis).  The grid point locations
and masses are summarized in Table 19-1.

User Warning Message 3042 is printed to inform you that inconsistent scalar masses were used.&lt;br&gt;
This message occurs because there are different scalar masses in the three components.  In general, if
you are using structural mass and/or CONM2s, you should not get this message.

The mass and center of gravity location shown are not in the basic coordinate system for this
example.  The mass and center of gravity are computed and printed in the principal mass coordinate
system.  This principal mass coordinate system should not be confused with the principal axes
discussed in most text books.  The principal mass axes in MSC Nastran are the axes that have no
coupling terms between the translational masses (diagonal translational mass matrix).  Also, the
MSC Nastran principal mass axes are not the axes of the inertia ellipsoid.  The [ S] matrix is the
transformation from the principal mass direction to the basic coordinate system.
This additional step may sound confusing, but it is necessary.  In real structures, the mass of
structure is generally the same in all directions, so there is no coupling between the translational
mass terms.  Since text books are written to solve real structural problems, there is no need to discuss
the principal mass axes, as they are called in MSC Nastran.  However, with MSC Nastran you are
not restricted to the same mass in each coordinate direction&amp;ndash;a situation that may not be physically
realizable but still is quite useful for certain modeling situations.  Therefore, the additional step of
computing principal mass axes is necessary.
If your model has the same mass in all coordinate directions, then the  matrix is the identity matrix
indicating that the principal mass axes is the basic coordinate system.  Always check the [ S] matrix.&lt;br&gt;
If it is not the identity matrix, verify that the mass distribution is correct.  Do not use the directional
mass and center of gravity location blindly.  Remember, these quantities are in the principal mass
axes.
To fully understand how the GPWG module works, it is useful to trace the steps MSC Nastran follows to
generate the output shown in Figure 19-4. The following shows the step-by-step procedure for the four mass
example.
1.The GPWG module uses the global mass matrix, which is the mass matrix before any constraints are
applied.  In this example, there are four grids, each with six degrees of freedom, resulting in a total of
24 degrees of freedom in the mass matrix.  The [ MJJ] matrix is shown in Figure 19-5.&lt;/p&gt;

Figure 19-5  Global Mass Matrix
The  matrix shows the mass contribution for each of the four grid points.  Note that the coordinate system
associated with rows and columns 1 through 6 (grid point 1) is coordinate system 1, the coordinate system
associated with rows and columns 13 through 18 (grid point 3) is coordinate system 3.  The remaining rows
and columns are in the basic coordinate system.
2.To generate the 6 x 6  rigid-body mass matrix  for the structure, it is necessary to compute the
mass matrix in the basic coordinate system relative to the reference point.  This computation requires
the transformation matrix  that relates the rigid-body displacements in the global system  to
the six unit displacements in the basic coordinate system located at the reference grid point  as
shown in Equation (19-1).

The transformation matrix  is assembled from the individual transformation matrices&lt;br&gt;
computed for each grid point.  Each individual transformation  matrix  consists of two
transformations: , which relates the location of the grid point to the reference grid point in the
basic coordinate system, and , which relates the global coordinate system at the grid point to
the basic coordinate system.
The  transformation matrices are first computed by constructing the location vectors in the
basic coordinate system  for each grid point in the model relative to the reference point as shown
in Equation (19-2).
(19-2)
The location vectors for the example are as follows:
(19-3)
Using the location vectors, the grid point transformation matrix  is computed for each grid
point by expanding the location vectors to a  matrix as shown in Equation (19-4).

Comparing the results shown in Equation (19-11) to  generated by the GPWG module
(Figure 19-4) shows the matrices to be numerically the same.
3.The next step is to inspect the  to determine whether the basic coordinate system can be used
as the principal mass directions.  The principal mass axes are axes that have no coupling between the
translational mass components.  For real structures, there is no coupling in the translational mass
terms in the inertia matrix.  However, with inconsistent scalar masses (CONM1, CMASSi, or
DMIG), you may define any type of mass matrix you desire.
To determine whether coupling exists between the translational mass terms,  is partitioned
into four  matrices as shown in Equation (19-12).
(19-12)
where the superscripts t and r refer to translation and rotation, respectively.
For this example, the translational mass partition is given by
(19-13)
A check is made for coupling as follows:
(19-14)
If  is greater than .001, then excessive coupling exists preventing the basic coordinate system
from being used for the principal mass directions and User Warning Message 3042 is printed.  For
this problem,  and .  The ratio

If needed, the principal mass directions are computed by performing an eigensolution with the
translational mass components.  The eigenvectors of  are the columns of the transformation
matrix .
(19-15)
Using this eigenvector matrix, the partitions of the rigid-body mass matrix with respect to the
principal mass direction are computed by Equation (19-16).
(19-16)
The  matrix for the example is given by
(19-17)
The  matrix is printed after the  matrix as shown in Figure 19-4. This represents the transformation
relating the basic coordinate system to the principal mass axes.  Again, if there is no coupling between
the translational mass component, which is the case for most problems, the eigensolution is not
required, and the  matrix is set equal to the identity matrix.  This example was selected to
demonstrate all of the features of the GPWG module, but it is not a typical problem.
4.The next step is to determine the principal masses and the center of gravity location in the principal
mass axes system as shown in Equation (19-18).

As can be seen, the center of gravity location is not a unique location.  The center of gravity location
is computed separately for the for x-, y-, and z-directions relative to the principal mass axes.  Only if
the mass is the same in each direction (which is typical) is there a unique center of gravity location,
which is relative to the reference point in the basic coordinate system.
For this example problem, the center of gravity locations are determined to be
The center of gravity location given in Table 19-2 is the same as shown in Figure 19-4.

6.The final step is to compute the principal moments of inertia and the principal directions of the
momental ellipsoid (commonly referred to as the principal axes in text books).  An intermediate
inertia matrix  is generated by reversing the sign on the off diagonal terms of .  This is
because historically, Nastran defined the off-diagonal terms with the opposite sign than most text
books. For the inertia matrix given in ,is given by

An eigensolution is performed on the  matrix to determine the principal directions.  The resulting
eigenvalues are the principal moments of inertia, which are assumed to be the diagonal terms of the
principal inertia matrix .  The eigenvectors form the columns of the matrix , which is
the transformation relating the intermediate inertia matrix  to the principal inertia matrix
as shown in Equation (19-22).

Multiple Mass Configuration
The multiple mass configurations (MMC) capability is described here which provides the user with a
convenient method for constructing and analyzing additional mass cases in MSC Nastran. This can be used,
for example, to analyze several different payloads or fuel loadings in a single run. The mass increments are
specified using the MASSID bulk data section. Mass combinations are then specified using MASSSET bulk
data entry. The mass combinations are subcase selectable to provide an appropriate method similar to
selecting SPCs and MPCs boundary conditions in a subcase to conduct the analysis using appropriate mass.
The complete discussion of the MMC capability is provided in the Multiple Mass Configuration  (Ch. 18) in the
MSC Nastran Dynamic Analysis User’s Guide . It should be noted that MMC capability does not support
inertia relief in SOL101 with part superelements.

Definition of Margin-of-Safety (M.S.):
The M.S. in tension is:  M.S.-T = (ST / S-MAX) - 1.0, where ST is the tension allowable given on
the MAT1 entry and S-MAX is the maximum stress given in the output, S-MAX = max (SA-MAX,
SB-MAX).  M.S. in tension is computed and printed if and only if ST is greater than zero and S-
MAX is greater than zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The M.S. in compression is:  M.S.-C = (-SC / S-MIN) - 1.0, where SC is compression allowable
given on the MAT1 card and S-MIN is the minimum stress given in the output, S-MIN = min (SA-
MIN, SB-MIN).  M.S. in compression is computed and printed if and only if SC is greater than zero
and S-MIN is less than zero.&lt;/p&gt;

is computed and printed if and only if ST is greater than zero and S-MAX is greater than zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The M.S. in compression is:  M.S.-C = (-SC / S-MIN) - 1.0, where SC is compression allowable
given on the MAT1 entry and S-MIN is the minimum stress given in the output.  An M.S. in
compression is computed and printed if and only if SC is greater than zero and S-MIN is less
than zero.&lt;/p&gt;

Notes:  This is standard STRESS output requested in Case Control Section.
Positive stress is tension.
Definition of Margin-of-Safety (M.S.):
The M.S. in tension is:  M.S.-T = (ST / S-MAX) - 1.0, where ST is the tension allowable given
on the MAT1 entry and S-MAX is the maximum stress given in the output.  M.S. in tension
is computed and printed if and only if ST is greater than zero and S-MAX is greater than
zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The M.S. in compression is:  M.S.-C = (-SC / S-MIN) - 1.0, where SC is compression
allowable given on the MAT1 entry and S-MIN is the minimum stress given in the output.&lt;br&gt;
M.S. in compression is computed and printed if and only if SC is greater than zero and S-
MIN is less than zero.&lt;/p&gt;

Definition of Margin-of-Safety (M.S.):
The M.S. in tension is:  M.S.-T = (ST / S-MAX) - 1.0, where ST is the tension allowable given on
the MAT1 entry and S-MAX is the maximum stress given in the output.  M.S. in tension is
computed and printed if and only if ST is greater than zero and S-MAX is greater than zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The M.S. in compression is:  M.S.-C = (-SC / S-MIN) - 1.0, where SC is compression allowable
given on the MAT1 entry and S-MIN is the minimum stress given in the output.  M.S. in
compression is computed and printed if and only if SC is greater than zero and S-MIN is less than
zero.&lt;/p&gt;

Definition of Margin-of-Safety (M.S.):
The M.S. is:  M.S. = (SS/MAX SHEAR) - 1.0, where SS is the shear allowable given on
the MAT1 entry and MAX SHEAR is the maximum shear stress given in the output.  M.S.
is computed and printed if and only if SS is greater than zero and MAX SHEAR is not
equal to zero.&lt;br&gt;

Main Index
A
Anisotropic Material
A material that has a different property in each direction at any given location in the structure.  There is no
material plane of symmetry associated with an anisotropic material.  This material can be described by 21
independent elastic constants in the stress-strain relationship.  See Homogeneous Material , Isotropic Material , and
orthotropic material .
Axisymmetric&lt;br&gt;
A type of finite element (or problem) in which the element’s cross section is symmetric about an axis of
rotation.  Used to model structures, such as shafts and rotationally-symmetric pressure vessels (which can be
geometrically represented as surfaces or solids of revolution). If material behavior and boundary conditions
have no variation in circumferential behavior then axisymmetric elements may be used. If there is a variation
in the circumferential direction, a Fourier series can be used to represent this and a Harmonic analysis is
performed.
B
Basic Coordinate System
MSC Nastran’s default, built-in rectangular coordinate system.  All user-defined (local) coordinate systems
ultimately must be able to be transformed back into the basic coordinate system.  The basic coordinate system
is often called the global coordinate system in many finite element programs and textbooks.  The global
coordinate system has a special meaning in MSC Nastran.  See also Global Coordinate System  and Local Coordinate
System .
Beam Orientation Vector
A user-defined vector  that is used to orient cross-sectional properties of CBAR and CBEAM elements with
respect to the model’s geometry.  This information defines a unique beam orientation relative to the model
geometry.
Bulk Data Section
The section of the MSC Nastran input (.dat) file containing model geometry, element connections and
properties, loads, constraints, and material properties.  This section follows the Case Control Section.
C
Case Control Section
The section of the MSC Nastran input (.DAT) file containing commands that select the type of analysis
output required (displacements, forces, stresses, etc.).  Case Control also manages sets of Bulk Data input
(e.g., loads and constraints) to be used in analysis subcases.  The Case Control Section follows the Executive
Control Section and precedes the Bulk Data Section.v&lt;/p&gt;

Comment Entry
An entry used to insert user-specified comments anywhere in the input (.dat) file.  The first character is a
dollar sign ($) in column 1, followed by any character.  When echoed, only the first 80 characters will be
printed in your .f06 file.
Composite Material
When two or more materials are combined together on a macroscopic scale.  Generally each of these materials
by itself may not provide the desired material properties for your design.  However, by combining these
materials into a composite material, the desired material properties may be obtained.  When speaking of
composites, most people think of fibrous composites (e.g., kevlar, graphite, etc.).  There are many other types
of composite that are encountered every day, such as plywood and steel reinforced concrete.  Also see
Anisotropic Material  and Orthotropic Material .
Computational Zero
See Machine Zero .
Consistent Load
The equivalent loads at the grid points computed from the applied loads on elements.  The same shape
function that is used in deriving the element stiffness and mass matrices is used for the derivation of the load-
hence the name “consistent load.”
Constraint
The enforcement of a particular displacement (translation and/or rotation) on a grid point or points.  The
boundary conditions of a static structure typically require a zero displacement constraint on various degrees
of freedom in the model.  Constraints may also be defined in terms of displacement with respect to other
degrees of freedom in the model or in terms of an enforced nonzero value of displacement.  Also see MPC and
SPC.
Continuation
An extension of an entry when the entry requires more than one line of input data.  Continuations may or
may not be required, depending on the particular Bulk Data entry and its options.  See Reference  6. for a
detailed description of the use of a continuation for specific Bulk Data entries.
Coordinate System
See the specific type ( Basic Coordinate System , Displacement Coordinate System , Global Coordinate System , Local
Coordinate System , Material Coordinate System , and Output File ).
CPU Time
Stands for central processing unit time.  The CPU time is a measure of the computational speed of your
computer.  Also see Elapsed Time , I/O Time , and Turnaround Time .&lt;/p&gt;

D
Data Block
Basic units used by MSC Nastran to store your data.  The data block can be a matrix or table.  As an example,
the g-set stiffness matrix is stored as the  data block; the  l-set stiffness matrix is stored as the  data
block.
.dat File
Also called the input file, the .dat file contains the complete MSC Nastran finite element model.  The input
file is submitted to MSC Nastran which then executes the analysis.  The input file contains the following
principal sections:
.DBALL File
A file created by running MSC Nastran that contains the permanent database.  By default, the extension
.DBALL is appended to the filename.  This database file is needed if you want to perform a restart.  See also
.MASTER File .  By default, all information pertaining to your model and solution is stored in this file.  See
Database Management  for ways of assigning this information to other files.
Decomposition
The first step in solving a system of linear equations, decomposition breaks the stiffness matrix [K] into lower
and upper triangular factors.  This process is one of the most computationally time-consuming steps in linear
static analysis.
Degrees-of-Freedom (DOFs)
The motion of each grid point can be described by three orthogonal translational and three orthogonal
rotational components of displacement.  Each component is called a degree of freedom and adds one
unknown to the system of simultaneous linear equations representing the structure.  Unlike a grid point, a
scalar point has only one (non-dimensional) degree-of-freedom associated with it.NASTRAN statement  Optional

Main Index
Delimiter
An entry in the MSC Nastran input (.DAT) file that indicates the beginning or end of a section.  CEND,
BEGIN BULK, and ENDDATA are required delimiters in all input files.
Differential Stiffness
The stiffness term resulting from the inclusion of the higher-order terms of the strain-displacement
relationships.  The differential stiffness softens the linear stiffness matrix in the case of a compressive axial
load and stiffens the linear stiffness matrix in the case of a tensile axial load.  The differential stiffness is often
called the geometric stiffness.
Discretization
The basic process of finite element modeling wherein a continuous structure is broken up-discretized-into
an assembly of individual elements.  The goal is to choose types and quantities of elements such that the
mathematical behavior of the model faithfully represents the behavior of the structure.  Properly discretizing
the structure requires both knowledge of the structure and engineering judgement.
Displacement Coordinate System
Each grid point may have a unique displacement coordinate system, as selected in field 7 (the CD field) of
the GRID Bulk Data entry.  Displacements, constraints, and other grid point-based quantities are calculated
and printed based on this coordinate system.  The basic coordinate system is MSC Nastran’s default
displacement coordinate system.
Displacement Method
A method of structural analysis in which displacements are the unknown quantities to be determined.  MSC
Nastran uses the displacement method.
DMAP
Acronym for Direct Matrix Abstraction Program.  DMAP is MSC Nastran’s high-level programming
language.  DMAP allows advanced users to access MSC Nastran’s internal modules to modify existing
solution sequences or to create customized solution methods. See the MSC Nastran DMAP Programmer’s Guide  for
further details.
DMAP Alters
A convenient method of providing you with a new analysis capability, increased efficiency, alternate solution
methods, additional printouts, and/or otherwise unavailable user conveniences.  A library of useful alters is
delivered with your delivery media (see the MSC Nastran Reference Guide  and the MSC Nastran DMAP Programmer’s
Guide  for further details). You can also create your own DMAP Alters to suit your need.
DOF(s)

E
Echo
A listing of the input file (.dat) written into the .f06 results file.  The input file can be unsorted (it appears
exactly like the .dat listing), sorted (it is alphabetized and comment entries removed), or both, as specified by
the ECHO Case Control Command.  This command can also be used to create a sorted copy of the whole
Bulk Data file.
Elapsed Time
Also known as the wallclock time.  The elapsed time is the time from the start of your job’s execution to the
end of the job.  This time includes the effect of your computer speed (CPU), the amount of memory available
on your machine, the I/O speed, and the swapping of multiple jobs on your machine.  See CPU Time , I/O Time ,
and Turnaround Time .
Element Coordinate System
Each element has an element coordinate system based on the element’s particular geometry and grid point
ordering sequence.  For many elements, quantities, such as element force and stress, are output in the element
coordinate system.
Elemental Stiffness Matrix
The stiffness matrix of an individual finite element, which is often denoted as [k].  The stiffness matrix
describes the element’s displacement response for a given load.  See also Global Stiffness Matrix .
Epsilon
A measure of numerical accuracy and roundoff error provided in the .f06 results file of linear static analysis
runs.  A small value of epsilon, approximately less than |10-9|, indicating a numerically stable problem.  A
large value of epsilon is evidence of numerical ill-conditioning.  An acceptable value may also be machine
dependent.  See also Ill-conditioning .
Executive Control Section
A required section of the input file that appears before the Case Control Section.  This section contains
requests for the solution sequence type (the SOL statement), the CPU time limits (the TIME statement), and
an optional identification entry (the ID statement).  User-provided DMAP Alters are also inserted in this
section.
F
.f04 File
A file created by running MSC Nastran that contains database information and the module execution
summary.  By default, the extension .f04 is appended to the filename.  The .F04 file is a valuable tool for
debugging and evaluating the performance of your run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;697 APPENDIX
Glossary

.f06 File
A file created by running MSC Nastran that contains the results of your analysis (e.g., stresses, forces,
displacements, etc.).  By default, the extension .f06 is appended to the filename.
Fatal Error
See User Fatal Message .
Fiber Direction
A term used when describing composite materials.  The fiber direction is commonly referred to as the
longitudinal direction or 1-direction.  This is the direction that possesses the highest strength for the fiber
composite material.  See Composite Material  and Matrix Direction .
File Management Section (FMS)
An optional input file section used primarily to attach or initialize MSC Nastran databases and FORTRAN
files.  The FMS section, if used, precedes the Executive Control Section.  This section is mostly used in
conjunction with large problems.
Finite Element
The basic building block of the finite element method.  Finite elements are the regularly, or nearly regularly,
shaped mathematical idealizations of simple structures (e.g., beams, plates, solids) with known mathematical
solutions.  When individual elements are combined to represent a complex irregular structure, the resulting
mathematical model approximates the behavior of the real structure.
Free Field Format
Input data format in which data fields are separated by commas or blanks.
G
Geometric Stiffness
See Differential Stiffness .
Global Coordinate System
The union of all the coordinate systems defined on all the CD fields on all the GRID entries.  The global
coordinate system in MSC Nastran is, therefore, not a single unique system.  Note that the basic coordinate
system may also, but not necessarily, be a part of the global coordinate system.  Many commercial finite
element programs and textbooks use the term “global coordinate system” to describe the coordinate system
that MSC Nastran calls its basic (default) coordinate system.  See also Basic Coordinate System , Displacement
Coordinate System , and Local Coordinate System .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Linear Statics Analysis User’s Guide 698
Main Index
Global Stiffness Matrix
The stiffness matrix of the entire structure.  The global stiffness matrix is an assembly of the elemental
stiffness matrices of individual elements in terms of the global coordinate system.  See also Elemental Stiffness
Matrix .
Grid Point
A geometric point that defines model geometry and provides a point to which finite elements are connected.&lt;br&gt;
Grid points are located in space with respect to a particular coordinate system and are displaced with the
loaded structure.  Analysis results, such as displacements and reaction forces, are reported at grid points.  The
basic equations of finite element analysis are written in terms of grid point displacement.
Grid Point Stress
A rational scheme to interpolate and/or extrapolate known element and vertex stresses over a surface or
volume (see Modeling Guidelines  for further details).
H
Hencky-von Mises Stress
See von Mises stress .
Homogeneous Material
A material that has the same property in all directions at all locations in the structure.  See Anisotropic Material ,
Isotropic Material , and Orthotropic Material .
I
Ill-conditioning
A system of linear equations is said to be ill-conditioned if small perturbations in the system lead to large
changes in the solution.  MSC Nastran checks for evidence of ill-conditioning in the system of equations
representing the structural model.  A high value of epsilon indicates a potential ill-conditioning problem.  Ill-
conditioning does not necessarily result in a fatal error but can result in inaccurate answers.  Possible causes
of ill-conditioning include a high difference in stiffness between adjacent elements in the model, unconnected
degrees of freedom, rigid body motion, or the presence of mechanisms.  See also Epsilon .

I/O Time
Stands for input/output time.  I/O time is the time it takes your computer to transfer data between different
locations in your computer during runtime (e.g., from memory to scratch disk).  See CPU Time , Elapsed Time ,
and Turnaround Time .
Isotropic Material
A material that has the same material property in all directions at a given location in a structure.  This
material can be defined by two independent elastic constants in the stress-strain relationship.  See Anisotropic
Material , Homogeneous Material , and Orthotropic Material .
L
Lamina
A term used to describe composites.  A lamina is a single layer consisting of a group of unidirectional fibers
(or sometimes woven fibers) arranged to form a flat plate or curved shell.  A lamina makes up the basic
building block of a two-dimensional composite element.
Laminae
More than a single lamina.
Laminate
A stack of laminae bonded together.  The principal direction of each lamina may be oriented in a different
direction to obtain the desired strength and stiffness properties.&lt;br&gt;
Large Field Format
Input format for Bulk Data entries in which the data fields are 16 columns wide, allowing numerical data to
have a greater number of significant digits.
Line Element
Elements, such as bars, rods, and beams.  A line element is typically connected by two grid points and is also
known as a one-dimensional (1-D) element.  One-dimensional elements do not imply that the elements can
only be used for a 1-D structure; rather, it can be used for a 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D structure.  An example of an
application of 1-D elements in a 3-D structure is the use of CBARs/CRODs for frames and stringers of
aircraft structures.
Linear Structure
A structure whose displacements are linearly proportional to the applied load.  Once the load is removed, the
structure returns to its original undeformed configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Linear Statics Analysis User’s Guide 700
Main Index
Load
A general term referring to forces, moments, pressure loads, thermal loads, electromagnetic loads, etc.  In
MSC Nastran analysis, loads are known quantities that are applied to the structural model.  MSC Nastran
then solves for the unknown displacements of the structure.
Local Coordinate System
A user-specified coordinate system that accommodates the input of geometry data or the reporting of analysis
results.  Local coordinate systems can be rectangular, cylindrical, or spherical, and are defined with respect to
the basic (default) coordinate system or another local coordinate system.  The only rule in MSC Nastran is
that the local coordinate system ultimately must be able to be transformed back into the basic coordinate
system.  See also Basic Coordinate System , Displacement Coordinate System , and Global Coordinate System .
.log File
A file created by running MSC Nastran that contains system information and system error messages.  By
default, the extension .LOG is appended to the filename.  You should always check this file if your job appears
to fail for no apparent reason.  This failure can result from such problems as insufficient disk space or that
the job was cancelled by the operator.  In many cases, the .LOG file provides you with a clue to the cause of
the problem.
M
Machine Zero
A value of zero with a small amount of computer roundoff error added.  In a typical structural model, a
number such as 1.2345E-12 may be considered a machine zero.  This term is also known as computational
or numeric zero.
.MASTER File
A directory file created by running MSC Nastran containing a list of all of the database sets used in your run,
an index pointing to all the data blocks created and where they are stored, and the NDDL.  By default, the
extension .MASTER is appended to the filename.  This file is needed if you want to perform restarts.  See
also NDDL  and .DBALL File .
Material Coordinate System
An optional coordinate system used to orient orthotropic or anisotropic material properties.  For isotropic
materials, a material coordinate system is not needed.&lt;br&gt;
Matrix Direction
A term used to describe composite materials.  Matrix direction is commonly known as the transverse direction
or 2-direction.  The matrix material by itself has very low strength; however, it holds the fibers together to
form a structure that produces a high strength to weight ratio (see Composite Material  and Fiber Direction ).&lt;/p&gt;

Mechanism
A mechanism occurs when part of a structure is capable of rigid body (strain-free) motion.  In linear static
analysis, the presence of a mechanism produces a singularity failure in the solution.
Mesh
The pattern formed by a collection of finite elements.  Relatively few elements result in a coarse mesh.&lt;br&gt;
Adding more elements produces a finer mesh, which can more closely represent an irregularly shaped
structure.  In general, a finer mesh is more accurate, but it is also more computationally expensive.
MPC
See Multipoint Constraint .
Multipoint Constraint
A convenient way to impose a linear relationship between two or more degrees of freedom.  Common
applications of the multipoint constraint include:  defining the relative motion between two grid points as a
degree of freedom or defining the average of the motions of several grid points as a degree of freedom.
N
NASTRAN Statement
An optional statement that, if used, appears at the beginning of the MSC Nastran input file.  The
NASTRAN statement is used to override the default values for certain operational parameters of the
program.  See Executing MSC Nastran  (p.1) in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide  for further information.
NDDL
Stands for MSC Nastran Data Definition Language and is the internal MSC Nastran language that descibes
the database.  The NDDL describes the content of the data blocks, checks whether data blocks and
parameters are permanently stored, and sets up dependency checks for efficient restarts.  Knowledge of the
NDDL is not required to use MSC Nastran efficiently.
Nonlinear (Geometric)
Structural displacements that are larger than those allowed by small displacement-based theory are said to be
geometrically nonlinear.  Large displacements require the use of special nonlinear solution sequences in MSC
Nastran (e.g., Solution 106).
Nonlinear (Material)
A material in which stress is not linearly proportional to strain, such as rubber.  When the load is removed,
your structure may not return to its original undeformed state.  Nonlinear materials require the use of special
nonlinear solution sequences in MSC Nastran (e.g., Solution 106).&lt;/p&gt;

Orthotropic Material
This is a special anisotropic material that can be used for plate and shell elements.  It contains three
orthogonal planes of material symmetry at a given location in the structure.  This material can be defined by
nine independent elastic constants in the stress-strain relationships.  See Anisotropic Material , Homogeneous
Material , and Isotropic Material .
Output File

P
PARAM,AUTOSPC
A parameter that controls the detection and constraint of obvious singularities in the model.&lt;br&gt;
PARAM,AUTOSPC is in operation by default in all solution sequences except for Solution 24.&lt;br&gt;
PARAM,AUTOSPC produces a grid point singularity table in the .f06 output file; this table lists the
singularities that were detected and constrained.  You should always check this singularity table to make sure
that it is your intention for these DOFs to be constrained.
Parameter
Parameters are used to request special program features and to input data relating to these features.&lt;br&gt;
Parameters are specified on PARAM Bulk Data entries and PARAM Case Control commands. A complete
listing of parameter functions is included in Parameters  (p.805) in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide .

Postprocessor
A graphics package that is designed to help you interpret and display your finite element results.  Common
postprocessing operations include x-y plots of numerical data, deformed shape plots of model geometry, and
color stress contour plots.
Preprocessor
A graphics package designed to help to create the finite element model.  Typical preprocessors create
geometry, create mesh elements, apply loads and constraints, and perform certain types of error checks.
R
Restart
A procedure that allows you to systematically continue from a previous analysis without re-doing your
problem from the beginning.
Results File
See the .f06 File .
Rigid Body Motion
Rigid body motion occurs when the structural model is free to displace in one or more directions
(displacement without strain).  A simple example of rigid body motion occurs when you move a pencil from
one location on your desk to another.  No strain occurs in the pencil-only translation and rotation as a rigid
body.  In static analysis, the possibility of rigid body motion due to an insufficiently constrained structure
results in a singularity in the stiffness matrix.  Consequently, the solution of the problem fails during
decomposition of the stiffness matrix.
Rigid Element
Also known as an R-type element.  The name “rigid” element is somewhat misleading since it includes both
rigid and interpolation elements.  Rigid elements consist of RBAR, RBAR1, RJOINT, RBE1, RBE2,
RROD, RTRPLT and RTRPLT1; these elements create a rigid connection between the connected degrees
of freedom.  Interpolation elements include the RBE3 and RSPLINE.  The RBE3 is often used to distribute
loads and mass.  The RSPLINE is often used to model mesh transition.
Rotation
Displacement about a coordinate axis.  A grid point has three rotational degrees of freedom, one about each
axis.  See also Degrees-of-Freedom (DOFs)  and Translation .
S
Scalar Point
A scalar point is defined by the SPOINT entry.  It is associated with only one degree of freedom and has no
geometric location associated with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Linear Statics Analysis User’s Guide 704
Main Index
Set
A collection or grouping of selective items in the MSC Nastran model.  It is primarily used for limiting the
amount of output data.
Single-Point Constraint (SPC)
The constraint of one or more degrees of freedom at a grid point, thereby enforcing displacement (often zero
displacement) of the grid point in the affected component directions.  For example, the grid point at the fixed
end of a cantilever beam is constrained (i.e., SPC’d) in all six DOFs.  Reaction forces, called forces of single-
point constraint (SPCF), may be recovered at these grid points.
Singularity
A mathematical condition prohibiting matrix inversion.  Consequently, the system of equations representing
the structure cannot be solved.  Common sources of singularities in linear static analysis include the presence
of unconnected or very weakly connected degrees of freedom or an inadequate prescription of constraints on
the model resulting in rigid body motion.
“Slowly Applied” Loads
A basic assumption of static analysis:  loads must be “slowly applied” so that no significant dynamic effects
are caused.
Small Displacements
A requirement of linear structural analysis.  Displacements must be sufficiently small enough so that they do
not violate certain mathematical assumptions inherent in the design of the finite elements used.  Large
displacements require nonlinear solution methods.
Small-Field Format
Input format for Bulk Data entries in which the data fields are eight columns wide.
Solid Element
Elements resembling bricks (eight corners), wedges (six corners), or tetrahedral (four corners).  Also called
three-dimensional elements.  Popular MSC Nastran solid elements include the CHEXA, CTETRA, and
CPENTA.
Solution Sequence
A prepackaged set of DMAP instructions designed to solve a particular type of engineering problem.  The
SOL command in the Executive Control Section is used to inform MSC Nastran which solution sequence
to use; for example, SOL 101 is used to specify linear static analysis.  See also DMAP .

Spring Element
An element representing a simple, single degree of freedom extensional or rotational spring.  Also called a
zero-dimensional element or scalar element.  The CELASi family of elements are spring elements.
Static
In the finite element sense, static means that the structural model is constrained to prevent rigid body motion
(static equilibrium exists) and that loads are assumed to be “slowly applied,” thereby inducing no dynamic
effects.
Stiffness Matrix
See Global Stiffness Matrix  and Global Stiffness Matrix .
Subcase
Subcases allow multiple individual load cases and/or multiple boundary conditions to be analyzed in the
same MSC Nastran run, thereby achieving greater computational efficiency than with separate runs.
Superelement Analysis
A very efficient method used by MSC Nastran to perform sub-structure analysis.&lt;br&gt;
Surface Element
Elements, such as thin plates (which are flat) or shells (which are curved).  Also called two-dimensional (2-
D) elements.  Popular MSC Nastran surface elements include the CQUAD4 (quadrilateral) and CTRIA3
(triangular) elements.  T wo-dimensional elements do not imply that the elements can only be used for a 2-
D structure; rather, it can be used for a 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D structure.  An example of the use of 2-D elements
in a 3-D structure is the use of CQUAD4s for modeling the panels of an automobile.
Symmetry
A geometric property in which a structure has one or more planes of symmetry.  Structural symmetry can be
exploited to produce a smaller model (appropriate constraints are used to model the boundary conditions on
the axis or axes of symmetry).  MSC Nastran contains a set of solutions sequences called cyclic symmetric
solution sequences that perform this task automatically (see Cyclic Symmetry , 555).
System Message
System Messages refer to diagnostics associated with program or system errors.  Analogous to User Messages.
T
Translation
Direct, linear displacement along a coordinate axis.  A grid point has three translation degrees of freedom,
one along each axis.  See also Degrees-of-Freedom (DOFs)  and Rotation .&lt;/p&gt;

Turnaround Time
The time from when you submit your job to when you obtain results.  T urnaround time includes the effect
of queuing at your computer site; therefore, it may be longer than the elapsed time.  See CPU Time , Elapsed
Time, and I/O Time .
Two-Dimensional (2-D) Element
See Surface Element .
U
User Fatal Message (UFM)
An MSC Nastran message describing an error severe enough to cause the program to terminate.  See the MSC
Nastran Reference Guide  for a complete listing of all of the UFMs.
User Information Message (UIM)
An MSC Nastran message that provides general information.  The issuance of an UIM is not necessarily
indicative of a problem.  MSC Nastran does not terminate due to an UIM.  See the MSC Nastran Reference Guide&lt;br&gt;
for a complete listing of all of the UIMs.
User Warning Message (UWM)
An MSC Nastran message warning of an atypical situation; the user must determine whether or not a
problem exists.  In general, MSC Nastran does not terminate due to an UWM.  See the MSC Nastran Reference
Guide  for a complete listing of all of the UWMs.
.usrobj File
A file created by running MSC Nastran that contains the object file of the user-written DMAPs.  By default,
the extension .USROBJ is appended to the filename.  This file can be deleted, and is deleted by default, if
you are not creating your own DMAP .
.usrsou File
A file created by running MSC Nastran that contains the source file of the user-written DMAPs.  By default,
the extension .USRSOU is appended to the filename.  This file can be deleted, and is deleted by default,  if
you are not creating your own DMAP .
V
von Mises Stress
This is a failure criteria commonly used for ductile materials.  This stress value is an invariant quantity that
is independent of the element coordinate system used; it is always a positive number.  For a general stress state
(nonprincipal axes), von Mises stress is given by the following equation:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;63 CHAPTER 3
Grid Points, Scalar Points, and Coordinate Systems
Main Index
In MSC Nastran, each grid point has six degrees of freedom: three translational and three rotational.  The
degrees of freedom are denoted as u1, u2, u3, 1, 2 and 3 or as T1, T2, T3, R1, R2, and R3.  T1, T2,
and T3 are the three orthogonal components of translation parallel to the 1, 2, and 3 directions of the grid
point’s displacement coordinate system, respectively.  R1, R2, and R3 are the components of rotation in the
same directions.
Field 8 of the GRID entry is known as the PS  field ( Permanent Single-Point Constraint) and may be used to
constrain any or all the degrees of freedom associated with the grid point.  These constraints are applied in
the output coordinate system, which is referred to as the CD  field (field 7), not the coordinate system that
you use to specify the grid point location in, which is referred to as the CP  coordinate system (field 3).  If
you are a new MSC Nastran user, it may seem strange to define your constraints in a different coordinate
system from the one your model was originally created in.  However, doing so can give you considerable
versatility in modeling a variety of joints and boundary conditions.
The output coordinate system that you specify in the CD  field is the coordinate system used to apply the
constraints, solve for the displacements, and output the results.  The CP field (field 3) is used only to define
the location of the grid point in space.
The constraints applied to the grid point using field 8 of the GRID entry are considered permanent because
they cannot be changed during the run.  Any degrees of freedom specified in the PS field are constrained for
all subcases.  In many situations, you want to analyze your structure using more than one set of constraints.&lt;br&gt;
For these situations, do not specify the constraints on the GRID entry.  Instead, specify the constraints using
an SPC  entry ( Single- Point Constraint) in the Bulk Data Section.  The only difference from using the GRID
entry is that constraints applied using an SPC entry must be selected through the Case Control Section and
therefore may be different for different subcases.  All constraints, whether they are applied with the use of an
SPC entry or using the PS field of the GRID entry, are applied in the output coordinate system.
As an example of the GRID entry, consider the truss structure discussed in Organization of MSC Nastran Files .&lt;br&gt;
The geometry of the structure is defined by the location of the four grid points. These locations are specified
in fields 4, 5, and 6 of the GRID entry with respect to the basic coordinate system. The basic coordinate
system is the default coordinate system for both the CP and CD fields of the GRID entry. In this example,
both the CP and CD fields are left blank so that the geometry is defined in the basic coordinate system and
the displacement results are output in the basic coordinate system. Note, the units of translation are the same
as the units of length of the model and the rotations are in units of radians.
You are not confined to using the basic coordinate system for the CP or CD fields; they may be any user-
defined coordinate system, which is commonly referred to as a local coordinate system. The CP and CD
fields may reference the same coordinate system if you like, but it is not a requirement. It is quite common
to use a local coordinate system to input the geometry (using the CP field) and obtain your output in the
basic system (leave the CD field blank or use a 0). The local coordinate systems may be rectangular,
cylindrical, or spherical. All of the coordinate systems are discussed in Coordinate Systems .
Scalar Points
A scalar point  can be used whenever you need a single degree of freedom in your model.  A scalar point has
only one degree of freedom, not six as in the case of a grid point. A scalar point does not have a location in
space, so it does not require a coordinate system. Common uses for scalar points include meshing models&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Linear Statics Analysis User’s Guide
Coordinate Systems64
Main Index
with scalar elements, computing relative and average motions, and defining the warping coefficients of a thin-
walled beam.
In general, a grid point can be used as a scalar point.  However, a grid point requires more input and requires
you to constrain five of the six degrees of freedom.  From an input point of view, it is more efficient to use
scalar points when you need only a single degree of freedom.  Furthermore, using scalar points is more
efficient computationally than using a grid point with five of its six components constrained.
Scalar points are defined with the Bulk Data entry SPOINT  in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide as
shown.  You can specify up to eight scalar points on a single SPOINT entry.  Scalar points can also be defined
implicitly when you use scalar elements.
The format of the SPOINT entry is as follows:
SPOINT
Examples of the use of scalar points are provided in MSC Nastran Elements .
Coordinate Systems
Whenever you create a model using MSC Nastran, you must generate a set of grid points which, together
with the elements, define the size and shape of your model.  In Grid Points , the location of the grid point is
defined by three components (Fields 4, 5, and 6 of the GRID entry).  However, when you define a location
of the grid point in space using these components, you are inherently defining the point relative to a
coordinate system.  In the examples presented in Organization of MSC Nastran Files , the grid points are defined in
the basic coordinate by default.  The basic coordinate system is a rectangular coordinate system implicitly
defined in all MSC Nastran finite element models.
You will often find it convenient to model your structure or part of your structure in a coordinate system
other than the basic coordinate system.  For example, if you are modeling a cylindrical pressure vessel pressure
with spherical ends, then you choose a cylindrical coordinate system most convenient for the body of the
vessel and a spherical coordinate system most convenient for the ends.  The cylindrical  and spherical
coordinate systems  are referred to as local coordinate systems.  Another common example where you may
wish to use local coordinates is when you are modeling structures with multiple components.  By defining
the components with their coordinate system, you can use dimensions directly from the drawings without
having to convert the locations of the grid points  to a common origin.  Furthermore, when the components
have their own coordinate system, their location and orientation may be changed by modifying the
coordinate system entry, thereby minimizing the need for remeshing
The examples above are just two of the many reasons for using local coordinate systems to define your model.&lt;br&gt;
Before you start to create your model, keep in mind that prudent use of local coordinate systems can simplify
the initial model generation and future model changes.SPOINT ID1 ID2 ID3 ID4 ID5 ID6 ID7 ID8

&lt;p&gt;65 CHAPTER 3
Grid Points, Scalar Points, and Coordinate Systems
Main Index
To specify the coordinate system for the location of the grid point, you enter the ID of that coordinate system
in the CP  field (Field 3) of the GRID entry.  These local coordinate systems may be rectangular, cylindrical,
or spherical.  If the CP field is left blank, the grid point is defined in the basic coordinate system.
The ID of the basic coordinate system is 0; hence, entering a 0 in the CP field produces the same results as
leaving the field blank.  The local coordinate systems are identified by a positive integer ID.  All local
coordinate systems must directly or indirectly be defined in terms of the basic coordinate system.  An example
is presented later in this section.
It is very important to understand that the coordinate system identified in the CP field is used to define the
location of the gird point.  The grid point results (displacement, grid point forces, etc.) are generated and
output in the coordinate system defined by the CD  field of the GRID entry (Field 7).  Since the CD field
identifies the coordinate system in which the output quantities are output, it is often called the output
coordinate system or the displacement coordinate system.
(For convenience, it is common to use a local coordinate system to generate the model but have the results
displayed in the basic coordinate system.)  In this case, you enter the ID of the local coordinate system in the
CP field and leave the CD field blank.  If, on the other hand, you need to output the displacement
information in particular coordinate system, you enter the ID of that local coordinate system in the CD field.&lt;br&gt;
For many practical modeling situations, you may have several different output coordinate systems in a model.&lt;br&gt;
It is conceivable that every grid point in your model can have a different output coordinate system; however,
the output may be difficult to interpret.
To aid the output interpretation, the user defined output coordinate system ID, on field 7 (CD) of GRID
entry, can be printed along with the responses for most vector requests by adding CID, such as
DISP(CID)=ALL to the request.  The CID will only be printed in the .f06 output file, all other output files
are unchanged. A CID keyword in the output request(s) need(s) only to appear once in the Case Control
Section. It will affect ALL grid point related output, such as DISPlacement, VELOcity, ACCEleration,
OLOAD, SPCForce and MPCForce
Although the CD field is referred to as the displacement coordinate system, it is much more than just the
coordinate system used to output the results.  In fact, it has a much more fundamental role in MSC Nastran.&lt;br&gt;
The collection of all the output coordinate systems -that is, all the coordinate systems defined on the CD field
of all the grid points-constitutes the global coordinate system.  It is important to note that the global
coordinate system is not necessarily a single coordinate system but rather the collection of all of your CD
coordinate systems.  The global stiffness matrix is assembled in the global system.
The concept of a global stiffness matrix was introduced in the example in Introduction .  All of the degrees of
freedom in your model are assembled into the global stiffness matrix.  Remember, the global coordinate
system is not a unique coordinate system but rather the collection of all the CD coordinate systems specified
on all of the GRID entries.  Therefore, the output coordinate system that you specify in the CD field for a
particular grid point is the coordinate system used to apply the constraints, solve for the displacements, and
output the results associated with that grid point.  Since it is very important that you understand the
significance of the MSC Nastran global stiffness matrix , it is useful to discuss how the definition of
coordinate systems in MSC Nastran differs from the classical textbook approach.
Many finite element textbooks refer to a “global coordinate system,” but this term means something entirely
different in MSC Nastran.  The global coordinate system referred to by most textbooks is actually the basic
coordinate system in MSC Nastran.  These differences in terminology often confuse new users who have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Linear Statics Analysis User’s Guide
Coordinate Systems66
Main Index
taken a finite element class or have used other FEA programs.  It is important to understand the MSC Nastran
definition of the global coordinate system.
If you are a new user and have a background in FEA, there is a significant difference between the way MSC
Nastran defines its global coordinate system versus the way it is defined in most textbooks.  The classical
textbook approach is to generate the element stiffness matrices for all the elements and then transform these
stiffness matrices into a unique common coordinate system called the global coordinate system.  These
individual elemental stiffness matrices are assembled into a single stiffness matrix commonly referred to as
the global stiffness matrix.  Each row and column of this global stiffness matrix represents a degree of freedom
of the structural model.  The coordinate system associated with each one of these degrees of freedom is the
same.
Now consider what MSC Nastran does.  MSC Nastran generates the element stiffness matrix  in a similar
manner as that used in the classical approach.  However, instead of transforming the element stiffness matrices
into a unique coordinate system, these matrices are transformed into the coordinate system specified in the
CD field for the grid points where the element is attached.  The individual elemental stiffness matrices are
then assembled to form the global stiffness matrix.  However, the coordinate systems associated with the
degrees of freedom in the MSC Nastran global stiffness matrix may be different.  This approach opens the
door to a variety of elegant modeling techniques.  If you prefer to have the global coordinate system be the
same as the basic coordinate system, which is a unique system, you can leave the CD field blank for all the
grid points in the model.
As can be seen, local coordinate systems play an important role in generating your models, solving for the
solution, and displaying the results.  The next section shows how to define a local coordinate system.
User-Defined Coordinate Systems
There are two methods to define a coordinate system.  The first method (Method 1) is to define the location
of the new coordinate system by referencing three grid points.  The Bulk Data entries for this method are
CORD1R (rectangular), CORD1C (cylindrical), and CORD1S (spherical).
The second method of defining a coordinate system is by specifying the location of three points.  The Bulk
Data entries for the second method are CORD2R (rectangular), CORD2C (cylindrical), and CORD2S
(spherical).
In Method 2 the new coordinate system is defined in terms of an existing coordinate system, which may, or
may not be the basic coordinate system.  A word of caution:  if this reference coordinate system is modified,
the new local coordinate system is also modified.  Similarly, if a new coordinate system is defined using
Method 1 and the reference grid points are moved, the orientation of the new coordinate system is also
changed.  This problem is illustrated in a later example.
CORD1R  and CORD2R
Defining a rectangular coordinate with the Bulk Data entry CORD1R  in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference
Guide requires three reference grid points:  G1, G2, and G3.  Referring to Figure 3-1, grid point G1 defines
the origin of the coordinate system.  A vector taken from G1 to G2 defines the Z-axis.  Grid point G3,
together with this Z-axis, defines the XZ plane.  The X-axis is defined to be in this XZ plane and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;67 CHAPTER 3
Grid Points, Scalar Points, and Coordinate Systems
Main Index
perpendicular to the Z-axis.  Finally, the Y-axis is generated from the X- and Z-axes using the right-hand rule.&lt;br&gt;
The format of the CORD1R is as follows:
CORD1R
The Bulk Data entry CORD2R  in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide uses the locations of three points A,
B, and C in the same manner as the three grid points used for the CORD1R entry.  These points are defined
in space using coordinates relative to a reference coordinate system (Field 3).  The reference coordinate
system must be independently defined.  The format of the CORD2R is as follows:

Figure 3-1  CORDIR and CORD2R Definitions
To better understand the use of a CORD1R entry, consider the truss structure introduced in Organization of
MSC Nastran Files .  The input file is modified so that the location of grid points 1 through 4 are defined in a
rectangular coordinate system with an ID of 11 as shown in Figure 3-2.
Figure 3-2  Grid Point Locations Using a Local Coordinate System
The new rectangular coordinate system with an ID of 11 has an origin located at the center of the truss and
is rotated 180 degrees about the basic Z-axis.
Part of the corresponding input file for the structure is given in Listing 3-1.  (See
MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/truss6.dat) Note that it is necessary to add three additional grid points to the
input file.  Grid point 11 is located at the center of the truss structure, but it is not attached to the structure z

and is fully constrained.  Grid point 12 is located 10 inches above grid point 11 in the basic Z-direction.  The
Z-axis for the new coordinate system is therefore parallel to the basic Z-axis.  The choice of 10 inches is
arbitrary since any positive value produces the same results.  Grid point 13 defines the local XZ plane from
which the X- and Y-axes of coordinate system 11 are determined.  The choice of 0 inches for the X location
of grid point 13 is also somewhat arbitrary since it is used only to define the XZ plane&amp;ndash;any real number less
than 300 inches produces the same results.  If the X-component of grid point 13 is greater than 300 inches,
then the X-axis will be in the basic X-direction instead of the direction shown.

It is important to note that grid point 11 is not attached to the structure in any way, although it occupies the
same physical space as the structure shown in Figure 3-2.  The addition of the three grid points 11, 12, and
13 does not affect the stiffness of the structure.  It is also important to note that the input file shown in
Listing 3-1 defines the same structure as shown in Listing 2-2.  Since the CD field of grid points 1, 2, 3, and 4
are the same in both files, the displacement output of the two files will be the same.
The above example demonstrates the Method 1 approach (using grid points instead of vectors) to define a
local coordinate system.  For this example, three additional grid points are added to the model and are fully
constrained.  The next example also shows the Method 1 approach, but the three existing grid points are used
instead of defining three new ones.
Consider the truss structure shown in Figure 3-3.  Suppose you want the positive T1 component of the
displacements for all the grid points to be in the negative Xb-direction as shown in Figure 3-3(a).  Therefore,
you define a new coordinate system and arbitrarily give it an ID of 11.  It is convenient to generate the new
coordinate system using Method 1 with grid points 2, 4, and 1.  The coordinate system 11 is entered in the
CD field of all the grid points.  These grid points already exist in the model; however, if you use them, you&lt;/p&gt;

may experience potential problems as shown in this example.  The model was submitted using the existing
grid points to define local coordinate system 11.  After inspecting the results, everything appears to be fine.
Then you decide that the model needs to be modified.  The change consists of moving the location of grid
point 4 as shown in Figure 3-3 (b).  You view the model using your graphics preprocessor.  Again, everything
looks fine, so you submit the model for another MSC Nastran analysis.
However, in the process of moving grid point 4, you also inadvertently rotate the local coordinate system 11.&lt;br&gt;
When you look at the model using your graphics postprocessor, the deformed shape seems acceptable.&lt;br&gt;
However, the output shown in the output file is not in the direction you want.  Why did this problem fail to
appear on the preprocessor?  The reason is that most postprocessors transform the results from the output
coordinate system into their own screen coordinate system.  If you are like many users, you check the overall
results using the postprocessor, but if you need a displacement at a specific location, you review the output
file.  In this case, you were misled by failing to note that your model’s coordinate orientation changed.
Figure 3-3  Model Change
To avoid this type of problem when using Method 1, the recommendation is to define three fully constrained
grid points that are not part of the structure.  Then if the model is modified, the local coordinate system
remains unchanged.
CORD1C  and CORD2C
The Bulk Data entry CORD1C  in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide  is used to define a cylindrical
coordinate system using three grid points to define its location and orientation in space as shown in Figure 3-4.
Grid point G1 defines the origin of the cylindrical system. A vector from grid point G1 to grid point G2
defines the Z-axis. Grid point G3 together with the Z-axis defines the  = 0 plane. The format of the
CORD1C is as follows:

Coordinate system 1 is a cylindrical coordinate system  defined using a CORD2C  entry.  This coordinate
system describes the body of the silo and is defined with respect to the basic coordinate system.  The origin
is given by point A1, and located by the vector (100,0,0) as shown in Figure 3-6.  The Z-axis is defined by the
line extending from point A1 to point B1, which is located at (100,1,0).  The Z-axis along with point C1,
which is located at (101,1,0), defines the  = 0 plane.  The R-axis is defined in this plane and is perpendicular
to the Z-axis.  The direction of the -axis is determined using the right-hand rule.
The spherical coordinate system  with an ID of 2 is defined in terms of coordinate locations with respect to
the reference coordinate system 1.  The location of origin of the spherical coordinate system 2 is given by
point A2 at (0,0,50).  This location is with respect to coordinate system 1.  The  = 0 axis is the line extending
from A2 to B2, which is located at (0,0,51).  Finally, the = 0 plane is located by the = 0 axis and point C2,
which is located at (1,0,51).
Since coordinate system 1 is defined in terms of the basic coordinate system, coordinate system 2 is also
indirectly defined in terms of the basic coordinate system.  It is also acceptable to define both coordinate
systems directly in terms of the basic coordinate system (use whichever method is most convenient for you).&lt;br&gt;
However, since coordinate system 2 is linked to coordinate system 1, adjusting the position of the silo (for
example, due to a model change) is only a matter of changing the locations of the grid points on the
CORD2C entry.
The Element  and Material Coordinate System
Every element in the MSC Nastran library has its own unique element coordinate system that is used to
output the element forces, moments, and stresses as well as to orient section properties.  For some elements,
such as the CROD element, the element coordinate systems are implicitly defined based on the element
connectivity.  For other elements, you must explicitly define the orientation of the element coordinate system.&lt;br&gt;
For further discussion of element coordinate systems, refer to MSC Nastran Elements .
In addition to the element coordinate system, an element may also have an optional material coordinate
system that can be used to define the orientation of orthotropic or anisotropic material.  See Material Properties
and Composites  for a discussion of material coordinate systems.Listing 3-2  Grain Silo Coordinate Systems

Main Index
Introduction to MSC Nastran Elements
The MSC Nastran element library consists of numerous elements that can be categorized as scalar, one-
dimensional (1-D), two-dimensional (2-D), three-dimensional (3-D), general and connectors. Before
discussing the elements, it is useful to define each of the these categories, which elements fall into each
category, and how the categories are used in a general sense.
Scalar Elements
Scalar elements, also referred to as zero-dimensional elements, consist of the springs, masses, and viscous
dampers. For static analysis, the scalar spring is the most commonly used scalar element. The scalar mass
elements are used less frequently; however, they are useful when you need to model a concentrated mass in
one direction. The scalar dampers are not used in static analysis. All of the scalar elements are defined between
two degrees of freedom in your model or between one degree of freedom and ground.
The scalar elements do not derive their stiffness from physical properties; you define the stiffness directly. For
example, in the CROD elements used in Organization of MSC Nastran Files  and Grid Points, Scalar Points, and
Coordinate Systems , the axial stiffness is computed by MSC Nastran using the cross-sectional area entered on
the PROD entry, the modulus of elasticity defined on the MAT1 entry, and the location of the grid points
to which the CROD is connected.  If you want to use scalar spring elements instead of the CROD element,
you connect the appropriate degrees of freedom and enter the spring rate for each of the springs.
The scalar elements used in static analysis consist of the following:
CELAS1 , CELAS2 , CELAS3 , CELAS4 , CBUSH  - Scalar Spring Elements
CMASS1 , CMASS2 , CMASS3 , CMASS4  - Scalar Mass Elements
One-Dimensional Elements
A one-dimensional element is one in which the properties of the element are defined along a line or curve.&lt;br&gt;
Typical applications for the one-dimensional element include truss structures, beams, stiffeners, and many
others.  In fact, the truss structure used in Organization of MSC Nastran Files  and Grid Points, Scalar Points, and
Coordinate Systems  was modeled using CROD elements which are considered one-dimensional elements.  A
truss example was used to introduce MSC Nastran because the CROD element is the simplest of all the
structural elements.  A list of the one-dimensional elements discussed in this chapter includes
CROD  - An element with axial stiffness and torsional stiffness about the axis for the element.
CBAR  - A straight prismatic element with axial, bending, and torsional stiffness.
CBEAM  - An element similar to the CBAR but with additional properties, such as variable cross-
section, shear center offset from the neutral axis and others.
CBEND  - A curved element capable of internal pressure.
CBEAM3 - A three noded curved element for modeling with higher order elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;77 CHAPTER 4
MSC Nastran Elements
Main Index
Two-Dimensional Elements
Two-dimensional elements, commonly referred to as plate and shell elements, are used to represent areas in
your model where one of the dimensions is small in comparison to the other two.  As shown in Figure 4-1, the
thickness is substantially less than dimensions a or b.
Figure 4-1  Typical Plate Element
In the finite element field, the membrane stiffness of the two-dimensional elements can be  calculated using
one of two theories:  “plane stress” or “plane strain.”  In the plane strain theory, the assumption is made that
the strain across the thickness t is constant.  Note that a two-dimensional element can be in either plane stress
or plane strain, but not both.  By default, the commonly used linear two-dimensional elements in MSC
Nastran are plane stress elements.  The exception is the CSHEAR element which does not have inplane
membrane stiffness and the CRAC2D, in which you must define whether the element is a plane stress or
plane strain element.  The plane strain formulation is specified using the PSHELL and PRAC2D entries.
Each of these two formulations, plane stress and plane strain, is applicable to certain classes of problems.  If
you are not familiar with the plane stress and plane strain theories, you probably need to use the plane stress
formulation (the default).  Most thin structures constructed from common engineering material, such as
aluminum and steel, can be modeled effectively using plane stress.  In other words, unless you have reason
not to do so, use the plane stress formulation.
The two-dimensional elements that are discussed in this chapter are
CSHEAR  - A shear panel element, i.e., the element can transmit inplane shear forces only.
CQUAD4 , CTRIA3  - General-purpose plate elements capable of carrying inplane force, bending
forces, and transverse shear force.  This family of elements are the most commonly used 2-D
elements in the MSC Nastran element library.
CQUAD8 , CTRIA6  - Higher order elements that are useful for modeling curved surfaces with less
elements than are required if you used the CQUAD4 and CTRIA3 elements.  In general, the
CQUAD4 and CTRIA3 elements are preferred over the CQUAD8 and CTRIA6 elements.
CQUADR  and CTRIAR  - This family of 2-D elements are complementary to the CQUAD4 and
CTRIA3 elements.
CRAC2D  - A element used to model surfaces with a discontinuity due to a crack.ab

Introduction to MSC Nastran Elements78
Main Index
Three-Dimensional Elements
Whenever you need to model a structure that does not behave as a bar or plate structure under the applied
loads, you need to use one or more of the three-dimensional elements. The three-dimensional elements are
commonly referred to as solid elements. Typical engineering applications of solid elements include engine
blocks, brackets, and gears.
Three-dimensional elements that are discussed in this chapter include
CHEXA , CPENTA , CPYRAM  and CTETRA - General-purpose solid elements. This family of
elements is recommended for most solid model applications.
The CTRIAX6  - A axisymmetric solid of revolution element. This element is used only in
axisymmetric analysis.
CRAC3D  - A element used to model solids with a discontinuity due to a crack.
GENEL Element
The GENEL element is a way to input our own element, usually based on test data. It is really not an element
in the same sense as the CBAR or CQUAD4 element. There are no properties explicitly defined and no data
recovery is performed The GENEL element is used to describe a substructure that has an arbitrary number
of connection grid points or scalar points.
Connector Elements
MSC Nastran offers various ways of modeling structural connections and fasteners. Spot welds, seam welds,
bolts, screws, and so on can be represented, depending on the modeling goals.The Connector family of
elements enables you to connect surfaces with differing mesh densities and using a subset of spot weld
elements you can connect more than one element per surface. The Connector elements are general in purpose
and always satisfies the condition of rigid body invariance.The Connector elements discussed in this chapter
include:
CWELD - which defines a weld or fastener connecting two surface patches or points
CFAST - which defines a fastener with material orientation connecting two surface patches
CSEAM -which defines a seam line to connect two surface patches
CINCT - which connects dissimilar meshes along the edges of finite element mesh subdomains
As a final comment on all of the elements, the purpose of this chapter is to discuss the commonly used
elements and their applications to typical engineering problems.  The elements are discussed in order of their
size in terms of the number of degrees-of-freedom &amp;ndash;they are not discussed in order of importance.  Do not
assume that the CBAR is more useful or preferred over a CQUAD4, for instance, because it is discussed first.&lt;br&gt;
The only exception to this are the scalar elements, which are discussed after the three-dimensional elements.&lt;br&gt;
This order is chosen because the scalar elements are used less frequently than the other elements.
Also note that the discussion in this chapter is limited to isotropic material properties, i.e., properties that can
be described using a MAT1 entry.  Non-isotropic and composite material properties are the subject of Material
Properties and Composites .&lt;/p&gt;

Scalar Elements
The CELASi Elements
A scalar element is an element that connects two degrees of freedom in the structure or one degree of freedom
and ground.  The degrees of freedom may be any of the six components of  a grid point or the single
component of a scalar point.  Unlike the one-, two- and three-dimensional elements that are discussed in the
previous sections, the scalar element lacks geometric definition.  Hence, scalar elements do not have an
element coordinate system.
Scalar elements are commonly used in conjunction with structural elements where the details of the physical
structure are not known or required. Typical examples include shock absorbers, joint stiffness between
linkages, isolation pads, and many others. Whenever scalar elements are used between grid points, it is highly
recommended that the grid points be coincident. If the grid points are noncoincident, any forces applied to
the grid point by the scalar element may induce moments on the structure, resulting in inaccurate results.
For static analysis, the linear scalar springs (CELASi , i = 1-4) and concentrated masses  (CMASSi, i =1-4) are
useful. There are four types of scalar springs and mass definitions. The formats of the CELASi entries, i.e.,
CELAS1  in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide  (elastic springs) are as follows:

Scalar Elements80
Main Index
Type one scalar elements (CELAS1, CMASS1) can reference both grid and scalar points. The element
connectivity entry defines an ID of an appropriate property entry, similar to the CROD entry introduced in
Organization of MSC Nastran Files . T ype two scalar elements (CELAS2, CMASS2) can also connect to both grid
and scalar points; however, the property definition is on the element entry itself. T ypes three and four are
equivalent to types one and two, respectively, except they can only reference scalar points. If a model consists
of many scalar elements connected only to scalar points, it is more efficient to use these two latter types. The
format of the PELAS  entry is as follows:

This example is used only to demonstrate the use of the scalar element.  In general, you do not replace
structural elements with scalar springs.  If this were an actual structure being analyzed, the preferred method
would be to use CROD elements.  The resulting output listing for this model is given in Figure 4-3.

The displacement vector output also includes the displacement results for the scalar points.  Since a scalar
point has only one degree of freedom, MSC Nastran displays up to six scalar points displacements per line.&lt;br&gt;
For the output shown in Figure 4-3, the displacement of scalar points 1, 2, and 3 are labeled T1, T2, and T3,
respectively.  The POINT ID of 1 is the ID of the first scalar point in that row.  The TYPE “S” indicates that
all the output in that row is scalar point output.
The sign convention for the scalar force and stress results is determined by the order of the scalar point IDs
on the element connectivity entry.  The force in the scalar element is computed by Equation (4-1).
FSPRING  = K(U1 - U2) (4-1)
For the equivalent spring model, the force in element 1 is found to be

This result agrees with the force shown in Figure 4-3.  If you reverse the order of SPOINT ID 1 and 2 in the
CELAS2 entry for element 1, the force in the spring will be
3.75  105  (0.001698 - 0.0)  = 636.7  lb
Neither answer is wrong-they simply follow the convention given by Equation (4-1).
The same structure modeled with two CROD elements is in the input file rod1.dat. (See
MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/rod1.dat)
The BUSH Element
The CBUSH element is a generalized spring-damper element. Unlike the CELASi, elements the CBUSH is
a structural scalar element. It connects two non coincident grid points, or two coincident grid points or one
grid point and has an associated PBUSH entry. Also if, CELASi elements are used and the geometry is not
aligned properly, internal constraints may be induced. The CBUSH contains all the features of the CELASi
elements plus avoiding the internal constraint problem.
The format of the Bulk Data entry CBUSH  is as follows:

Remarks:
1.Element identification numbers should be unique with respect to all other element identification
numbers.
2.Figure 4-4 shows the bush element geometry.
3.CID &amp;gt;0 overrides GO and Xi.  Then the element x-axis is along T1, the element y -axis is along T2,
and the element z -axis is along T3 of the CID coordinate system.  If the CID refers to a cylindrical
coordinate system or a spherical coordinate system, then grid GA is used to locate the system.  If for
cylindrical or spherical coordinate, GA falls on the z -axis used to define them, it is recommended that
another CID be selected to define the element x -axis.
4.For noncoincident grids ( GA ≠ GB), when GO or (X1, X2, X3) is given  and no CID is specified, the

10. When CID &amp;gt;0, the element x-axis is set as in Remark 3. This means that the element force is always
computed as  Ke . (UB-UA) ; if UA&amp;gt;UB , a compressive force will result. This is unlike the GO or Xi
options, where relative positive elongation in tension and relative negative elongation is compression.
11. The CBUSH element is designed to satisfy rigid body equilibrium requirements. For noncoincident
grids, internal rigid links connect the bush location to the grid locations. This results in coupling
between translational and rotational degrees-of-freedom at the grids even when no rotational springs
or dampers are specified on the PBUSH.

The following example demonstrates the use of the CBUSH element as a replacement for scalar element for
static analysis. The analysis joins any two grid points by user-specified spring rates, in a convenient manner
without regard to the location or the displacement coordinate systems of the connected grid points. This
method eliminates the need to avoid internal constraints when modeling.
The CBUSH elements are easier to model since they connect grid points instead of grid point components.
To illustrate the difference, the model shown in Figure 4-6 (see MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/bushweld.dat)
has two sheets of metal modeled with CQUAD4 elements. The sheets are placed next to each other.  There
are grid points at the common boundary of each sheet of metal, which are to be joined together.  The edge
opposite the joined edge of one of the sheets is constrained to ground.  The grid points at the boundary are
slightly misaligned between the two sheets due to manufacturing tolerances.  There is a nominal mesh size
of 2units between the grid points, with 10 elements on each edge.  The adjacent pairs of grid points are
displaced from each other in three directions inside a radius of 0.1 units in a pattern that maximizes the offset
at one end, approaches zero at the midpoint, and continues to vary linearly to a maximum in the opposite
direction at the opposite end.
The boundary is modeled and loaded on the CELAS elements in the first subcase and on the CBUSH
elements in the second subcase.
A static loading consisting of a point load with equal components in all three directions on the center point
opposite the constrained edge is applied.  The first loading condition loads only the CELAS model and the
second loading condition loads only the CBUSH model, allowing comparison of the response for both
models in one combined analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

Figure 4-6  CELAS2 vs CBUSH Comparison Model
In order to use CELASi elements properly, it is necessary to account for the offsets between the grid points.&lt;br&gt;
The most practical method may be to define coordinate systems, which align with a line between each pair
of grid points, and then input the CELASi elements along these coordinate systems, which is a tedious, error-
prone task.  If the grid points are located in non-Cartesian systems or several Cartesian coordinate systems,
the task is even more tedious and error prone.  Such small misalignment errors are ignored in this model, and
the CELAS2 elements are input in the basic coordinate system.  The consequence is that internal constraints
are built into the model when, for example, the elements are offset in the y-direction, are joined by stiffness
in the x- and z-directions, and the element has a rotation about the x or z axis.
CBUSH  elements are used to join the plates in the second subcase.  The coordinate system of the elastomer
must be defined for each element.  The option for defining the elastomer coordinate system, which is useable
for all geometry including coincident and very close grid points, is the CID option in field 9 of the CBUSH
entry.  Since the welds are regarded as isotropic, the basic coordinate system is selected by a value of 0.  No
other consideration of geometry is needed regardless of the coordinate systems used to define grid point
locations or displacement system directions.&lt;br&gt;
The input entries for a weld are shown for each modeling method in Listing 4-2.  The CBUSH element
requires one concise line of nonredundant data per weld, plus a common property entry for all elements,

while the CELAS2-based model requires six lines per weld.  It would require even more input per weld if the
geometry were modeled properly.

The use of PARAM, EST,YES outputs the length of each element, a modeling check to ensure that the wrong
grid points have not been joined or that the misalignment has not been modeled correctly because the length
between connected points is greater than the manufacturing tolerance of 0.1 units.  If wrong (nonadjacent)
points are inadvertently joined by CELASi elements, large internal constraints can be generated that can be
difficult to diagnose.
The OLOAD resultants and the SPC-force resultants for the two models ( Figure 4-7) illustrate the effects of
internal constraints caused by the misaligned CELASi elements.  The first load case is for CELASi modeling
and the second line is for CBUSH modeling.  When there are no internal constraints, the constraint
resultants are equal and opposite to the load resultants.  Any unbalance is due to internal constraints.
Figure 4-7  Output of Load and SPC-Force Resultants
The resultants in the CBUSH weld model balance to the degree of accuracy shown in the printout.  The
CELASi-based model resultants match to the degree of accuracy shown in the printout for forces, but only
to two or three digits for moments.  A review of grid point force balance output shows that the grid points
attached to CELASi elements are in balance even though they contain internal constraints.  This shows the
difficulty in diagnosing elements with internal constraints in model check-out condition activities.  Evidence
of internal constraints are apparent in static analysis when the resultants are not in balance.  The analysis does
not isolate the elements with internal constraints; instead it merely states that some internal constraints must
exist.&lt;br&gt;
The CELASi, CBUSH, CINTC and permanent glue methods could all be used for this problem, but the
CBUSH and permanent glue are the recommended methods.OUTPUT OF LOAD AND SPCFORCE RESULTANTS

One-Dimensional Elements
The one-dimensional elements are used to represent structural members that have stiffness along a line or
curve between two grid points.  Typical applications include beam type structures, stiffeners, tie-down
members, supports, mesh transitions, and many others.  The one-dimensional elements that are discussed in
this chapter include the CROD, CBAR, CBEAM, and CTUBE elements.
The CROD  Element
The CROD element is a straight prismatic element (the properties are constant along the length) that has
only axial and torsional stiffness.  The CROD element is the simplest element of all the elements that have
geometry (the scalar elements are simpler; however, they do not have geometry associated with them).  If
desired, the CBAR or CBEAM element can be used to represent a rod member; however, these elements are
somewhat more difficult to define because you need to specify an element coordinate system explicitly.  If
you need an element with only tension-compression and torsion, the CROD element is an ideal choice.
The format of the Bulk Data entry CROD  in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide is as follows:
CROD
The CROD element is defined by specifying the two grid points G1 and G2 that denote the end points of
the element.  The PID identifies the PROD  entry that defines the cross-sectional area A, and the torsional
constant J associated with the CROD element.  The format of the Bulk Data entry PROD  in the MSC Nastran
Quick Reference Guide  is as follows:

Main Index
Referring to the above PROD entry, if the cross-sectional area field (field 4) is left blank on the PROD entry,
the corresponding CROD elements lacks axial stiffness.  Likewise, if the field corresponding to the torsional
stiffness is left blank (field 5), the corresponding CROD element does not have torsional stiffness.
An example using the CROD element is given in Grid Points, Scalar Points, and Coordinate Systems  without much
description.  In that example, the truss members are connected with pin joints.  Since pin joints cannot
transmit a moment, the only force acting on the members is an axial force.  The CROD element is an ideal
choice for this type of model because the CROD element only has stiffness along the axis of the element and
in torsion about the axis of the element.
The conventions for the element coordinate system  and the internal forces of the CROD element are shown
in Figure 4-8.
Figure 4-8  CROD Element Internal Forces and Moments
To illustrate the use of the CROD element, consider a three-member truss structure attached to a rigid wall
as shown in Figure 4-9.  The input file is shown in Listing 4-2. (See MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/rod2.dat)

A selected portion of the output illustrating the displacements and the stresses is shown in Figure 4-10.
Figure 4-10  Three-Member Truss Selected Output
Several important points should be made regarding the input file.  The boundary conditions of the truss are
applied as permanent constraints using the value 123456 in field 8 of the GRID entries with IDs 1, 2, and
3.  There are no constraints applied to grid point 4, so it is free to move in any direction.  To verify that
boundary conditions are applied correctly, review the displacement vector in Figure 4-10.  As can be seen, the
displacements of grid points 1, 2, and 3 are exactly equal to zero in each direction.
You should also note that grid point 4 displacement is acting in the YZ plane.  This result makes sense because
the structure is symmetric about the YZ plane and the applied load is in the Y-direction.  Another item to
note is that the rotation of grid point 4 is equal to zero in each of the three directions.  This may be a little
disconcerting if you are a new user since you may expect the grid point to rotate about the X-axis.  However,
the CROD element cannot transmit a bending load, and as such, the rotation at the end of the CROD
element is not coupled to the translational degrees of freedom.  In fact, if the rotation degrees of freedom for
grid point 4 is constrained, the answers are the same.
The stress output shows an axial and torsional stress only.  There are no bending stresses in a CROD element.&lt;br&gt;
In this case, the torsional stress is zero because there is no torsional load on the members.  The safety of margin
is blank in our example because the stress limits fields specified in the MAT1 entry are left blank.  The MAT1
entry is discussed in Material Properties and Composites .
There are two other elements that possess axial and torsional stiffness only:  the CONROD  and the CTUBE&lt;br&gt;
element.  The CONROD element is identical to the CROD element except that the rod properties are
entered on the CONROD entry itself.  The CTUBE element is the same as the CROD element except that
its section properties are expressed as the outer diameter and the thickness of a circular tube.  The extensional
and torsional stiffness are computed from these tube dimensions.  The properties of the CTUBE element are
defined using a PTUBE entry. D I S P L A C E M E N T   V E C T O R&lt;/p&gt;

The CBAR  Element
The CBAR element is a straight one-dimensional element that connects two grid points.  The capabilities
and limitations of the CBAR element are as summarized:
Extensional stiffness along the neutral axis and torsional stiffness about the neutral axis may be
defined.
Bending and transverse shear stiffness can be defined in the two perpendicular directions to the
CBAR element’s axial direction.
The properties must be constant along the length of the CBAR element.  This limitation is not
present in the CBEAM element.
The shear center and the neutral axis must coincide.  This limitation is not present in the CBEAM
element.
The ends of the CBAR element may be offset from the grid points.
The effect of out-of-plane cross-sectional warping  is neglected.  This limitation is not present in the
CBEAM element.
The stress may be computed at up to four locations on the cross section at each end.  Additional
output may be obtained for intermediate locations along the length of the CBAR using the
CBARAO Bulk Data entry.
Transverse shear stiffness  along the length of the CBAR can be included.
The torsional mass moment of inertia is included in the BAR mass matrix by using  NASTRAN BARMASS
(398)=1. Note, by default, this term will not be included. For both values of PARAM COUPMASS, this term
is added. If desired, the BARMASS default value can be changed via the NASTRAN rc file.
The stiffness of the CBAR element is derived from classical beam theory (plane cross sections remain plane
during deformation).
The connectivity of the CBAR element is entered with the Bulk Data entry CBAR in the MSC Nastran Quick
Reference Guide , and its format is as follows:

11. Offset vectors are treated like rigid elements.
•Two methods are available for the computation of offsets: original and enhanced. The default
method is the original method. The enhanced method is requested by the Bulk Data entry
MDLPRM ,OFFDEF ,LROFF. For options of offsets, please refer to the Bulk Data entry
MDLPRM,OFFDEF,option.
•The length of offset vectors is not affected by thermal loads. But the thermal load changes due to
location changes by offsets are correctly computed if the enhanced method is used.
•BAR elements with offsets will give correct buckling results if the enhanced method is used.
•Masses are correctly transformed for offset effects if the enhanced method is used.
•In nonlinear solution sequences, such as SOL 106 or SOL 400, BAR is treated as linear element.
If geometric nonlinear effects are required, please use Bulk Data entry MDLPRM ,BRTOBM,1 to

12. OFFT is a character string code that describes how the offset and orientation vector components are
to be interpreted. By default (string input is GGG or blank), the offset vectors are measured in the
displacement coordinate systems at grid points A and B and the orientation vector is measured in the
displacement coordinate system of grid point A. At user option, the offset vectors can be measured
in an offset coordinate system relative to grid points A and B, and the orientation vector can be
measured in the basic system as indicated in the following table:
Any attempt to specify invalid combinations results in a bulk data entry input error message. For
example, a value of OOO (indicating offset and orientation vectors are specified in an offset reference
system) results in a fatal error since the orientation vector cannot be specified in an offset system. The
offset system x-axis is defined from GA to GB. The orientation vector  and the offset system x-axis
are then used to define the z and y axes of the offset system. A vector is formed from a cross product
of a vector going from Grid A to Grid B and the orientation vector to create the offset coordinate z-
direction. To obtain a nonzero cross product the orientation vector must not be parallel to both
vectors from Grid A to Grid B for the offset coordinate system and End A and End B for the element
coordinate system. (Note: The character “O” in the table replaces the obsolete character “E”.)
The properties of the CBAR elements are entered on the PBAR entry that is identified by the PID entered
in field 3.  The format of the Bulk Data entry PBAR in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide is as follows:

As in the case of the CROD element, any of the stiffnesses and flexibilities may be omitted by leaving the
appropriate fields on the PBAR entry blank.  For example, if fields 5 and 6 are blank, the element will lack
bending stiffness.
One the most difficult aspects of the CBAR (or CBEAM element) for the first-time users is understanding
the need to define an orientation vector.  The best way to see the need for the orientation vector is by an
example.  Consider the two I-beams shown in Figure 4-11.  The I-beams have the same properties because they
have the same dimensions; however, since they have different orientations in space, their stiffness
contribution to the structure is different.  Therefore, simply specifying the I-beam properties and the location
of the end points via the grid points is insufficient-you must also describe the orientation.  This is done using
the orientation vector.
Figure 4-11  Demonstration of Beam Orientation
Defining the orientation of a element in space is accomplished with the use of an orientation vector.  Another
way of looking at the orientation vector is that it is a vector that specifies the local element coordinate system.&lt;br&gt;
Since the geometric properties are entered in the element coordinate system, this orientation vector specifies
the orientation of the element.
The orientation vector   as it is related to the CBAR element coordinate system is shown in Figure 4-12.

Figure 4-12  CBAR Element Coordinate System
Referring to Figure 4-12, the element x-axis is defined as the line extending from end A (the end at grid point
GA) to end B (the end at grid point GB).  Grid points GA and GB are defined on the CBAR entry.  Also
note that the ends of the CBAR element may be offset from the grid points using WA and WB as defined
on the CBAR entry.  Therefore, the element x-axis does not necessarily extend from grid point GA to grid
point GB; it extends from end A to end B.
The element y-axis is defined to be the axis in Plane 1 extending from end A and perpendicular to the element
x-axis.  It is your responsibility to define Plane 1.  Plane 1 is the plane containing the element x-axis and the
orientation vector .  After defining the element x- and y-axes, the element z-axis is obtained using the right-
hand rule, . Finally, Plane 2 is the plane containing element x- and z-axes.  Note that once you
defined grid point GA and GB and the orientation vector , the element coordinate system is computed
automatically by MSC Nastran.
The vector  shown in Figure 4-13 may be defined by one of two methods on the CBAR entry.  The first
method is to define vector  by entering the components of the vector, (X1, X2, X3), which is defined in a
coordinate system located at the end of the CBAR.  This coordinate system is parallel to the displacement
coordinate system of the grid point GA, which is defined in field 7 of the GRID entry.  You can alternatively
define the vector  with the use of another grid point called G0, which is entered in field 6 of the CBAR
entry.
As mentioned previously, the ends of the CBAR may be offset  from the grid points using the vectors WA and
WB.  If the CBAR is offset from the grid points and the components of vector  are entered (i.e., field 6 of x

the CBAR entry is a real number), then the tail of vector  is at end A, not grid point GA.  If the vector&lt;br&gt;
is defined with the use of another grid point G0 (field 6 of the CBAR entry is an integer number), then vector
is defined as the line originating at grid point GA, not end A, and passing through G0.  Note that Plane
1 is parallel to the vector GA-G0 and passes through the location of end A.

are entered using fields 4 through 9 of the CBAR continuation entry.  When you specify an offset, you are
effectively defining a rigid connection from the grid point to the end of the element.
The element forces and stresses are computed and output in the element coordinate system . Figure 4-14 shows
the forces acting on the CBAR element.  V1 and M1 are the shear force and bending moment acting in Plane
1, and V2 and M2 are the shear force and bending moment acting in Plane 2.
Figure 4-14  CBAR Element Forces
The area moments of inertia I1 and I2 are entered in fields 5 and 6, respectively, of the PBAR entry.  I1 is
the area moment of inertia to resist a moment in Plane 1. I1 is not the moment of inertia about Plane 1 as
many new users may think at first. Consider the cross section shown in Figure 4-15; in this case, I1 is what
most textbooks call Izz, and I2 is Iyy. The area product of inertia I12, if needed, may be entered using field 4
of the second continuation entry.  For most common engineering cross sections, it is usually not necessary
to define an I12.  By aligning the element y- and the z-axes with the principal axes of the cross section, I12,
is equal to zero and is therefore not needed.
As an example, consider the three-member truss structure in the previous section.  Now suppose the joints
are rigidly connected so that the members are to carry a bending load.  Since CROD elements cannot
transmit a bending load, they cannot be used for this problem.  The CBAR element is a good choice because
it contains bending stiffness (if area moments of inertia are input within the PBAR entry).Plane 1 A Bye

In this example, the area moments of inertia for each of the members are I1 = 10.67 and I2 =2.67 for Plane
1 and Plane 2, respectively.  The Bulk Data input for this problem is shown in Listing 4-4. (See
MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/bar1.dat.) The vector  for each of the CBAR elements is defined using the
component method.  The fact that field 6 of the CBAR entries contains a real number (a decimal point is
present) tells MSC Nastran that the component method is being used.  Note that the length of  vector  is
not critical&amp;ndash;only the orientation is required to define Plane 1.

ENDDATA
You may notice that all of the orientation vectors point toward the geometric center of the bars.  It is just as
easy to define the orientation vectors for this structure to use the G0 method as shown in Listing 4-5. (See
MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/bar1a.dat.)
Although the G0 grid point may be any grid point in the model, it is good modeling practice to use a grid
point that is not attached to the structure.  If the grid point is part of the structure and the structure is
modified, the vector  orientation may be inadvertently changed, resulting in a modeling error.  A modeling
error of this nature is usually very difficult to identify.  In this example, a new grid point with ID 99 was
created and fixed at location (0,0,0).  Both methods shown in Listing 4-4 and Listing 4-5 produce the same
results.

The displacement and stress results are shown in Figure 4-16.  As expected, the displacement of grid point 4
is in the YZ plane due to symmetry (this was also case for the previous CROD example).  However, the
displacement of grid point 4 is slightly less because of the addition of the bending stiffness.  Also, the
rotations at grid point 4 are now nonzero values because they are connected to the structure and are free to
move.&lt;/p&gt;

The SAi and SBi are the bending stresses at ends A and B, respectively.  The i = 1, 2, 3, and 4  stress recovery
locations  correspond to the locations C, D, E, and F on the cross section, respectively.  The location of these
stress recovery coefficients are defined in CBAR’s element coordinate system.  Consider the cross section for
our example as shown in Figure 4-17.  By request, the stresses are computed at four locations.  As is commonly
done, the stress locations represent the farthest points from the neutral axis of the cross section.  These points
are the locations of the maximum bending stress.
Figure 4-17  Stress Recovery Locations
In addition to the normal stress included in the stress output, there is axial stress in the CBAR elements,
which is constant along the length of the bar.  The SA-MAX, SB-MAX, SA-MIN, and SB-MIN stresses are
the maximum and minimum combined bending and axial stresses for each end.  There is no torsional stress
recovery for the CBAR element.  The last column of the stress output is the margin-of-safety calculation based
on the tension and compression stress limits entered on the material entry.  Since the stress limit fields are left
blank, margin-of-safeties are not computed for this example. D I S P L A C E M E N T   V E C T O R&lt;/p&gt;

It is important to remember that the margin-of-safety computation does not include the torsional stress.  If
the torsional stress is important in your stress analysis, use the torsional force output to compute the stress
outside of MSC Nastran.  Although this may seem like an unnecessary burden, it is very logical.  The
torsional stress is highly dependent on the geometry of the CBAR’s cross section, which MSC Nastran does
not know.  For this example, the cross-sectional properties  (A, I1, I2, J) of each member are input, but the
fact that that the cross-section is rectangular is unknown to MSC Nastran.  T o compute the torsional stress,
a formula for a rectangular cross section should be used.
PBARL  &amp;ndash; An Alternate and Convenient Method for Defining Bar Cross Sections
The PBAR input that has been discussed so far requires you to calculate the cross-sectional properties of the
beam (such as area, moments of inertia, shear center, etc.).  Although this is not a particularly difficult task
for standard cross sections, it is tedious and and prone to unnecessary input errors.&lt;br&gt;
The beam cross-section library  provides an interface to input common beam cross sections into
MSC Nastran.  A number of common cross-section types such as bar, box, I-beam, channel, angle, etc. are
described within the Bulk Data Section by the cross section’s dimensions instead of the section properties.&lt;br&gt;
For example, a rectangle cross section may be defined by its height and depth rather than the area, moments
of inertia, etc.  The section properties are calculated based on thin wall assumptions.
The Bulk Data entry PBARL  in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide  allows you to input cross section types
along with their characteristic dimensions.  You can choose from 21 different cross section shapes.  These
shapes are as follows:  ROD, TUBE, TUBE2, I, CHAN (channel), T, BOX, BAR (rectangle), CROSS, H,
T1, I1, CHAN1, Z, CHAN2, T2, BOX1, HEXA (hexagon), HAT (hat section), HAT1 and DBOX.
For some of these shapes (I, CHAN, T, and BOX), you can also select different orientations.  All the 21
different shapes and orientations are shown in Figure 4-18.
To define section attributes such as height and width on the DIMi fields, use the PBARL entry.  T o define
section properties such as area and moment of inertia, use the PBAR Bulk Data entry.  The PBARL entries
are easier to use and still retain most of the capabilities of the existing PBAR method, including non-
structural mass.
An additional difference between the PBARL and the PBAR entries is that stress recovery points are not
specified by the user to obtain stress output for the PBARL entry.  The stress recovery points are automatically
calculated at the locations shown in Figure 4-18 to give the maximum stress for the cross section.
In addition to the standard sections provided by MSC, you can add your own library of cross sections to suit
your needs.  To add your own library, write a few simple subroutines in FORTRAN to interface with MSC
Nastran through Inter-Process Communications.  See Remarks 6, 7, and 8 of the PBARL  in the MSC Nastran
Quick Reference Guide for further details regarding the creation of your own library of cross sections.
This automatic cross section computation greatly simplifies the formulation of design variables for design
optimization applications.&lt;/p&gt;

The example shown in Listing 4-5 is the same one used in Listing 4-3, except the PBAR entry is replaced by the
PBARL entry.  A condensed version of the corresponding output is shown in Figure 4-19.  A slight difference
in the output can be attributed to the fact that only four significant digits are provided in the PBAR example
shown in Listing 4-3.  Note also that the order of the stress data recovery points is different in the two
examples.

Figure 4-19  Displacement and Stress Results for Bar Structure Using PBARL
The CBAR element assumes that the neutral axis and shear center coincide.  For an unsymmetric section, the
actual shear center does not coincide with the neutral axis.  If this difference is significant, you should use the
CBEAM element instead (see the discussion of the CBEAM element later in this section); otherwise, the
results may be incorrect.
An additional feature of the CBAR element is the ability to remove some of the connections of individual
degrees of freedom from the grid points.  This operation is accomplished using the pin flags feature located
in the CBAR entry (fields 2 and 3 of the continuation entry).  For example, suppose you want to connect
two bar elements together with a hinge (or pin joint) as shown in Figure 4-20.  This connection can be made
by placing an integer 456 in the PB field of CBAR 1 or a 456 in the PA field of CBAR 2.

Figure 4-20  A Hinge Connection
The sample bridge model shown in Figure 4-21 is used to illustrate the application of pin flags.  In this case,
the rotational degree of freedom, z at end B of the braces (grid points 7 and 16) connected to the horizontal
span, is released.  Note that these degrees of freedoms are referenced in terms of the element coordinate
systems. The deflected shapes for the cases with and without releases  are shown in Figure 4-22, and Figure 4-23,
respectively. The corresponding abridged stress outputs for the cases with and without releases are shown in
Figure 4-24 and Figure 4-25, respectively.  Elements 30 and 40 are the two brace elements that are connected
to the horizontal span.  Note that in the case with releases at ends B, there is no moment transfer to the brace
(grid points 7 and 16) at these locations. The moments, however, are transferred across the horizontal span
(elements 6, 7, 14, and 15). For clarity, only the pertinent element and grid numbers are shown in Figure 4-21.

The CBEAM  Element
The CBEAM element provides all of the capabilities of the CBAR element discussed in the previous section,
plus the following additional capabilities:
Different cross-sectional properties may be defined at both ends and at as many as nine intermediate
locations along the length of the beam.
he neutral axis  and shear center  do not need to coincide.  The feature is important for
unsymmetric sections.
The effect of cross-sectional warping on torsional stiffness is included. ELEMENT        SA1            SA2            SA3            SA4           AXIAL          SA-MAX         SA-MIN     M.S.-T

11. Offset vectors are treated like rigid elements. Two methods are available for the computation of
offsets: original and enhanced. The default method is the original method. The enhanced method is
requested by the Bulk Data entry MDLPRM ,OFFDEF,LROFF. For options of offsets, please refer to
the Bulk Data entry MDLPRM,OFFDEF,option.
12. OFFT in field 9 is a character string code that describes how the offset and orientation vector
components are to be interpreted. By default (string input is GGG or blank), the offset vectors are
measured in the displacement coordinate systems at grid points A and B and the orientation vector
is measured in the displacement coordinate system of grid point A. At user option, the offset vectors
can be measured in an offset system relative to grid points A and B, and the orientation vector can be
measured in the basic system as indicated in the following table:
Any attempt to specify invalid combinations results in a bulk data entry input error message. For
example, a value of OOO (indicating offset and orientation vectors are specified in an offset reference
system) results in a fatal error since the orientation vector cannot be specified in an offset system. The
offset system x-axis is defined from GA to GB. The orientation vector  and the offset system x-axis
are then used to define the z and y axes of the offset system. A vector is formed from a cross product
of a vector going from Grid A to Grid B and the orientation vector to create the offset coordinate z-
direction. To obtain a nonzero cross product the orientation vector must not be parallel to both
vectors from Grid A to Grid B for the offset coordinate system and End A and End B for the element
coordinate system. (Note: The character “O” in the table replaces the obsolete character “E”.)Components of offset vectors from the grid points to the end points of the axis of

The coordinate system for the CBEAM element, shown in Figure 4-26, is similar to that of the CBAR element.&lt;br&gt;
The only difference is that the element x-axis for the CBEAM element is along the shear center of the
CBEAM.  The neutral axis and the nonstructural mass axis may be offset from the elemental x-axis.  (For the
CBAR element, all three are coincident with the x-axis.)  The vector  is defined in the the same manner as
it is for the CBAR element.

The CBEAM element presents you with more options than any other element in the MSC Nastran element
library.  It is not expected that you will employ all of the features of the CBEAM element at the same time.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore, you may omit most of the data fields corresponding to the features that are not being used.  For
those data fields that are left blank, a default value is used, as described in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide .
An exception to this rule is the data fields for A, I1, and I2. If any of these fields is left blank, a fatal message
occurs. While this is acceptable for the CBAR element, it is not acceptable for the CBEAM element. The
difference is due to the way that the element stiffness matrix is generated. For the CBAR element, the element
stiffness matrix is generated directly from the input data. For instance, if I1 for a CBAR element is zero, then
the corresponding element stiffness matrix term is null, which is not necessarily a problem. On the other
hand, the CBEAM element uses the input data to generate an element flexibility matrix, which must be
inverted to produce the element stiffness matrix. Therefore, positive values for A, I1, and I2 must be entered.
As an example, consider the truss model shown earlier in Figure 4-9. T o convert a CBAR model to a CBEAM
model, only three changes are needed. Change the CBAR name to CBEAM, change the PBAR name to a
PBEAM, and change the location of J from field 7 of the PBAR entry to field 8 of the PBEAM entry. (See
MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/beam1.dat)
One difference between the CBAR element and the CBEAM element, that is not obvious, is the default
values used for the transverse shear flexibility.  For the CBAR element, the default values for K1 and K2 are
infinite, which is equivalent to zero transverse shear flexibility.  For the CBEAM element, the default values
for K1 and K2 are both 1.0, which includes the effect of transverse shear in the elements.  If you want to set
the transverse shear flexibility to zero, which is the same as the CBAR element, use a value of 0.0 for K1 and
K2.
The resulting stress output is shown in Figure 4-27.
Figure 4-27  CBEAM Stress Output
As shown in Figure 4-27, the stress output for the CBEAM element is not the same as that for the CBAR
element.  For CBAR elements, the SAi and SBi columns are the stresses due to bending only, and the axial
stresses is given in a separate column.  For the CBEAM element, however, the values at SXC, SXD, SXE, and
SXF are the stresses due to the bending and axial forces on the CBEAM at stress locations C, D, E, and F on
the cross section.  Stress recovery is performed at the end points and any intermediate location is defined on
the PBEAM entry.
As another example for the beam element that uses more of the CBEAM features, consider the tapered beam
shown in Figure 4-28. S T R E S S E S   I N   B E A M   E L E M E N T S        ( C B E A M )

Figure 4-28  Tapered Beam Example
Because the cross section is an open channel section, the shear center of the beam does not coincide with the
neutral axis.  In general, you must decide in your model planning whether having noncoincident shear and
neutral axes is significant for your application.  Since for this example the entire structure is a single tapered
beam, modeling the offset is important.  There are two methods that can be used to model the offset.  The
first method is to place the shear axis on the line between the end grid points 1 and 2.  In this case the neutral SEnd B (Free)192 lb (Acting at the neutral axis)

axis is offset from the shear axis using the yna, zna, ynb, and znb offsets (see Figure 4-26) entered on the PBEAM
entry.
The second method to model the noncoincidental axes in this example is to place the neutral axis on the line
extending from grid point 1 to grid point 2.  In this case, the offsets WA and WB, entered on the CBEAM
entry, are used to position the shear axis at the appropriate location.  The yna, zna, ynb, and znb offsets entered
on the PBEAM entry are then used to position the neutral axis to the appropriate position.
Both methods represent the same CBEAM element but are positioned differently with respect to the grid
points.  The first method requires one set of offset values to be entered, and the second method requires two
sets of offset values.  The forces are applied to the grid points.  By using the second method for this problem,
the loads are then applied at the neutral axis instead of the shear center axis.  By doing so, you can observe
the twisting of the beam due to a pure vertical load.
The input file is shown in Listing 4-7. (See sample problem MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/beam2.dat.) The
offsets WA = (2.367,0.0,0.0) and WB =(1.184,0.0,0.0) are entered on the CBEAM entry to define the
locations of the shear axis.  The neutral axis is offset from the shear axis using the offsets yna = 0.0, zna = 2.367,
ynb=0.0, and znb = 1.184 entered on the PBEAM entry.  It may appear that the offsets do not accomplish
the desired goal of placing the neutral axis in the right location because all of the offset are positive.  However,
keep in mind that the shear center offsets (WA and WB) are in the displacements coordinate system,
measured from GA and GB, respectively.  The neutral axis offsets are in the CBEAM’s element coordinate
system.
Nine intermediate stations are used to model the taper.  Since the properties are not a linear function of the
distance along the beam (A is, but I1 and I2 are not), it is necessary to compute the cross-sectional properties
for each of the stations.  The properties for the nine stations are entered on the PBEAM entry.
To demonstrate all of the capabilities of the CBEAM element, beam warping is included; however, beam
warping is not significant for this problem.
You should note the locations of the stress recovery locations on the PBEAM entry.  The stress recovery
locations are entered with respect to the shear axis, not the neutral axis (i.e., they are input with respect to the
element coordinate system).  MSC Nastran computes the distance from the neutral axis internally for the
stress recovery.

ENDDATA
The displacement results, as shown in Figure 4-29, include the displacements of the grid points at the end of
the CBEAM and scalar points 101 and 102.  As mentioned previously, the force is applied directly to the grid
point; therefore, the force acts at the neutral axis of the beam.  Since the shear center is offset from the neutral
axis, a loading of this type should cause the element to twist.  This result can be observed in the R3
displacement, which represents the twist of the beam.  If the shear center is not offset from the neutral axis,
R3 will be zero.  The displacements of scalar points 101 and 102 represent the twist due to the warping at
ends A and B, respectively.
The forces in the beam are shown in Figure 4-30.  The total torque and the warping torque acting along the
beam is printed.  As can be seen, the warping for this case is negligible.  Note that the inclusion of warping
does not affect any of the other forces in the CBEAM element.  The stress recovery output is shown in
Figure 4-31.  The stress output shows only the longitudinal stress; hence, any stress due to torsional or warping
is not included.&lt;/p&gt;

PBEAML &amp;ndash; An Alternate and Convenient Method for Defining CBEAM Cross Sections
Similar to the CBAR element, you can define the property for the CBEAM element by specifying the cross-
sectional dimensions (DIM1, DIM2, etc.) instead of the cross-sectional properties (A, I, etc.) for the cross
sections shown in Figure 4-32.  The PBEAML  entry is used for this purpose and the format for the Bulk Data
entry PBEAML  in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide is as follows:

5.If any of the fields NSM(B), DIMi(B) are blank on the continuation entry for End B, the values are
set to the values given for end A. For the continuation entries that have values of X(j)/XB between
0.0 and 1.0 and use the default option (blank field), a linear interpolation between the values at ends
A and B is performed to obtain the missing field.
6.The GROUP is associated with a FMS CONNECT statement, which specifies the evaluator. A
reserved GROUP name is “MSCBML0”. Users may create their own cross-section types. Each of the
types will require a one or more subroutines to convert DIMi information to geometric property
information contained on a PBEAM entry. See Building and Using the Sample Programs  in the MSC
Nastran Utilities Guide  for a discussion of how to include a user-defined beam library.
7.For GROUP =“MSCBML0”, the cross-sectional properties, shear flexibility factors and stress
recovery points are computed using the TYPE and DIMi as shown in Figure 4-32. The element
coordinate system is located at the shear center.
8.A function of this entry is to derive an equivalent PBEAM entry. Any sorted echo request will also
cause printout and/or punch of the derived PBEAM.
9.Beams can have no more than 14 dimensions per station. The total number of dimensions at all
stations must be less than 200. The transfer of data with the beam server is limited to 4000 words.
None of these limits are exceeded with the MSC beam library, but a user defined beam library could.&lt;/p&gt;

(continued)
The problem shown in Figure 4-28 is rerun using the PBEAML entry.  (See
MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/beam2n.dat) Since the cross section geometry is a channel section, the TYPE
field (field five) on the PBEAML entry is assigned the value “CHAN”.  Four dimensional values are required
at each station that output is desired. Cross sectional properties cannot be output is desired, or cross sectional
properties that cannot be interpolated linearly between the values at the two ends of the CBEAM element.&lt;br&gt;
For this example, since only the dimensional values for the two end points and at the middle of the CBEAM
element are provided, only output at these locations are available.  The complete input and partial output
files are shown in Listing 4-8 and Figure 4-33, respectively.
In this case, the values 4.0, 6.0, 1.0, and 1.0 on the first continuation entry represent DIM1, DIM2, DIM3,
and DIM4, respectively at end A.  The values YES, 0.5, 3.0, 4.5, 0.75, and 0.75 on the first and second
continuation entries represent stress output request, value of X(1)/XB, DIM1 at X(1)/XB, DIM2 at
X(1)/X(B), DIM3 at X(1)/XB, and DIM4 at X(1)/X(B), respectively at X(1)/X(B) = 0.5.  The values YES,
1.0, 2.0, 3.0 0.5, and 0.5 on the second and third continuation entries represent stress output request, end
B, DIM1 at end B, DIM2 at end B, DIM3 at end B, and DIM4 at end B, respectively.

Figure 4-33  Stress Output for the Tapered Beam using Cross-Sectional Dimension
As a side topic to help understand the implementation of warping , it is useful to see the actual equations
being used.  The basic equation for twist about the shear center of a beam is given by
(4-2)
where Cw is the warping coefficient.
The twist of the beam is defined as
(4-3)
Substituting Equation (4-2) into Equation (4-3) and transferring the applied internal torsional moments to the
end of the beam, the equation for the warping stiffness is reduced to Equation (4-4).
(4-4)
The scalar points defined on the CBEAM entry are used to represent the . Tx is the warping torque.
Returning to our taper beam model, it is interesting to see how the single beam element compares to the same
member modeled as plate elements and solid elements. Table 4-1 shows the results of modeling the tapered
member using a single CBEAM element, plate elements (CQUAD4), and solid elements (CHEXA).  The
CQUAD4 and CHEXA elements are described in Two-Dimensional Elements  and Three-Dimensional Elements ,
respectively.0&lt;/p&gt;

The single beam element model with only 14 degrees-of-freedom compares well with the 15,435-degree-of-
freedom solid model.  The CQUAD4 plate model is included for completeness.  T ypically, you do not use
plate elements for this type of structure.  The flanges and web are very thick and do not behave like plates.&lt;br&gt;
The stress results shown in Table 4-1 reflect this situation.
The solid model, on the other hand, represents a good use of the CHEXA element.  This is discussed later in
the solid element section.  All of the input file for this example can be located on the delivery media for your
review.
Arbitrary Beam Cross-Section  (ABCS)
Beam elements have long been a staple in MSC Nastran.  Over the years, the capability of beam element has
grown steadily from constant cross section of PBAR to variable cross section of PBEAM.  However, users are
required to compute the sectional properties in order to utilize BAR and/or BEAM elements in the analysis.&lt;br&gt;
To alleviate the amount of effort from engineers, PBARL and PBEAML were added for popular cross
sectional profiles.  But modeling alternatives for 1-D structural components with arbitrary cross sectional
shapes was needed particularly by the automotive industry. The Arbitrary Beam Cross-Section (ABCS)
capability uses the PBRSECT and PBMSECT Bulk Data entries along with the POINT , SET1 and SET3
Bulk Data entries.
The shape of the beam cross section  is defined using sets of POINTs as defined on the SET1or SET3 Bulk
Data entry. These sets are referenced by Bulk Data entries - PBRSECT  for the BAR, and PBMSECT  in the MSC
Nastran Quick Reference Guide for the BEAM; which also defines the cross section form parameters, and
reference material properties.  The types of section that can be defined include a General Section, Open
Profile, and Closed Profile, with various parameters required on the PBRSECT or PBMSECT entries to
define outer perimeter, inner perimeter, and branch segments where applicable.
1.BRP for CP and OP must start or end branching from OUTP. BRP must not start or end from
another BRP.
2.BRP must not branch out from the end of OUTP. This rule covers both CP and OP.
3.For CP and OP, a T = rs , where rs denotes a positive real single precision number, must be present
even if the thickness for every segment is separately defined. This thickness will be used for all
segments which do not have specific thickness defined for them.
4.When PT=(id1,id2) is utilized to define the thickness of a segment, the id1 and id2 must be next to
each other on the SET1 or SET3. A warning message will be issued if this guideline is not observed.Table 4-1  Comparison of the Beam, Plate, and Solid Element Model

Equivalent BAR and BEAM elements are created from the data supplied by the PBRSECT and PBMSECT
entries.  These equivalent element definitions are printed on the output file. Currently for the BEAM
element, only a constant cross section beam is supported.
Parts of two example problems will be shown. One for the General Section (see
MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/zbeamgs.dat)and one for the Open Profile (see
MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/zbeamop.dat). Figure 4-34 shows the Z-Section being defined.

For output, ABCS provides complete stress recovery for the whole cross-section with torsion and shear effect
included.  The stresses recovered can be post-processed using GPSTRESS via SURFACE for each distinct
cross-section. The ABCS algorithm is the default formulation for pre-defined shapes of PBARL/PBEAML.
The ABCS algorithm call finite element formulation (FEF) is supported only on short-word machines.
Previously, the equations used for PBARL/PBEAML were constructed under the as sumption that the cross-
sections are thin-walled. Now the properties, especially J, K1, K2, Cwa and Cwb, are computed correctly
regardless if the section is thin-walled or not.  T o return to the previous formulation (Beam Library) set
MDLPRM ,TWBRBML,1. Selection is noted in the output file.
ABCS output includes a number of features , such as the Output of a PostScript, ‘.ps’, file for displaying the
outline of cross-section.  Also included in the ‘.ps’ file is the markers of center of gravity and shear center and
sectional properties. The generation of the .ps file is controlled by PARAM, ARBMPS ,YES  (default). The ‘ps’
file has the name of ‘zbeamgs.ps’ for an input file of ‘zbeamgs.dat’.  The PS file includes following important
information.
Outline of the cross-section
Marker for the location of center of gravity.  For ABCS via PBMSECT, marker for the location of
shear center is also shown.
Properties of the cross-section
As separate .ps is created for each PBRSECT or PBMSECT
‘PARAM,ARBMPS,NO’ turns off the generation of PS file.  Figure 4-35 shows the PBMSECT 100 from
zbeamgs.dat.&lt;/p&gt;

Another output is the generation of the Finite Element Model (FEM), for each cross-section. This is
controlled by PARAM, ARBMFEM ,YES (default). PARAM,ARBMFEM,NO switches off the generation of
‘.bdf’ file for FEM of cross-section.

There should be as many files holding FEM of cross-sections as PBRSECT/PBMSECT Bulk Data entries.&lt;br&gt;
Note that PBMSECT supports constant section beam only. Figure 4-36 shows part of a sample .bdf file. The
GRID and CTRIA6 numbering are based on the processing sequence of the arbitrary beam cross-section.&lt;br&gt;
The first GRID (or CTRIA6) of the first cross-section processed will have ID of 10001.  The first GRID of
2nd cross-section processed has ID of 20001.

Output stress data recovery for whole cross-section with included contribution from torsion and shear is
available.  In addition, ‘screened’ version of full stress recovery, which has the maximum/minimum direct
stresses and max von Mises stress is also available.
Force (or ELFORCE) Case Control output request is necessary to perform stress recovery for whole cross-
section. In addition, PARAM, ARBMSS ,YES (Default=NO)  is needed.
As a data reduction process, max/min of  xy, zx and max von Mises stress of each station of every selected
element are collected from stress recovery for the whole cross-section and printed as ‘screened’ stresses. These
can be utilized as design response for SOL 200.
The file containing stresses for whole cross-section is in OP2 format and has same naming convention as the
FEM for cross-section, but with the “.op2” extension.
For ‘screened’ stresses, an output example is shown in Figure 4-37.$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

Composite Beam - Variational Asymptotic Method (VAM )
The variational asymptotic method (VAM) is used to compute the beam properties of an arbitrary cross
section. VAM is available for both isotropic and composite materials and is very useful for composite
materials.
Beam-like structures made of composite materials, such as rotor blades, can be modeled with 3-D elements
such as CHEXA, CPENTA, and CTETRA, which can account for interaction among plies, but 3-D elements
increase the model size. Using VAM and the CBEAM3 three-noded beam element, you can model composite
beams. The layup of composite beam plies is described on the PCOMP/PCOMPG Bulk Data entries.   In
addition, the cross section of the composite beam can be expressed conveniently with the CP/OP options of
the PBMSECT Bulk Data entry.
The following keywords are for composite beams on the Bulk Data entry PBMSECT in the MSC Nastran Quick
Reference Guide :
Core(id)=[PCID,PT=(pid1,pid2)]
Specifies the composite layup for the core part of the composite. PCID is the ID of a PCOMPi/PCOMPG
Bulk Data entry. PT=(pid1,pid2) defines the start and end points of line segment(s) which utilize PCID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;141 CHAPTER 4
MSC Nastran Elements
Main Index
Layer(id)=[PCID,SETID]
Specifies the composite layup for additional layer(s) placed on the top or bottom of core. PCID is the ID of
a PCOMP/PCOMPG Bulk Data entry. SETID selects a SET1/SET3 with POINT IDs.
OUTM=value(Integer &amp;gt; 0)
Points to the ID of BEGIN BULK (Case)  ARBMODEL. OUTM is designed specifically for ABCS with finite
element discretization already available. Note that OUTM must not appear together with other keywords,
such as OUTP or INP , on a PBMSECT entry.
It should be noted that:
1.If Core and/or Layer appears in PBMSECT, the PID of PBMSECT can not be referenced on a
CBEAM entry. Instead, it should be referenced on a CBEAM3 entry.
2.Keywords T (for thickness of isotropic beam) and Core (and Layer, for composite beam) cannot
coexist on a PBMSECT entry.
3.If OUTM=arbid is used on PBMSECT, element connection, grid location, PSHELL, and material
bulk data entries must be provided after the entry “BEGIN ARBMODEL=arbid”.
4.The “arbid” that is specified on “BEGIN ARBMODEL” is considered global, and can be referenced
by PBMSECT with OUTM=arbid in a different “BEGIN SUPER” Bulk Data Section for part
superelements.&lt;br&gt;
5.PBMSECT with Core or Layer must be used along with “PARAM,ARBMSTYP,TIMOSHEN” in
the Bulk Data Section.
Selection of VAM for Properties of the Arbitrary Beam
PARAM, ARBMSTYP,TIMOSHEN
The default value for parameter ARBMSTYP is “VKI” which does not support the composite beam.
PARAM, ARBMASP,2
The default value for parameter ARBMASP is “2” (integer). Since the thickness of a ply is usually the smaller
dimension, ARBMASP affects the size of a CQUAD4 lengthwise along a segment. PARAM,ARBMASP is
functional only when PARAM,ARBMSTYP=TIMOSHEN.
Similar to ABCS with isotropic material, full stress recovery must be requested. The required input for ABCS
logic to perform stress recovery for the entire cross section is the element force. Hence, to activate stress
recovery for the entire cross section, the following must be present in the input file:
1.ELFORCE (or simply FORCE) command in the Case Control Section; and
2.PARAM, ARBMSS ,YES as a Bulk Data entry (Default = NO).
Due to the potential for a large amount of output, these stresses are only available in OUTPUT2 format. In
addition, the direct stresses corresponding to the maximum failure index computed during full ABCS stress
recovery are collected for each grid point of a CBEAM3 element and printed.
Generation of finite element model for cross sections is similar to ABCS with isotropic material. The
composite beam model is requested with the parameter PARAM, ARBMFEM ,YES. The file generated has
following naming convention:
AAA_xxyyy_zz.bdf&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Linear Statics Analysis User’s Guide
One-Dimensional Elements142
Main Index
where AAA, by default, assumes the input file name. T o alter AAA to a name a file other than the input file
name, use
ASSIGN opcase=’any character string’
As the naming implies, there should be a cross sectional FEM referenced by a PBRSECT/PBMSECT Bulk
Data entry. Note that PBMSECT supports constant section beam only. For a composite beam, a PSHELL
entry for each ply of PCOMP/PCOMPG is also part of the FEM. However, the material entries, such as
MAT1, MAT2, and/or MAT8, are not available in the FEM Bulk Data Sections.
The model can be modified (with material entries inserted) and used via ARBMODEL=arbid under the
OUTM option of PBMSECT. A word of caution on modification: CQUAD4 elements are ordered in such
a way that a line from GID1 to GID2 defines the x-axis of the element coordinate system. Current
implementation does not support reordering of element connections based on the user-provided coordinate
system.
The stresses for the entire cross section are written to a file in .op2 format and has the same naming
convention as the FEM for the cross section. For stresses, the file has the extension of .op2.
For “screened” stresses, an output example is shown as follows :
Guidelines
1.CORE (or C) should point to a PCOMP/PCOMPG entry that has the common plies for most, if
not all, segments. For example,
2.PBMSECT,32 is a box beam made of composite material. All segments have a common CORE=204
with four plies. Segments from POINTs 2 through 5 have one ply on top, layer=(210,101) ,
and one ply at the bottom, L(2)=(210,103) .xx =Character string of “BR” for PBRSECT and “BM” for PBMSECT .
yyy =ID of PBRSECT or PBMSECT.
zz =Station ID. “01” for end A of PBMSECT . No zz section for PBRSECT.

3.The negative numbers in SET1,103 indicate that the top segment traverses in opposite sequence to
the bottom segment.
4.The centerline of a profile defined by OUTP and BRP must fall in between plies.
5.Plies of a PCOMP/PCOMPG are always placed from bottom to top.
6.During transition from OUTP to BRP (or vice versa), all plies above or below the centerline, defined
via OUTP/BRP/SET1 entries, must be carried over.
7.Interior ply insertion or deletion between neighboring segments is not supported. A ply or plies added
on top of the outermost ply can be made via the Layer keyword of PBMSECT.
8.A PCOMP/PCOMPG entry referenced on a PBMSECT entry via Core/Layer is converted to
multiple PSHELL entries. The value in the THETA field on the PCOMP/PCOMPG entry is placed
in the T (thickness) field of the PSHELL entry. Due to the nonnegative requirement of the T field
of a PSHELL entry, a negative value of THETA is converted to a supplementary positive value. An
example of this conversion is shown as follows:
9.Use only matching .bdf and .op2 files from the same job to visualize the stress pattern.
Limitations
1.Although CBEAM3 has curved beam capability, CBEAM3 must be straight when used as a
composite beam.
2.TEMPRB is not supported with VAM.
Example
Part of a sample file, (see MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/vabcore1), with two PBMSECT entries is used here
to demonstrate the features implemented. A bracket is modeled with PBMSECT ,31 with isotropic material,

The CBEND  Element
The CBEND element forms a circular arc that connects two grid points.  This element has extensional and
torsional stiffness, bending stiffness, and transverse shear flexibility in two perpendicular directions.  Typical
applications of the CBEND include modeling of pressurized pipe systems and curved components that
behave as one-dimensional members.
Specific features of the CBEND element are as follows:
Principal bending axes must be parallel and perpendicular to the plane of the element (see
Figure 4-40).
The geometric center of the element may be offset in two directions (see Figure 4-40).
The offset of the neutral axis from the centroidal center due to curvature is calculated automatically
with a user-override (DN) available for the curved beam form of the element.
Four methods are available to define the plane of the element and its curvature.
Three methods are available in the curved pipe form to account for the effect of curvature on
bending stiffness and stress.
The effect of internal pressure on stiffness and stress can be accounted for using two of the three
methods mentioned in the previous item.
Axial stresses can be output at four cross-sectional points at each end of the element. Forces and
moments are output at both ends.
Distributed loads may be placed along the length of the element by means of the PLOAD1  entry.
The geometry and properties are entered on the CBEND and PBEND entries, respectively.  The transverse
shear flexibility can be omitted by leaving the appropriate fields blank on the PBEND entry.

CBEAM3 Three-Node Beam Element
A general three-node beam element has been implemented as a curved one-dimensional Timoshenko beam
element so that both the initial curvatures of beam reference axis and the cross-section shears are included in
the formulation of linear strain-displacement relations. The geometry of beam axis is specified by the offset
vectors from the grid points to the shear centers of the beam cross-sections. The quadratic interpolation is
used for both beam axis and the shape functions. When a three-node beam element degenerates to a two-
node straight beam element, the linear interpolation is adopted. Variable cross-sectional properties are
interpolated quadratically for a three-node and linearly for a degenerate two-node beam element.
Unlike CBEAM, the three-node beam element is developed based on the displacement method, in which the
displacements at nodal points are taken as primary variables and the variational principle is applied to
minimize the total element energy in formulating element stiffness, consistent mass and differential stiffness
matrices.
At each beam element nodal point, there are three translative and three rotational degrees of freedom,
respectively. When the beam cross-section torsional warping effect is considered, another degree of freedom,
which represents the warping variable, is added to the six nodal degrees of freedom at each grid point. The
warping degrees of freedom are represented by either scalar or grid points.
The three-node beam elements can be used in conjunction with higher-order shell elements, such as TRIA6
and QUAD8 that are used to model stiffeners. It can also be applied as an alternative to the existing straight
two-node beam element in modeling favorably a structural geometry with initial curvatures.
In addition to normal stresses and strains at beam cross-sections, both shear stresses and strains are also
recovered at cross-sectional stress output points. When warping effect is considered, normal stresses caused
by cross-sectional bi-moments are computed and output accordingly.
The format of a three-node beam element is specified by the Bulk Data entry CBEAM3  in the MSC Nastran
Quick Reference Guide .

simply, beam axis. Taking the locus of shear center as the beam primary reference axis is consistent with the
CBEAM element. Theoretically, the beam reference axis can be chosen arbitrarily. We also assume that the
beam reference axis is a smooth spatial curve. The beam cross-section is perpendicular to the beam axis.
Figure 4-41  Locus of Shear Center of Three-node Beam Element
The element coordinate system ( , , ) is established by the orientation vector  in the
same way as what is defined for CBEAM element, as shown in Figure 4-41.
For a spatial curve, such as the beam reference axis, the natural coordinate system is its Frenet-Serret frame
, as shown in Figure 4-41. Here ,  and  are the unit tangential, normal and bi-normal
vectors, respectively.  Tangent vector  points to the direction from A to B along the beam axis. Vector&lt;br&gt;

bending of beam axis. Bi-normal vector is perpendicular to both  and  by following the right-hand rule
of . When the beam axis is a straight line, i.e., three sectional shear centers are collinear, the
Frenet-Serret frame is undefined. Then it will be replaced by the element coordinate system.
To formulate finite element equations and define the beam element properties, a local convected coordinate
system  is created. The x-axis is always along the beam axis and its convected x coordinate is
measured by the arc-length, s. Its base vector, , is taken as same as vector . The base vectors of the local
coordinate system,  and , are defined in such a way that they rotate an angle  (pre-twist angle), from

curvilinear coordinate system  is introduced here as the local convected coordinate system,
instead of the Frenet-Serret frame, to model the pre-twist of the beam cross-section. When  = 0, the Frenet-

Element Properties, Materials and Loads
There are some similarities between PBEAM and PBEAM3 entries in terms of both format and content.
Attention, however, should be paid to their differences. The local coordinate system is primarily referred in
defining cross-sectional properties, such as area moments and product of inertia, and locations of neutral axis
and nonstructural mass center of gravity. Four stress output points on a beam cross-section are also specified
in the local coordinate system. Unlike PBEAM, in which you can specify the properties at as many as nine
intermediate stations, PBEAM3 requires their definitions at only three grid locations. For a degenerate two-
node beam element, those fields related to the mid-grid are ignored. Values of warping function and its
gradients at stress output points are required if torsional warping stresses are to be recovered.
Shear effectiveness factors may not be zero. Since the element is formulated on the Timoshenko beam theory
and quadratic shape functions are used for interpolation, zero shear effectiveness factors will not automatically
lead to a three-node Euler-Bernoulli beam element.
Limitations
There are some limitations in the current implementation with the three-node beam element. The following
is not supported:
Heat Transfer
X-Y PLOT output
Random analysis
PBEAML and PBCOMP related features
CBEAM related features, such as pin-flags and shear relief
Element forces, moments, stresses and strains, are computed at three beam cross-sections, in the local
coordinate system. These three cross-section locations are related to either three grid points or two Gauss
integration points and the parametrized origin.  Both normal and shear stresses and strains are output at four
cross-sectional stress recovery points in the local coordinate system.
Sample output of element forces, stresses and strains are shown in Examples List  (App. A).

MSC Nastran Elements
Main Index
The CQUAD4 , CTRIA3 , CQUAD8 , CTRIA6 , CQUADR , and CTRIAR  elements are commonly referred
to as the plate and shell elements within MSC Nastran.  These elements differ principally in their shape,
number of connected grid points, and number of internal stress recovery points.  Each element type can be
used to model membranes, plates, and thick or thin shells.  Their properties, which are defined using the
PSHELL entry, are identical.  The important distinction among the elements is the accuracy that is achieved
in different applications.
The CQUAD8 and CTRIA6 elements have the same features as the CQUAD4 and CTRIA3 elements, but
are not used as frequently.  The CQUAD8 and CTRIA6 are higher-order elements that allow for the use of
midside nodes in addition to corner nodes.  These midside nodes increase the accuracy of the element but
are more difficult to mesh.  Therefore, most users prefer using the CQUAD4 and CTRIA3 family of
elements.
Before discussing the elements in detail, note that for accuracy reasons the quadrilateral elements (CQUAD4
and CQUAD8) are preferred over the triangular elements (CTRIA3 and CTRIA6).  The latter are mainly
used for mesh transitions or for modeling portions of a structure when quadrilateral elements are impractical.
The CQUAD4  and CTRIA3  Elements
The connectivity of the CQUAD4 and the CTRIA3 elements are entered on the CQUAD4 and CTRIA3
entries, respectively.  The format of the Bulk Data entry CQUAD4  in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide
is as follows:

The format of the Bulk Data entry CTRIA3  in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide element is similar .
The material properties for the CQUAD4 and CTRIA3 are specified with the PSHELL or
PCOMP/PCOMPG entries.  The PCOMP/PCOMPG entry is specifically used for composites and is
discussed in Material Properties and Composites .  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

For all applications other than composites, the PSHELL entry should be used.  The format of the Bulk Data
entry PSHELL  in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide is as follows:
PSHELL
As can be seen, the PSHELL entry is used to define the material ID for the membrane properties, the bending
properties, the transverse shear properties, the bending-membrane coupling properties, and the bending and
transverse shear parameters.  By choosing the appropriate materials and parameters, virtually any plate
configuration may be obtained.
The most common use of the PSHELL entry is to model an isotropic thin plate.  The preferred method to
define an isotropic plate is to enter the same MAT1 ID for the membrane properties (MID1) and bending
properties (MID2) only and leave the other fields blank.  For a thick plate, you may also wish to enter an
MAT1 ID for the transverse shear (MID3).  The use of the PSHELL entry to model anisotropic plates is
discussed in Material Properties and Composites .
There are two ways you can input the thickness of the plate elements.  The simplest and the recommended
way is to enter a constant element thickness in field 4 of the PSHELL entry.  If the element has nonuniform
thickness, the thickness at each of the corner points is entered on the continuation line of the
CQUAD4/CTRIA3 connectivity entry.  If you enter the thickness on both the PSHELL entry and the
connectivity entry, the individual corner thicknesses take precedence.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Also located on the PSHELL entry are the stress recovery locations Z1 and Z2.  By default, Z1 and Z2 are
equal to one-half of the plate thickness (typical for a homogeneous plate).  If you are modeling a composite
plate, you may wish to enter values other than the defaults to identify the outermost fiber locations of the
plate for stress analysis.
The element coordinate systems  for the CQUAD4 is shown in Figure 4-43.  The orientation of the element
coordinate system is determined by the order of the connectivity for the grid points.  The element z-axis,
often referred to as the positive normal, is determined using the right-hand rule (the z-axis is “out of the
paper” as shown in Figure 4-43.  Therefore, if you change the order of the grid points connectivity, the
direction of this positive normal also reverses.  This rule is important to remember when applying pressure
loads or viewing the element forces or stresses.  Often element stress contours appear to be strange when they
are displayed by a postprocessor because the normals of the adjacent elements may be inconsistent.&lt;br&gt;
Remember that components of forces, moments, and element stresses are always output in the element
coordinate system.
Figure 4-43  CQUAD4 Element Geometry and Coordinate Systems
It can be seen from Figure 4-43 that each element has an element coordinate system and a material coordinate
system that may be the same or different.  Using a material coordinate system different for the element
coordinate system is useful when the material properties are orthotropic or anisotropic.  You may wish to
review these diagrams when you read Material Properties and Composites .
Figure 4-44 shows the positive directions of forces, moments, and stresses.  These diagrams are particularly
helpful in understanding the element force output generated when using the FORCE (or ELFORCE) Case

It is important to note that the output forces and moments generated by the shell elements are forces per unit
length.  A common error for new users is to assume that the force shown in the output is the total force acting
on the element&amp;ndash;it is not!  It is the force per unit length. Total forces and moments are output by the line and
solid elements.
Shown in Figure 4-44 are the stresses generated for a plate element.  The following summarizes the stresses
generated using the STRESS  (or ELSTRESS ) in the Case Control Section:
The derived quantities are defined in Sample Output Listings .  Similar output may be obtained for the element
strains using the STRAIN command in the Case Control Section.
By default, the element forces, stresses, and strains are generated for the centroid of the CQUAD4 and
CTRIA3 elements only.  You have the option to compute and output these quantities at the corner grid points
using the corner option for the CQUAD4 element.  For example, if you wish to obtain the corner stresses in
addition to the centroidal stress for the CQUAD4 elements, you request
STRESS(CORNER) = n         where n is a set of elements
or
STRESS(CORNER)=ALL  for all the elements
Hierarchy for Output Type
Currently only one output type is supported per run (i.e., CENTER and CORNER output types cannot be
mixed even for different output requests).  To determine this output type, you should use the following
hierarchy:
1.Only requests made in the first subcase and above the subcase level are considered when setting the
output type.  Subcases below the first are not considered for determining the output type (and the
output type is then set to CENTER, i.e., the default).
2.The output type of the STRESS request in the first subcase determines the output type for STRESS,
STRAIN, and FORCE for the entire run.
3.If there is no STRESS request in the first subcase, then the output type of the STRESS request above
the subcase level determines the output type for STRESS, STRAIN, and FORCE for the entire run.Mx, My  Bending moments on the x and y faces.
Mxy  T wisting moment.
x, y  Normal stresses in the x- and y-directions.
x, y  Shear stress  on the x face in the y-direction.
 Major and minor principal stress .
 Angle between the the x-axis and the major principal direction.  This angle is derived from x, y
and xy.
 von Mises  equivalent stress (or maximum shear stress if STRESS(MAXS) is used).  These stresses
are derived from x, y and xy.&lt;/p&gt;

4.If there is no STRESS request above or in the first subcase, then the output type of the STRAIN
request in the first subcase determines the output type for STRAIN and FORCE for the entire run.
5.If there is no STRAIN request in the first subcase, then the output type of the STRAIN request above
the subcase level determines the output type for STRAIN and FORCE for the entire run.
6.If there is no STRAIN request above or in the first subcase, then the output type of the FORCE
request in the first subcase determines the output type for FORCE for the entire run.
7.If there is no FORCE request in the first subcase, then the output type of the FORCE request above
the subcase level determines the output type for FORCE for the entire run.
If the corner output  is not used, the stresses are output in the element coordinate system for the center of the
element only.  For this example, the maximum normal X stress is 7500 psi.  However, if you compute the
stress at the fixed end using simple beam theory, the stress is 9000 psi.  This discrepancy occurs because the
7500 psi stress is computed at a distance of 5 inches from the fixed edge.  Although the example seems trivial,
most users use a postprocessor to view the results. If you only look at the contour plot you can easily be misled
if the maxiumum stress is not shown on the plot. To help reduce interpretation errors, the corner stress
output discussed earlier may be used.  Grid point stresses and stress discontinuity checks are also available.&lt;br&gt;
These features are discussed in Modeling Guidelines  and Model Verification .&lt;/p&gt;

Returning to the CQUAD4 and CTRIA3 element definition, you must specify four grid points for each
CQUAD4 and three grid points for each CTRIA3 element. These grid points define the corners of the
element.  The element, however, is elastically connected to only five of the six degrees of freedom at each of
its grid points.  The element does not provide direct elastic stiffness to the sixth degrees of freedom, i.e., the
rotation about the normal to the surface of the element.  Therefore, if a grid point is attached to the
CQUAD4 elements only and all of the elements are in the same plane, then the rotational degrees of freedom
about the surface normal have zero stiffness.  This zero stiffness results in a singular stiffness matrix and the
job fails.
By default, MSC Nastran removes most of these singularities with the AUTOSPC (Case) =YES Case Control
command being the default and the PARAM, K6ROT,100. Bulk Data entry being the default. Singularities not
removed by the defaults will show up in a Grid Point Singularity table such as Figure 4-39.
To avoid zero stiffness problems, identify the rotational degrees of freedom and constrain these components
using an SPC entry (either field 8 of the GRID entry or an SPC entry).  Make sure that you do not constrain
any components that have stiffness attached.  T o automatically identify and constrain those degrees of
freedom in the model that have no stiffness, you can set the PARAM,K6ROT,0.0 .  When this parameter is
used, a table is printed in the output file indicating which degrees of freedom in the model are constrained.
An example to force the Grid Point Singularity table output for the CQUAD4 element to model a flat
cantilever plate is shown in Figure 4-45. It is a good practice to review this table to ensure that the components
being constrained actually should be constrained and that no components are left unconstrained due to a
modeling error.
The default of 100. for K6ROT will eliminate the singularity associated with the normal rotation degree of
freedom by applying an artificial stiffness term to the degrees of freedom.  It is important to remember when
using this parameter that the stiffness being included for the rotational degree of freedom is not a true
stiffness and should not be used as such.  For example, if you need to connect a CBAR element to the
CQUAD4 element, you should not rely on the K6ROT stiffness to transfer the bending moment at the end
of the CBAR into the plate.  Various methods of transitioning different element types are discussed in
Modeling Guidelines .

AUTOSPC is used to constrain the rotational degrees of freedom normal to the plate.  Reviewing the grid
point singularity table output, as shown in Figure 4-46, you can see the rotational degrees of freedom (DOF 6
in this case) is removed from the f-set ( Free set) to the s-set ( SPC set). Matrix Operations  describes the sets used
in MSC Nastran.  The asterisk at the end of the lines indicates that the action was taken.

The displacement and stress output for the plate model are shown in Figure 4-47.
Figure 4-47  Displacement and Stress Output
Plate Element Strain Calculation
In addition to the stress output, you can also request strain  output for the plate element.  Deformation in the
X-Y plane of the plate element at any point C at a distance z in the normal direction to plate middle surface is
U = Uo + zy (4-5)
V = Vo - zx (4-6)
where U,V are the displacements in the element coordinate system, and x , y are the curvatures.  The Uo
and Vo are the plate mid-surface displacements.
The strain-displacement-middle surface strain and curvatures  relationship is given by
(4-7)
where the o’s and ’s are the middle surface strains and curvatures, respectively.D I S P L A C E M E N T   V E C T O R

You can request strain  output as strains at the reference plane and curvatures or strains at locations Z1 and
Z2.  The following strain output Case Control command
STRAIN = n
or
STRAIN(STRCUR) = n
requests strains and curvatures at the reference plane.  Similarly, the following strain output Case Control
command
STRAIN(FIBER) = n
requests strains at Z1 and Z2.  The example problem in Listing 4-10 contains two identical subcases except for
the strain output request format. (See MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/strain2.doc.) The output is shown in
Figure 4-48.  The first and second lines of the strain output for the first subcase represents the mean strains
and curvatures, respectively, at the reference plane.  The first and second lines of the strain output for the
second subcase represents the strains at the bottom (Z1) and top (Z2) fibers, respectively.
In a linear static analysis, the strain output are total strain&amp;ndash;mechanical plus thermal strain.

Figure 4-48  Strain Output for Plate Elements
Small Deflection Assumption
It is often of concern to the new user that the displacement for each grid point deflection is exclusively in the
Z-direction for this problem.  Physically, you know that there is a displacement in the X-direction when the
Z-displacement is as large as it is for this problem.  However, linear analysis assumes small deflections, and
as such, there is no deflection in the X-direction.&lt;br&gt;
If the deflection of the plate is significant enough that the in-plane forces cannot be ignored, a nonlinear
analysis may be warranted.  Such is the case for the cantilever plate model&amp;ndash;the deflections at the tip are over
5inches.  T o show a comparison, this same problem was run using Solution 106, a nonlinear statics solution.&lt;br&gt;
A plot showing the linear and nonlinear results is given in Figure 4-49.
Figure 4-49  Nonlinear vs. Linear Results
This example is not intended to show you how to perform a nonlinear analysis ; it serves only to remind you
that linear analysis means small deflections and the superposition principle applies.  For more information

The CQUAD8  and CTRIA6  Elements
The CQUAD8 and CTRIA6 elements are similar to the CQUAD4 and CTRIA3 elements except they may
also have midside grid points and curved edges.  The format of the Bulk Data entry CQUAD8  in the MSC
Nastran Quick Reference Guide  is as follows:
CQUAD8
The first four grid points on the CQUAD8 entry define the corners of the element and as such are required.&lt;br&gt;
The last four grid points define the midside grid points, any of which can be deleted (principally to
accommodate changes in mesh spacing, but deleting midside nodes in general is not recommended).  An edge
grid point need not lie on the straight line segment joining adjacent corner points.   However, it is
recommended that it be separated from the midpoint of the line by no more than twenty percent of the length
of the line.
The properties of the CQUAD8 and CTRIA6 elements are entered on the PSHELL element as described in
the previous section.  All of the capabilities described for the CQUAD4 element apply to the CQUAD8 and
CTRIA6 elements.  The principal advantage of the these elements is that they may be more accurate in curved
shell applications for the same number of degrees of freedom.  The disadvantage is that with the addition of
the midside node, they are more difficult to mesh for irregular shape structures.
The element coordinate system  is defined implicitly by the location and connection order of the grid points
as is the case for the CQUAD4 and CTRIA3.  The element coordinate systems for these elements are
described in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide .
If the element force, stress, and strain outputs are requested in the Case Control Section, they are always
output at both the centroid of the element and at the corner locations.  Recalling the element data recovery
method for the CQUAD4, if you wish corner values to be output, they must be requested using the corner
option.  The corner option does not apply to the CQUAD8, CTRIA3, or CTRIA6 element.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Shell Element in the Material Coordinate System
For the CQUAD4, CTRIA3, CQUAD8, and CTRIA6 elements, a parameter is available to request the
element response quantities in the material coordinate system. This capability is limited to element force,
stress, and strain responses and provides output in the coordinate system defined using the THETA/ MCID
field on their associated bulk data entries.  Both element center and element corner results are output in the
material system. This capability must be used with care because the output of element results in the material
coordinate system can produce incorrect results in subsequent calculations that assume the element results
are in the element coordinate system. By default, the results for the shell elements are produced in the element
coordinate system. The element coordinate system is an artifact of the meshing option chosen to discretize
the model and, in the typical case, does not have a physical interpretation.  On the other hand, the output
of results in a specified coordinate system does have physical meaning and allows the user to scan results
across elements and be assured that they have been output in a common coordinate system.
To view results in the material coordinate system, set PARAM, OMID,YES. The default value for OMID is
NO.
The parameter should not be used if grid point stresses are required or if the results are to be displayed by a
postprocessor. The calculation of grid point stresses is based on element stress results with the assumption
that the element responses are in the element coordinate system. Postprocessors, such as Patran, assume
element results are in the element coordinate system, thereby producing incorrect values if they are not in
that system.
Figure 4-50 contains the strain output from two different runs of the same model, one with
PARAM,OMID,YES and the other with PARAM,OMID,NO. Differences are seen in the labeling that
indicates how the NORMAL-X, NORMAL-Y, AND SHEAR-XY results are output and in the results
themselves.  In this case, the material axis is at a 45 degree angle with respect to the element axis and this
value is reflected in the difference in the angle listed under the PRINCIPAL STRAINS heading.  Similar
differences can be seen in the stress output, where as the force output has an additional label indicating that
results are in the material coordinate system when OMID is set to YES. The standard force output does not
include this label.  See Figure 4-51.

Figure 4-51  Element Force Output Labeling with  PARAM OMID=YES
The user must keep track of the value of the OMID parameter when working with the .pch file because there
is no labeling for the punch output. It is suggested that the user include the value of this parameter in the job
TITLE so that it will appear at the head of the .pch file.
The forces, stress, and strains in the material coordinate system may only be printed or punched and are NOT
written to the .op2 or .xdb files. The usual element coordinate system results are written to the .op2 or .xdb
file if they are requested (param,post,x).
The OMID parameter is intended to provide a quick look at results that are in a consistent coordinate system
so that one can easily and meaningfully scan these results across a number of elements.  If these data are to
be incorporated into design formulae, it removes the requirement that they first be transformed into a
consistent coordinate system.   Of course, the invariant principal stress/strain results have always provided
mesh independent results.
The CQUADR  and CTRIAR  Elements
The Bulk Data entries CQUADR  and CTRIAR  are identical to the CQUAD4 and CTRIAR, however the
CQUADR and CTRIAR plate elements take advantage of the normal rotational degrees of freedom (which
have no stiffness associated with them in the standard plate elements) to provide improved membrane
accuracy. The result is an element with stiffness in all six degrees of freedom at each grid point. However, this
additional stiffness is not a true physical stiffness. The shell normal should be turned on when using the
CQUADR and CTRIAR elements. It is recommended that you do not mix elements of different
formulations in your model.  For example, you should not model part of a structure with the CQUAD4 and
CTRIA3 elements and another part with the CQUADR and CTRIAR elements. Using System Cell QRMETH
(370) you can convert from one form to the other for comparisons. For a more detailed description of the
CQUADR and CTRIAR entries, see QUADR and TRIAR Elements  in the MSC Nastran Reference Guide.
The Shear Panel Element (CSHEAR )
The CSHEAR element is a quadrilateral element with four grid points.  The element models a thin buckled
plate.  It supports shear stress in its interior and also extensional force between adjacent grid points.  Typically
you use the CSHEAR element in situations where the bending stiffness and axial membrane stiffness of the
plate is negligible.  The use of CQUAD4 element in such situations results in an overly stiff model.

The most important application of the CSHEAR element is in the analysis of thin reinforced plates and
shells, such as thin aircraft skin panels.  In such applications, reinforcing rods (or beams) carry the extensional
load, and the CSHEAR element carries the in-plane shear.  This is particularly true if the real panel is buckled
or if it is curved.  The format of the Bulk Data entry CSHEAR  in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide is as

Two-Dimensional Crack Tip Element (CRAC2D )
The two-dimensional crack tip element is used to model surfaces with a discontinuity due to a crack.  The
connectivity of the element is entered on the CRAC2D entry.  The formats of the Bulk Data entries CRAC2D&lt;br&gt;
and ADUMi  in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide are as follows:
CRAC2D
ADUM8
Note the use of the ADUM8  entry.  This is due to the fact that the CRAC2D element is not a fully
implemented element and as such requires additional input.  The element is what is known as a “dummy”
element. A dummy element is one that has been implemented using one of the prototype element routines.&lt;br&gt;
These prototype element routines (which are known as dummy routines) are in every release of MSC Nastran
for the advanced user to add their own elements to the element library.  The crack tip elements are added as
dummy element for expediency only.  The CRAC2D element is dummy element 8; and therefore, the Bulk
Data entry ADUM8 must be used with this element.

The CRAC2D geometry is depicted in Figure 4-53.  T wo acceptable geometries are shown.  Grid points 1
through 10 are required; grid points 11 through 18 are optional.  The element may be plane stress or plane
strain.  You may specify a quadrilateral or a symmetric half option.  For the quadrilateral option, MSC
Nastran automatically divides the element into eight basic triangular elements.  For the symmetric half-crack
option, the program subdivides the element into four basic triangular elements.  Only grid points 1 through
7 are required for the symmetric option; grid points 11 through 14 are optional.  For the quadrilateral option,
the stresses are computed by averaging the stresses from triangles 4 and 5, and the stress intensity factors  Ki
and Kii are computed from triangles 1 and 8.  For the symmetric option, the stress is determined from triangle
4, and the stress intensity factor Ki is computed from triangle 1 only.
The CRAC2D element is based on a two-dimensional formulation, but it may be used for three-dimensional
planar structures.  Deviation from a planar element is checked and any significant deviation results in a
printed error message.Field Contents

Three-Dimensional Elements
Three-dimensional elements, commonly referred to as solid elements, are used to model structures that
cannot be modeled using beam or plate elements. For instance, a solid element is used to model an engine
block because of the latter’s three-dimensional nature. If however, you are creating a model of the automobile
hood, the best choice is one of the plate elements; you do not want to use the solid elements in this case.
The solid elements discussed in this section are the CHEXA, CPENTA, CPYRAM,  CTETRA, CTRIAX6,
and CRAC3D element. The CTRIAX6 element is an axisymmetric element that is used for axisymmetric
analysis only. The CRAC3D element is a three-dimensional crack tip element.
The CHEXA, CPENTA, CPYRAM  and CTETRA elements are a family of elements used for general
modeling applications. They differ from each other primarily in the number of faces and in the number of
connected grid points.
The CHEXA , CPENTA , CPYRAM  and CTETRA  Elements
The CHEXA element (brick element  with six faces) is the most commonly used solid element in the
MSC Nastran element library. The CPENTA (a wedge element  with five faces), CPYRAM (a pyramid
element with five faces)  and CTETRA tetrahedral element  with four faces) are used mainly for mesh
transitions and in areas where the CHEXA element is too distorted.
The connectivity information for the elements is entered on the CHEXA, CPENTA, CPYRAM  and
CTETRA entries. For discussion, the format of the Bulk Data entry CHEXA  in the MSC Nastran Quick
Reference Guide  is included below. The formats of the CPENTA, CPYRAM  and CTETRA are similar to that
of the CHEXA and therefore are not included.

Figure 4-54  CHEXA Element Connection
As can be seen, the CHEXA element is defined by eight corner grid points and up to twelve optional midside
grid points.  It is important that you observe the ordering of the grid point IDs on the connectivity entries.&lt;br&gt;
For example, grid point G12 must lie between grid points G1 and G4.  Deviation from the ordering scheme
will result in a fatal error, or worse - bad answers.  It is not necessary that the midside grid points lie on a
straight line between their respective corner grid points.  However, it is advisable to keep the edges reasonably
straight.  In other words, avoid highly distorted elements.
Similar to the case for the CQUAD8 element, any or all of the midside nodes for the CHEXA element may
be deleted.  However, it is recommended that if midside nodes are used, then all midside grid points be
included.  The 8-noded or the 20-noded CHEXA should be used in areas where accurate stress data recovery
is required.
Solid elements contain stiffness only in the translation degrees of freedom at each grid point.  Similar to the
normal rotational degrees of freedom for the CQUAD4, you should be aware of the potential singularities
due to the rotational degrees of freedom for the solid elements.  You may either constrain the singular degrees
of freedom manually or have MSC Nastran automatically identify and constrain them, i.e., the default for
the AUTOSPC  Case Control command.  The parameter K6ROT does not affect the solid elements.  Also
any combination of the solid elements with elements that can transmit moments require special modeling.&lt;br&gt;
Transitioning elements is discussed in Modeling Guidelines .
The properties of the solid elements are entered on the PSOLID entry.  The format of the Bulk Data entry
PSOLID  in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide is as follows:

The PSOLID entry provides you with an option to define a material coordinate system that can be used to
define the material property (an example of this is in Material Properties and Composites  (Ch. 5)) and also to
obtain stresses.  The PSOLID entry also provides you with some control over the integration technique used
for the element.  The CHEXA and the CPENTA are modified isoparametric elements that use selective
integration points for different components of strain.  There are two different networks of integration points
available, each of whose selection depends on the presence of any midside grid points.
The default integration schemes may be overridden with field 7 of the PSOLID entry.  In general, it is
recommended that you use the default value.  An override of the default values is available if you are familiar
with element theory and have a particular modeling need; otherwise, use the defaults.
A laminate composite shell or solid can be analyzed by using the PCOMPLS  entry referencing a CHEXA
element, but only in SOL 400.
The element coordinate system of the solid elements can be affected by the skew of the elements.  The best
way to explain the element coordinate system  is to describe how it is generated for the CHEXA.  As an
example, consider the skewed CHEXA element as shown in Figure 4-55.Field Contents

Figure 4-55  CHEXA Element Coordinate System
The first step in generating the element coordinate system is to define three intermediate axes called R, S,
and T .  The R vector always joins the centroids of the faces G4-G1-G5-G8 and G3-G2-G6-G7.  The S vector
always joins the faces of G1-G2-G6-G5 and G4-G3-G7-G8.  The T vector always joins the faces of G1-G2-
G3-G4 and G5-G6-G7-G8.  The origin of the coordinate system lies at the intersection of the these three
vectors.  The R, S, and T vectors are not, in general, orthogonal to each other.  They are used to define a set
of orthogonal vectors R’, S’, and T’ by performing an eigenvalue analysis.  The element’s x-, y-, and z-axes
are then aligned with the same element faces as the R’, S’, and T’ vectors.  Since this method does not orient
the RST vectors by the grid point IDs, a small perturbation in the geometry does not cause the element
coordinate system to change drastically.
This method for the element coordinate system definition provides for more consistent data for
postprocessing.  However, one drawback is that the actual orientation of the elemental axes is not provided.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore, to simplify your work in understanding the stress results, it is advisable not to output stress in the
element coordinate system.  T o output the stress in the basic or any user-defined coordinate system, simply
enter the appropriate integer in field 4 of the PSOLID  entry.  The default coordinate system for the stress
output is the basic coordinate system.
As an example of the CHEXA element, consider the tapered beam that was first discussed in One-Dimensional
Elements .  The dimensions of the tapered beam are shown in Figure 4-19.  Suppose the CBEAM model does
not provide the detailed stress contours that you need for your analysis, so you decide to generate a finer solid
model.  An example of such a model is shown in Figure 4-56.  The detailed model consists of 3840 CHEXA
elements resulting in 15,435 degrees of freedom in the model.  Note that four elements are used to model
the thickness of the flanges and the web.  Four elements are used in order to capture the stress variation T

through the thickness.  A common mistake is not having enough elements across the thickness.  Also shown
in Figure 4-56 are deformed plots resulting from the end load.
The input file is not included due to its large size, but it is available on the deliver media. (See
MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat/solid1.dat.)
Figure 4-56  Tapered Beam Solid Element Model
The CTETRA element is an isoparametric tetrahedron element with four vertex nodes and up to six
additional edge nodes.  If you use edge nodes, it is recommended that you include all six nodes.  The accuracy
of the element degrades if some but not all of the edge grid points are used.  It is a good modeling practice to
keep the use of the 4-noded CTETRA to a minimum, especially in the areas of high stress.
By default, the stress output for the solid elements is at the center and at each of the corner points.  If no
midside nodes are used, you may request the stress output at the Gauss points instead of the corner points by
setting field 6 of the PSOLID entry to “GAUSS” or 1.
The CTRIAX6  Element
The Bulk Data entry CTRIA6  in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide is a “solid of revolution” element with
a triangular cross section.  You must supply the three corner grid points and may optionally supply up to three
midside nodes.  The only application of the CTRIAX6 element is the analysis of axisymmetric structures with
axisymmetric loads.  This application should not be confused with the cyclic symmetric capability within
MSC Nastran, which can handle both axisymmetric and nonaxisymmetric loading.&lt;/p&gt;

Three-Dimensional Crack Tip Element (CRAC3D )
The three-dimensional crack tip element is used to model solids with a discontinuity due to a crack.  Like
the CRAC2D, the CRAC3D is also a dummy element&amp;ndash;you must specify the ADUM9  entry in the Bulk
Data Section.  The connectivity is entered on the CRAC3D entry.  The formats of the Bulk Data entries

You have two options available, the brick option and the symmetric option.  When the brick option is used,
MSC Nastran automatically subdivides the element into eight basic wedges.  When you specify the
symmetric option, MSC Nastran subdivides the element into four wedges.  For the brick option, the stresses
are computed from wedges 4 and 5, and the stress intensity factors Ki and Kii are computed from wedges 1
and 8.  When the symmetric option is used, the stress is computed from wedge 4, and the stress intensity
factor Ki is computed from wedge 1 only.
The CRAC3D element is based upon a 3-D formulation.  Both of the faces (formed by grid points 1 through
18 and grid points 19 through 36) and that of the midplane (grid 37 through 46) should be planar.  Any
significant deviation will result in an error message.Field Contents
