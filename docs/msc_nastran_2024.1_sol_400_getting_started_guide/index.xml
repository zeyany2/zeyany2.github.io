Help Us Help You
Clients frequently call up the support engineers at Hexagon with enquiry regarding models that do not run
correctly. Our  technical support staff can help you much more efficiently and effectively if you are working
with a small model, since  debugging a small model is much easier, and the turnaround time to rerun a
(hopefully) corrected test model is minutes  rather than hours.

Iteration Control in Nonlinear Analysis
Main Index
Requesting Output For a Step
Creating a step includes requesting output.
You must suppress your output as much as possible. (As nonlinear jobs can quickly fill up your
disk) .
•Usually you will output results at every so many increments to reduce the size of the output file .
•Results are written in file job_id.op2/master/dball , which must be read back for
postprocessing, including visualizing results
Defining Subcases in Patran
To define a subcase:
1.Click on the Analysis Application  button to bring up the Analysis Application form.
2.From the Analysis Application  form click Subcases .
Define History by Selecting Load Steps
Creating a step includes selecting load cases .
Create the load steps to define the load history. The load step selection order specifies the order in
which loads, and boundary conditions are applied .
Make sure that you are specifying total load, and not the incremental load. Put all loads in the load
case that belong to the step, even those you already used in the previous general step.
Only those steps that are selected will be included in the analysis .&lt;/p&gt;

Main Index
Overview
Sometimes you may receive non-convergence error messages when a job does not converge. In such a
scenario, review the following diagnostics tools to help you:
The fatal error message
Plot results from converged increment s
The .sts  file
The .f06  file
The .log  file
Review Fatal Error Message
Even with a fatal error message, there are still insights to be gained from the completed increments.
For details, go the end of the .f06  file and search up for % . The nonlinear iteration printout will provide
helpful diagnostics on your job&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;183 CHAPTER 11
Trouble Shooting
Main Index
The % symbol does not mean percent. It is a convenient way for you to search for the iteration printout.  A
few key things to look for are highlighted in the figure.
Review the .sts File
SOL 400 produces a status file jobname.sts  hat can be queried periodically to see how the analysis is
progressing and if the job is completed. It is very useful for assessing if the analysis has completed  successfully,
and, if not, how much of it was completed before the analysis was terminated. This is extremely useful&lt;br&gt;
because the most common problem with obtaining nonlinear solutions is avoiding, detecting, and managing&lt;br&gt;
convergence problems.
The easiest way to have a real-time monitor of your SOL 400 job is to open the .sts  file with a text editor
that automatically updates when the file is changed.
The information in this file is especially important when manual or automatic time stepping procedures are
being used to step through an analysis procedure. One line is written after each successful increment. A
typical STS file is shown as follows. Its content is well self-explained by the file itself.  The file below may be
slightly different than the final version.
The first column shows the procedural step, while the second column shows the increment within the step.
Not every increment size is equal, as can be seen in the TIME STEP OF INC  column. The third column
(cycl # ) indicates the number of attempts made during this increment.
The status file is updated in real time so a running job can be monitored. Review the .sts  file. Check for
the following:
Did the job finish normally?
How far did the job get to?
What is the maximum displacement?
•Is the job running away?
•Does the maximum displacement  make sense? I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran: SOL 400 Getting Started Manual
Review the .f06 File184
Main Index
Did it have a lot of cutbacks?
•Are there many cutbacks (bi-sections)?&lt;br&gt;
•Are the increments are too large?
Did it have a lot of separations
•Are there many separations (contact analysis)?&lt;br&gt;
•Investigate the contact parameters.
What is the total number of cycles?
•What is the total number of cycles (iterations?
•Is this equal to the number of matrix assembly and decompositions?&lt;br&gt;
•Can I reduce this to improve run time?
Also review the exit definition. It will inform you if the job terminated normally or abnormally. You can then
check the .f06  file for more information.
Patran provides a convenient way to access the status file using the Monitor  option of the Analysis  form.&lt;br&gt;
Review the .f06 File
The keyword search option in the .f06  file makes it easy to find errors in the SOL 400 run by searching the
file for fatal message to immediately find the fatal error that terminated the job).
When reviewing the .f06  file, do the following:
Review NLSTEP parameters

SOL 400 A nalysis  Messages
MSC Nastran generates a substantial amount of information concerning the problem being executed.
The.f04 file provides information on the sequence of modules being executed and the time required by each
of the modules; the .log  file contains system messages.
MSC Nastran may terminate as a result of errors detected by the operating system or by the program. If the
DIAG 44 is set, MSC Nastran will produce a dump of several key internal tables when most of these errors
occur. Before the dump occurs, there may be a fatal message written to the .f06  file. The general format of
this message is&lt;/p&gt;

Some messages, like FATAL ERRORS  or other text issued whenever an interrupt occurs that MSC Nastran
is unable to satisfactorily process. The specific reasons for the interrupt are usually printed in the .f06&lt;br&gt;

For example, in SOL 400, nonlinear analysis may be terminated by divergence. When it occurs, FATAL

MSC Nastran has only two exit number, i.e.,
•0: normal exit
•-1: fatal error
MSC Nastran provides many user fatal error messages ( UFM). A normal/successful run exit message is as
follows:
For a job that terminates abnormally you are referred to the FATAL ERROR MESSAGE  in the jobname.f06&lt;br&gt;
file.
One way to debug convergence issues is to use the NLOPRM  bulk data entry, such as NLDBG = ADVDBG,&lt;br&gt;
DBGPOST  options and so on, to load increment diagnostics in the .f06  file, which may help debug the
model. Each iteration of each load increment generates a report in the .f06  file giving the convergence and
stiffness update information.
If the job terminates before 100% of the loading is applied this convergence information can be used to
identify possible reasons. The default numerical method used by SOL 400 is the full Newton method with
the load increment size adjusted according to how many iterations are required to achieve convergence. The
incremental load size will be adjusted up if convergence is achieved easily, and will be reduced if more than
the target number of iterations is required to achieve convergence.
Convergence is achieved when the error factors on the selected criteria are below the required values (called
the convergence criteria). In this convergence and stiffness update information, the following values are
given:
LOAD STEP : percentage of total load reached at this incremental load value
NO. INC : increment number of this increment relative to all increments in this step
ITR: number of iterations required to get convergence in this load increment

Reviewing Convergence
From a user’s perspective, when performing a nonlinear simulation, the most difficult thing is to resolve
convergence problems encountered in the analysis.
In MSC Nastran, convergence may refer to:
Convergence in the iterative solver
Convergence in eigenvalue extraction
Convergence in aero-elasticity flutter calculation
Convergence in optimization
Convergence in equilibrium.
In this section, we will only be focusing on convergence equilibrium of the structural system.  Figure 11-2 gives
a quick summpar of steps you should undertake.
For structural analysis, a lack of convergence implies that the numerical solution has not reached equilibrium
to the desired level of accuracy. Even if convergence is achieved, it is strongly recommended to determine how
many iterations were required and to consider if this was a reasonable number or an excessive number.
Recall that the number of iterations has a significant influence on the computational costs, so not only is there
the requirement that the solution converges, but that it also converges efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

Reviewing the MSC Analysis Manager
The Analysis Manager  provides interfaces within Patran to submit, monitor and manage analysis jobs on
local and remote networked systems. It can also operate in a stand-alone mode directly with MSC Nastran.
The Analysis Manager  automates the process of running analysis software even on remote and dissimilar
platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran: SOL 400 Getting Started Manual
Tips for Starting with Nonlinear Analysis194
Main Index
Files are automatically copied to where they are needed, the analysis is performed and pertinent information
is relayed back to you. When the analysis is complete files are returned/deleted. Time consuming system tasks
are reduced so that more time is available for productive engineering.
The Analysis Manager  can also be used to monitor job progress (even non-jobs)
Shows all job and host information
Abort function can be used to stop running jobs
Tips for Starting with Nonlinear Analysis
Start your model simple and gradually add complexity. It is better to start the analysis with a small load that
will obtain convergence than start with a large load that requires the program to subdivide the increment.
When starting with a new model, set up your model such that you get some initial results or a run-failure
within a few minutes. This means that you may need to start with a coarse mesh.
Once you know your model runs to completion, you can add refinement and/or complexity. As a general
comment, a 1000-2000 node job would fail within few minutes if there are set-up errors. This is what we
want: if the job fails, it should fail fast. These initial few runs serve the purpose of testing the set-up
parameters to make sure that they work right for this model. You can expect to make a few/several runs to
determine that the parameters are correct for that class of problems.
Once these parameters are known, you can apply them to other models in that class of problems. Once the
job runs to completion, you can add complexity/refinement. Now the job will take longer, but we are
confident that it will run to completion.
Displacement control: In general, problems with applied displacements are numerically more stable  than
problems with applied forces. For example, if a cantilever beam loaded at the end with a force, formation of
a plastic hinge can make the model go non-positive definite. With an applied displacement, this scenario is
less likely.
Output Messages
Additional Output
When convergence is a problem it is necessary to obtain as much information as possible on the numerical
process. The NLOPRM  case control command is used to obtain additional result information.
In particular:
NLOPRM       OUTCTRL=STD,INTERIM, NLDBG=NLBASIC,NRDBG, DBGPOST=LTIME
will provide the additional information to evaluate the performance. If contact bodies are present, it may be
preferable to use:
NLOPRM       OUTCTRL=STD,INTERIM, NLDBG=NLBASIC,NRDBG, DVDBG,N3DMED
DBGPOST=LTIME&lt;/p&gt;

Standard User Fatal Messages
If you run the analys is and it does not run at all or ends before  completing, you will get an error message in  the
jobname.f06  or jobname.log   file that will give you an indication of what the problem  is. Do  a text
search on the word  fatal in the jobname.f06   file. The first thing to check  is to that you were able to get a
license to run the job. Licensing problems are a common reasons for  a run  to fail. If you  are sure you have a
license and submit the job correct ly, you should get a jobname.sts   file that will end with an exit number&lt;br&gt;
preceded  by a description  of why the run stopped.&lt;br&gt;
Common exit numbers  are:
If you receive a Nastran input from another source, it is strongly recommended that you read it into either
Patran or SimXpert and display the model to check for completeness. Any .sts  file with nonzero total time
lines means there are converged increments. Display the conve rged increments  to see what  is going  on.

If a UFM  message similar to the above comes as soon as the job is submitted; i.e., at the first
assembly of the first iterati on, it indicates a meshing problem. Re-check  mesh and re-mesh.
If an increment or iteration has been successfully completed and one gets the message:

Tips for Starting with Nonlinear Analysis196
Main Index
This exit message or a similar one may  indicate excessi ve element deforma tion during a particular&lt;br&gt;
load increme nt in a particular iterati on. The way to get around this error is to reduce  step size.
Howe ver, SOL 400 does that automatically  and if the problem still persists, it gives this message. If
the program is unable to recover after several cutbacks, it implies that the last converged solution is
not really a good solution or the deformation is excessive for this mesh. The solution may be to
either use Restart or rerun-the complete analysis with a tighter tolerance.
It may be necessary to change the original mesh to anticipate where the deformation will occur. Also,
it should be recognized that lower-order triangular or tetrahedral elements (with PSLDN1 ) is the
preferred solution for large strain/distortion models.
User-specified Upper Limit on Number of Iterations:  The solution may fail and give this message if
SOL 400 reaches the user-specified upper limit on the number of (Newton-Raphson) iterations
within a load increment. The default is set to 10. One of the first things to try, if you think the
problem is otherwise well posed (e.g., no other problems are known) would be to increase the value
(specified on NLSTEP ) to a value of 20.
What is happening is that SOL400 keeps iterating and tries to converge to a solution for that
increment. If that does not happen, SOL 400 will cut back the load (by half) and re-solve that
increment. Sometimes this is not enough to get convergence, and it will exit with a UFM.
Check the residual values in the ADVDBG  section of the .f06  file to confirm this.
Minimum Time Step Size Exceeded/Time-Step Size Too Small:  This exit message indicates that
SOL 400 cuts back to a time-step size too small for the analysis to continue. The load stepping
algorithm has a cut-back feature where the load step is automatically reduced (when the time step is
decreased, the factor is calculated internally based upon the minimum time step).
When an increment runs into these problems, it automatically cuts the load-step size and resolve
that increment. If the problem persists, it cut-back the load-step again. This happens until the limit
of the number of cut-backs is reached. This can result in a very small time step. In such a case, SOL
400 stops the analysis with a UFM.
Allowable Number of Bisections Exceeded: SOL 400&amp;rsquo;s automatic load stepping scheme is set up
such that the applied load in an increment scales up (or down) depending on how easy (or difficult)
the solution was in the previous increment.
The degree of difficulty is determined based on the NDESIR  parameter of NLSTEP : desired
number of iterations per increment  (default = 4). SOL 400 will scale down the step size
until it reaches a lower limit on the step size (default = 0.001% of total time step) and then exit with
a UFM worded similar to the above. This is an indication to you that the analysis encountered some
difficulty at that stage.&lt;/p&gt;

Frequently Asked Questions
Main Index
Q1:Is SOL 400 only for nonlinear analysis, or can I also do linear analysis?
SOL 400 can do linear, nonlinear, modal, buckling, and transient structural analysis along with a
host of other analysis types. SOL 400 is designed to be the only solution sequence you need. For a
complete list, see ANALYSIS  case control entry documentation in the  Quick Reference Guide .
Q2:Will I get the same results from a SOL 400 linear analysis as I do from a SOL 101 analysis?
SOL 400 has additional capabilities that require controls not available in SOL 101. This means the
additional controls for a SOL 400 analysis must be set in the same way as they are for a SOL 101
analysis.
Having said that, SOL 400 control defaults are set in such a way that you should get the same results
from a SOL 400 analysis that you do from a SOL 101 analysis.
Q3:Will I get the same results from a SOL 400 nonlinear analysis as I do from a SOL 106 static or SOL 129
transient nonlinear analysis?
There are additional capabilities and additional controls in SOL 400 that must be set in the same
way as they are for SOL 106 or SOL 129 in order to get the same results. Also, SOL 400 has a
complete set of large strain elements that make it unlikely that you will get the same solution unless
you are performing a small deformation analysis.
However, if you set your analysis up to use the same elements as the SOL 106 or 129 solution, and
you limit the conditions applied to the model you should get the same results as a SOL 106 or 129
analysis.
Q4:Will I get the same results from a SOL 400 linear, modal, buckling, or nonlinear analysis as I will from
a SOL 101, 103, 105, and 106 analysis?
SOL 400 encapsulates those solution sequences and should be able to reproduce their results.
Getting the same answers requires equivalence in element types, analysis control settings, and
procedures.
Q5:Is it possible to use the same model for linear and nonlinear analysis. If so what is the best way to add
the additional input required for the nonlinear solution to an existing linear model?
Yes. SOL 400 has been designed to allow you use the same model for linear and nonlinear analysis.
To accomplish this, do the following:
a.Take the linear model.
b.Read it into a graphical pre-and post processor like Patran.
c.Add the additional model attributes required such as contact.
d.Make sure to specify the proper nonlinear analysis control parameters.
e.Let the graphical pre- postprocessor write out the correct input.
Q6:Is it possible to convert an existing MSC Nastran model into a SOL 400 model? If so what is the best
way to do this?
Yes, you can convert an existing MSC Nastran model into a SOL 400 model. To accomplish this, do
the following:
a.Take the existing MSC Nastran model .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran: SOL 400 Getting Started Manual 200

b.Read it into a graphical pre-and post processor like Patran or SimXpert.
c.Add the additional model attributes required such as contact or nonlinear materials properties .
d.Specify the proper nonlinear analysis control parameters.
e.Let the graphical pre- postprocessor write out the correct input.
See Chapter 6: Setting Up, Monitoring, and Debugging the Analysis  for an example of the process required to
convert a SOL 101 model to a SOL 400 model.
Q7:Is it possible to take an existing Abaqus model and convert it into a SOL 400 model? If so what is the
best way to do this? Will I get the same answer?
Starting with the 2014 release, a translator is can be used to convert an Abaqus input file into an
MSC Nastran input file. Prior to that, do the following:
a.Read the file into Patran.
b.Change the preference to MSC Nastran.
c.Add the additional data.
Getting the same answer depends on many factors:
a.Compatibility of the element types selected
b.Analysis capabilities and algorithms (such as contact algorithms)
c.Analysis procedures
d.Selected controls
In particular, characterization of contact interactions may affect the results.
Q8:Does Patran/SimXpert support SOL 400?
While Patran/SimXpery do not support 100% of SOL 400 capabilities, they provide complete
support of the most commonly used features of SOL 400 including nonlinear materials, contact,
composites, and multi stepping/perturbation analysis. MSC is continuing to develop them to
support new SOL 400 capabilities.
Q9:If I am new to SOL 400 what&amp;rsquo;s the best way to learn it?
There are a few ways of learning:
•The MSC documentation system has a complete set of solved SOL 400 problems in a document
called the MSC Nastran Demonstration Problems . The input files from these solved problems are
included in the documentation system.
•Patran has a set of demo problems that can be found in the Analysis  menu, under the Run a
Demo  tab. After running these demos, Patran can be used to interrogate the model and investigate
how the models are set up.
•The SimCompanion website has a knowledge base with answers to commonly asked questions,
as well as links to the MSC training courses on SOL 400.
Q10: Where can I find example input files for SOL 400 demo problems?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;201 CHAPTER A
Frequently Asked Questions
Main Index
Example problems can be found in the MSC Nastran Demonstration Problems Manual . These
example problems also include input files. There is a test suite of example input files in the MSC
Nastran test problem library. Also, the Run a Demo  problems in Patran will leave the input files
that were used to run the example.
Q11: What kind of results are supported in the op2, xdb, HDF5, and/or dball/master?
While you can request SOL 400 output in any valid MSC Nastran output format, only the
MASTER /DBALL  and new OP2 (PARAM,POST,1 ) and HDF5  formats will contain all of the results
data blocks of SOL 400.
Specifically, the nonlinear stress/strain and contact results data blocks will be missing if any other
format is requested. Thus, MSC strongly recommends that you use MASTER /DBALL , new OP2, or
HDF5  output formats for SOL 400 solutions.
Q12: What do I do if I run the analysis and do not get a solution? What if it does not converge?
Check the solution files ( *.f06 , *.log , *.f04 ) to look for error messages. Typically there will be
a message telling why the solution did not converge.
There are a couple of answers to this question depending on why the analysis did not get a solution.
Reasons why an analysis does not result in a solution can be grouped into two categories.
•The first group relates to having a correctly formatted input file. These tend to be the most
common, and also the easiest to fix.
•The second group relates to having what might be called a well-posed problem .
This means that our problem does not violate any of the laws of physics, and that there actually
is a valid numerical solution to the problem we are trying to solve. A typical example of this type
of error would be trying to come up with a static solution to a problem that is not statically
determinate. There are methods used to determine if a model is properly constrained, such as
running a modal analysis to look for unconstrained rigid body modes.
Q13: How do I know if I need to do a nonlinear analysis?
While this is not an exact answer as loading conditions will affect this, you should do a nonlinear
analysis in one of the following conditions:
•If your strains are approaching 5%
•The deflection of any node in your model approaches 5% of the smallest dimension.
Q14: How do I know if linear contact will give me the right answer, or if I need to do a nonlinear analysis?
The term linear contact  is an oxymoron. The very nature of contact problems are that finite
deformation of the nodes must be tracked to determine if the notes are in contact or not in contact.
This deformation is almost always large enough to invalidate linear contact solutions. The best use
for linear contact is to use it to connect dissimilar meshes or full assembly modeling where no
separation occurs.
Q15: What is the difference between linear buckling analysis and nonlinear buckling analysis?
A linear buckling analysis is based on the un-deformed configuration of the structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran: SOL 400 Getting Started Manual 202
Main Index
A nonlinear buckling analysis is based on a deformed shape of the structure. The deformation and
stresses make the structure stiffer (if in tension) and cause the natural frequencies to increase. Hence,
it is often necessary to do a nonlinear buckling analysis to get accurate mode shapes and frequencies.
Q16: What is a stress stiffened model analysis?
Before extracting the eigenvalues from the structural system, the model may be pre-loaded prior to
the modal extraction. Initial stress effects are then included in the stiffness which tend to raise the
eigenvalues. This effect tends to affect the eigenvalues more than the eigenvectors (mode shapes).
Q17: Will RBE&amp;rsquo;s rotate with the rest of the model?
If a large displacement, nonlinear analysis is performed, then yes, the RBEs rotates with the model.
In a linear analysis, the displacement and rotation of the nodes is assumed to be infinitesimally small.
Q18: What are Marc elements? When would I use them? How do I activate them?
Most MSC Nastran elements, also  called Advanced nonlinear elements or large strain elements were
originally formulated for linear analysis. At some point, some of those original elements were
modified for use in nonlinear analysis (SOLs 106 and 129), but certainly not all of them.
•Instead of developing new elements and capabilities from scratch for SOL 400, MSC Nastran
decided to copy the well-proven, robust, mature large deformation/large strain analysis
procedures and element formulations from Marc.
•Instead of developing new nonlinear element designations, which would have increased work to
convert a linear SOL 101 model to a SOL 400 nonlinear model, MSC Nastran decided to use the
same element designations and allow you to control the formulation used through secondary
property entries such as PBEMN1 , PSHLN1 , PSHNL2 , and PSLDN1 .
While this method gives you direct control over the element formulation, SOL 400 automatically
selects the proper formulation for the problem. This means that if the problem is a large
deformation, large strain problem, SOL 400 automatically uses the large strain element
formulation.
Unless you want to directly control the formulation (such as use reduced integration or some
other special formulation), it is best to allow MSC Nastran to select the formulation used. This
also means that no additional input is required.
Q19: Do shell and beam offsets rotate with the model?
Yes, if MDLPRM ,OFFDEF ,LROFF  is set in the deck when parameter LGDISP&amp;gt;=0 .
Q20: Will CBAR  elements rotate with the model?
Yes, if CBAR  is converted to a CBEAM .
Q21: Will CGAP  elements rotate with the model?
No. Contact bodies should always be used for contact involving large deformations.
Q22: Will CBEAM  pin flags rotate with the model?
No.
Q23: What is the difference between the Stress Tensor and the Nonlinear Stress Tensor quantities I see listed
in my Patran results?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;203 CHAPTER A

There is no difference. The label stress tensor  was used for linear analysis, and the label nonlinear stress
tensor  for nonlinear analysis.
Q24: Which stress quantity does MSC Nastran use when it looks up the stress/strain curve I provided?
For small strain elements (traditional MSC Nastran elements), engineering stress/strain is used, but
for large strain nonlinear element (new Marc elements), Cauchy stress is used.
Q25: Will the force I apply rotate with the model?
These are referred to as follower  forces  and they will be included if: 1) a nonlinear analysis procedure
is used; 2) a FORCE1  or FORCE2  entry is used for loading; and 3) and appropriate PARAM ,LGDISP&lt;br&gt;
value is used. Only follower  forces  applied by FORCE1 , FORCE2 , MOMENT1 , MOMENT2  will rotate
with model. Forces applied by RFORCE  will rotate according to the specified angular
velocity/acceleration rules.
Q26: What if I don&amp;rsquo;t want the force to rotate with the model?&lt;br&gt;
Use the static force FORCE  bulk data entry.
Q27: Will the pressure I apply to a surface rotate with the model?
Only follower  forces applied by PLOAD , PLOAD2 , and PLOAD4  will rotate with model.
For details, see follower  forces  notes under the PLOAD  and PLOAD4  entries in the  MSC Nastran Quick
Reference Guide .
Q28: Is it possible to create the input such that the pressure I apply to a surface will not rotate with the model?
Yes. With PLOAD4 , if the load direction is given, the pressure applied will be fixed in the given
direction and not rotate with model. See remark 2 of PLOAD4  in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference
Guide .
It says: The continuation entry is optional. If fields 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the continuation entry are
blank, the load is assumed to be a pressure acting normal to the face. If these fields are not blank, the
load acts in the direction defined in these fields. If CID is a curvilinear coordinate system, the
direction of loading may vary over the surface of the element. The load intensity is the load per unit
of surface area, not the load per unit of area normal to the direction of loading.
Q29: If I am familiar with running linear MSC Nastran analyses but have never run a nonlinear SOL 400
analysis, how can I learn what I need to do differently?
It is recommended that you run the example problems and make variations of these problems.
When learning a new MSC Nastran feature, engineers all too often generate a large problem using
several hundred or several thousand degrees of freedom as a test case. This practice has become the
norm in recent years with the advent of graphics preprocessors and automatic meshing.
Rarely is such a large model necessary to learn a new feature; in most cases, it just adds unnecessary
complexity. For this reason most of the examples in this book are small—generally less than 100
degrees of freedom.
To facilitate the use of these example problems, example problems referenced in this guide are
delivered with MSC Nastran system under the MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/linstat  with the extensions
of .dat . Copy an example problem to your local directory, so you can see the files created, and you
don&amp;rsquo;t inadvertently create files in the delivery directory.&lt;/p&gt;

Q30: How can I see a plot of load vs deflection for the rigid body that loaded my model?
Only available for load controlled rigid bodies, you can plot the results of the control grid of the
rigid body.
Q31: How can I monitor the nonlinear solution to see if it is progressing toward convergence?
Monitor the jobname.sts  file with a text editor that automatically updates. As each load
increment converges a new line with relevant information will appear in the .sts  file.
For details, see Chapter 6: Setting Up, Monitoring, and Debugging the Analysis .
Q32: Is it possible to see the results of any of the intermediate loading steps before the analysis is complete?
Yes. It is possible to have MSC Nastran write out the results of converged increments to intermediate
OP2 files. See the INTERM  option of the OUTCTRL  parameter under the NLOPRM  entry in the MSC
Nastran Quick Reference Guide .
Q33: How can I find out what the normal and frictional forces or stresses are between the contact bodies?
Use the BOUTPUT  case control output request and these values will be in the MASTER /DBALL  or new
OP2 files along with the other output requested.
Q34: Is an RBE spider the best way to fix a surface of my structure?
It depends on the constraints on the surface. If all the grids on the surface have the same behavior in
some direction, an RBE is easy to use. It is also easy to glue the area to a rigid surface and use the
rigid surface controls. You may also use SPC/SPC1 .
Q35: What are alternatives to an RBE spider for displacement control of part of my structure?
SPC/SPC1/SPCD/SPCR  may be combined together for any complicated displacement control.
Glueing  the area to a rigid surface and using the rigid surface controls is also easy.
Q36: Will I get the same answer if I apply my loads and constraints using a glued-on rigid surface as I would
using an RBE spider or displacement constraint?
Yes, if both loading methods are done correctly you will get the same results.
Q37: How do a simulate a complex sequence of loading, such as the process of an engine head going through
the sequence of bolt tightening, then heating up?
Break the loading up into discrete loadcases. For more information on this process, see Chapter 3:
Nonlinearity and Analysis Types  in this manual for more information on this topic.
Q38: What is the simplest way to include contact in my model?
If you create contact bodies and run a SOL 400 nonlinear analysis, the contact interaction is
included by default, but does not include friction between the components. Patran has a tool under
Tools  - Modeling  that automatically creates contact bodies based on groups, materials, properties,
etc.)
To include friction, specify the friction model and friction coefficients. You can specify a global
model value, a value for each contact body, or for each contact pair—the most localized value, in the
most general to most specific order just provided, will be used.

Linear vs. Non-linear12
Main Index
Linear vs. Non-linear
A linear static analysis  is an analysis where a linear relation holds between applied forces and displacements.
In practice, this is applicable to structural problems where stresses remain in the linear elastic range of the
used material. In this case, the response of the structure (deformation, stress  and strain) is linearly
proportional to the magnitude of the load (force, pressure, moment, torque.  temperature etc.). In short, linear
analysis does not consider any change in stiffness matrix.
Nonlinear  analysis occurs when the  load to response relationship is not linearly proportional. In a nonlinear
analysis, a nonlinear relation holds between applied forces and displacements. In case of nonlinear analysis
stiffness matrix change is considered.
All physical processes are inherently nonlinear to a certain extent. For example, when you stretch a rubber
band, it gets harder to pull as the deflection increases; or when you flex a paper clip, permanent deformation
is achieved. Several common every day applications like these exhibit either large deformations and/or
inelastic material behavior. Failure to account for nonlinear behavior can lead to product failures, safety issues,
and unnecessary cost to product manufacturers.
Nonlinear response could be caused by any of several characteristics of a system, like large deformations and
strains, material behavior or the effect of contact or other boundary condition nonlinearities. In reality many
structures exhibit combinations of these various nonlinearities. Hexagon p rovides solutions to help you
simulate accurately and efficiently systems with any or all of the nonlinearities, with applications
encompassing multiple industries.
Nonlinear Analysis: Basics
In many structures the deflections and the stresses do not change proportionately with the loads. In these
problems the structure’s response depends upon its current state and the equilibrium equations reflect the fact
that the stiffness of the structure is dependent on both u and P.
P = K (P, u ) u
As the structure displaces due to loading, the stiffness changes, and as the stiffness changes the structure’s
response changes. As a result, nonlinear problems require incremental solution schemes that divide the
problem up into steps calculating the displacement, then updating the stiffness. Each step uses the results
from the previous step as a starting point. As a result the stiffness matrix must be generated and inverted many
times during the analysis adding time and costs to the analysis.In addition, because the response is not
proportional to the loads, each load case must be solved separately and the principle of superposition is not
applicable.&lt;/p&gt;

Nonlinear Analysis
Main Index
When to Consider Nonlinear Analysis?
The following table lists different types of analysis, when you must consider them.
Causes of Nonlinearity
Nonlinear response can be caused by any of several characteristics of a structure:
Large deformations and strains. (Geometric Nonlinearity)
Material behavior (Material Nonlinearity)
The effect of contact (Contact Nonlinearity)
Boundary condition nonlinearities
In reality many structures exhibit combinations of these various nonlinearities. Most of the time either
material behavior is not linear in the operating  conditions, or geometry of the structure itself keeps it from
responding linearly.
Due to cost or  weight advantage of nonmetals (polymers, woods, composites etc.) over metals, nonmetals are&lt;br&gt;
replacing metals for variety of applications, which have nonlinear load to response characteristics,  even under
mild loading conditions. The structures are also optimized to make most of its  strength, pushing the load
level so close to the strength of the material, that it starts behaving  nonlinearly. In order to accurately predict
the strength of the structures in these circumstances, it is necessary to perform nonlinear analysis.Table 1-1  Different Analysis Types
Type of Analysis Explanation
Strength analysis How much load can the structure support before a global
failure occurs
Deflection analysis When deflection control is of primary importance
Stability analysis Finding critical points (limit points or bifurcation points)
closest to operational range
Service configuration analysis Finding the operational equilibrium form of ceratin slender
structures when the fabrication and service configurations are
different (e.g cables, inflatable structures and helicoids)
Reserve strength analysis Finding the load carrying capacity beyond critical points to
asses safety under abnormal conditions
Progressive failure analysis A variant of stability and strength analysis in which progressive
deterioration (e.g cracking) is considered.
Envelope analysis A combination of previous analyses in which multiple
parameters are varied and the strength information thus
obtained is condensed into failure envelopes.&lt;/p&gt;

Nonlinear Characteristics14
Main Index
Nonlinear Characteristics
Modeling for nonlinear analysis is not exempted from the guidelines for good modeling practice pertaining
to linear  analysis, which are summarized as follows:
The analyst should have some insight into the behavior of the structure to be modeled; otherwise, a
simple  model should be the starting point.
Substructuring should be considered for the modularity of the model and/or synergism between
projects and  agencies involved. The structure represented by a substructure is always linear.
The size of the model should be determined based on the purpose of the analysis, the trade-off
between  accuracy and efficiency, and the scheduled deadline.
Prior contemplation of the geometric modeling will increase efficiency in the long run. Factors to be&lt;br&gt;
considered include selection of coordinate systems, symmetric considerations for simplification, and&lt;br&gt;
systematic numbering of nodal points and elements for easy classification of locality.
Discretization should be based on the anticipated stress gradient, i.e., a finer mesh in the area of
stress concentrations.
Element types and the mesh size should be judiciously chosen. For example, avoid highly distorted
and/or  stretched elements (with high aspect ratio).
The model should be verified prior to the analysis by some visual means, such as plots and graphic
displays.
General Classification
Nonlinear problems of any type require iterative solution methods and incremental loading to obtain
(converge to) a solution, and are generally far more computationally difficult than linear problems. Nonlinear
problems are classified into the following three broad categories:
Geometric nonlinearity:  In the structures where stiffness is dependent on the displacement which
they may undergo are termed geometrically nonlinear. If a continuum body undergoes large finite
deformations, the strain-displacement relations become nonlinear. For structural mechanics
problems, under large deformations, the stiffness changes with deformation thus making the
problem nonlinear. (Buckling problems are also nonlinear).
Geometric nonlinearity accounts for phenomena such as:
•The stiffening of a loaded clamped plate,
•Buckling or snap-through behavior in slender structures or components.
Without taking these geometric effects into account, a computer simulation can fail to predict the
real structural behavior.
Material nonlinearity:  It refers to the ability for a material to exhibit a nonlinear stress-strain
(constitutive) response. This is one of the most common forms of nonlinearity. Material
nonlinearity is often, but not always, characterized by a gradual weakening of the structural response
as an increasing force is applied, due to some form of internal decomposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15 MSC Nastran: SOL 400 Getting Started Manual
Nonlinear Analysis
Main Index
Elasto-plastic, hyperelastic, crushing, and cracking are good examples, but this can also include
temperature and time-dependent effects such as visco-elasticity or visco-plasticity (creep). For
thermal problems, a temperature dependent thermal conductivity will produce nonlinear equations.
This is required to predict plastic strains in metallic parts, cracking or crushing of concrete, or
extreme deformation of plastic or rubber materials. It is nonlinear constitutive relation.
Boundary/Contacts nonlinearity:  When considering either highly flexible components, or
structural assemblies comprising multiple components, progressive displacement gives rise to the
possibility of either self or component-to-component contact. This characterizes to a specific class of
geometrically nonlinear effects known collectively as boundary condition  or contact  nonlinearity.
In boundary condition nonlinearity the stiffness of the structure or assembly may change
considerably when two or more parts either contact or separate from initial contact. Examples
include bolted connections, toothed gears, and different forms of sealing or closing mechanisms.
Problems involving contact mechanics normally include a boundary condition that depends on the
deformation thereby producing a nonlinear formulation. Thermal problems involving melting or
freezing (phase change) also include such nonlinear boundary conditions.
They are required to predict change in status and/or sliding friction between assembly parts. It is on-
constant displacement BCs.
General Recommendations
With these points in mind, additional recommendations are imperative for nonlinear analysis:
Identify the type of nonlinearity and localize the nonlinear region for computational efficiency. If
unsure,  perform a linear analysis to help understand the problem.
Segregate the linear region by using superelements and/or linear elements if possible. Notice that the&lt;br&gt;
potentially nonlinear elements can be used as linear elements.
The nonlinear region usually requires a finer mesh. Use a finer mesh if severe element distortions or
stress concentrations are anticipated.
The step/subcase structure should be utilized properly to divide the load or time history for
conveniences in  data recovery, and database storage control, not to mention changing constraints
and loading paths.
The load or time for the subcase with NLSTEP should then be further divided into increments, for
the purpose  of convergence control. Automatic adaptive load incrementation, such as is available via
NLSTEP, is the  recommended method.
Many options are available in solution methods to be specified on the NLSTEP data entries. The
defaults  should typically be used on all options to gain experience before experimenting with other
options.
Normal rotation for the drilling degree of freedom  of shell elements restrained by the default value of
100 on  the K6ROT parameter when the geometric nonlinearity is involved. In rare cases it may be
necessary to adjust  his value. This can help with convergence, but may also affect the results.
Understand the basic theory of plasticity, creep, or rubber elasticity before using these capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran: SOL 400 Getting Started Manual
Applications for Nonlinear Analysis16
Main Index
The time step size for a transient response analysis should be carefully considered based on the
highest natural  frequency of interest because it has significant effects on the efficiency as well as the
accuracy of the solution.  The automated procedures used by NLSTEP  is adequate for this purpose.
Applications for Nonlinear Analysis
Early development of nonlinear finite element technology was mostly influenced by the nuclear and
aerospace industries. In the nuclear industry, nonlinearity is mainly due to high-temperature behavior of
materials. Nonlinearity in the aerospace industry are mainly geometric in nature and range from simple linear
buckling to complicated post-bifurcation behavior. Nonlinear finite element techniques are now applied to
problems as diverse as automotive, biomechanics, civil, manufacturing, ship building, and many more.

Limitations of Nonlinear Analysis
For the analyst familiar with the use of LFEA, there are a number of consequences  of nonlinear behavior that
have to be recognized before embarking on a NFEA:
The principle of superposition cannot be applied
Results of several load cases cannot be scaled, factored and combined as is done  with LFEA
Only one load case can be handled at a time
The loading history (i.e. sequence of application of loads) are important
The structural response can be markedly non-proportional to the applied loading,  even for simple
loading states
Careful thought needs to be given to what is an appropriate measure of the behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17 MSC Nastran: SOL 400 Getting Started Manual
Nonlinear Analysis
Main Index
The initial state of stress (e.g. residual stresses from welding, temperature, or  prestressing of
reinforcement and cables) may be  extremely important for the overall response
Performing Nonlinear Static Analysis
For a typical nonlinear static analysis project, perform the following steps:
1.Build FE model : FE model building is very important step in FE analysis, irrespective of what  kind
of analysis to be performed. Selection of appropriate element for certain application need to be done
to care.The FEA group is provided with part surface data, which  is required to be meshed with
elements to get the component mesh.
When all the parts in the  assembly are meshed, they are al1 connected together using appropriate
fastening elements. In  genera l,Quad and Hex elements should be preferred over Tria, Penta and
Tetra. Important features  like fillets, holes, cutouts should be captured in the model appropriately.
If there are fasteners or  welds between two parallel surfaces, attempts should be made to create
similar mesh on both  surfaces, this will facilitate placement of weld or rigid elements normal to the
surfaces without  distorting the shell elements. However, many FEA codes support node
independent welds which  is based on tied contact concept, which allow the FEA user to place weld
elements independent  of the nodes in the parts to be welded.
It&amp;rsquo;s recommended to mesh the complex portion of a part  first then proceed towards the simple or
plane areas to ensure good quality mesh in the model.  Correct representation of fasteners, joints and
welds are necessary in the model for correct load  transfer within the structure.The stiffness and pre-
loading should be defined for these elements as applicable for better accuracy. If load transfer is
supposed to take place from one surface in  a structure to the other, a contact set should be defined
between them. Each FEA code has its  own format to input contact parameters. A typical contact
definition requires primary a nd secondary  nodes or elements, coefficient of friction, offset (gap)
distance between surfaces and contact  algorithm.
2.Assign material properties:  Material nonlinearity is defined in the FE model via this very  important
step. The response of the structure depends on the properties supplied to the FE  model.The software
manual should be referred to understand the input format of the material  data card. as different
software codes may have different format. If the software expects the  true stress-strain data then the
test stress-strain data should be converted into true data before feeding them to the FE model.
Sufficient stress-strain data points should be included to capture  the nonlinearity of the material.&lt;br&gt;
Analysts should request material suppliers to provide certified properties for the exact same  material
which is going to be used to build the partS.
3.Apply loads and boundary conditions:  No matter how good the FE mesh is, the results will  not be
accurate if the FE model is not constrained appropriately or if the load applied is not representative
of intended loading.The mesh size and node location sometimes puts constrains  on how and where
loads and boundary conditions are applied to the model, It would not hurt  to re-mesh the FE model
locally at the locations where to be applied to make sure loads and  boundary conditions are
represented best possible way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran: SOL 400 Getting Started Manual
Performing Nonlinear Static Analysis18
Main Index
If the FE analysis is being done to virtually validate any test done at lab, then it is a good practice  to
visit the testing facility and take important measurements on test fixtures and loading devices.  These
measurements will help apply loads and boundary conditions in FE model to in the same way as the
part or test specimen is subjected to at the time of testing. For example, measurements  of loading
device would help placing the loads on certain nodes or elements. Similarly the fixture dimensions
would dictate constraints locations (nodes) and its degrees of freedom.
4.Specify nonlinear analysis control parameters: The basic controlling parameters for nonlinear  static
analysis are initial increment, minimum and maximum increment, maximum numbers of  iterations,
the interval at which results file are to be output and convergence criteria for iterations  (acceptable
residual load).
5.Run the analysis:  The FE model is now ready to be run.The analysis run command may have  options
to specify solver version, memory size, and number of CPUs to better control execution.
6.Review and interpret results: It is highly recommended that the analysis results should be carefully
reviewed and checked for accuracy before making any conclusions based on simulations. There are
many ways the FEA results can be checked, some of them are:
•Observe for unexpected movements in the animation.
•Compare the reaction forces against applied forces.
•Check if stresses and strains are as per material properties supplied to the FE model
•Check interacting surfaces in the contact set for any malfunction
•Make quick hand calculations by simplifying the problem and compare it with the  FE results.
While reporting the FE results, you should always share all the assumptions made while building the FE
model. The FEA results should always be verified  using engineering judgment and past results with similar
FE model.
If there are unrealistically high or low results, you should review the model. It is recommended to maintain
consistency in the model to increase accuracy of the results, especially when analysis is being performed to
evaluate effect  of changing certain parameter in the model.&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction to SOL 400
SOL 400 is a set of application modules in the MSC Nastran system that pairs the full features of MSC
Nastran with  the nonlinear capabilities of the Marc solver to analyze a wide variety of structural problems
subjected to geometric  and material nonlinearity, and contact.&lt;br&gt;
In MSC Nastrans advanced integrated nonlinear solution (SOL 400), all the MSC Nastran infrastructure is
available. This is the recommended default solution for solving nonlinear problems. SOL 400 is a powerful,
easy to use tool for simulating manufacturing processes and component designs . An extensive finite element
library for building your simulation model, and a set of solution procedures for the nonlinear analysis, which
can handle very large matrix equations, are available in both solution sequences of MSC Nastran implicit
nonlinear.
In SOL 400  where the algorithms of Marc are embedded completely in MSC Nastran to form a
completely integrated MSC Nastran  solution. We recommend this as the default solution for
solving MSC Nastran nonlinear problems.
This is why MSC recommends that SOL 400 be the default solution method for solving nonlinear&lt;br&gt;
problems . An extensive finite element library for building your simulation model, and a set of
solution procedures for  the nonlinear analysis, which can handle very large matrix equations, are
available in both solution sequences of MSC  Nastran implicit nonlinear.&lt;/p&gt;

Model large displacement/rotation rigid elements
•Kinematic RBEi elements
Capabilities of SOL400
It is an advanced nonlinear solution process that combines capabilities of multiple solution sequences and
software components into a common solution.
SOL 400 solves linear and nonlinear (material, contact and/or geometric) static, heat transfer,
modal (vibration), buckling, and transient dynamic structural finite element problems.
Eigenvalue solutions are available in SOL 400 for solving linear or nonlinear modal analyses and
linear buckling analysis using either Lanczos or inverse power sweep methods of iteration. Through
the use of parameters you can control the convergence of the eigenvalues, and the modes to retain.
Forces can be applied to nodes in any coordinate system.
Constrained nodal displacements (zero displacements at specified DOF). Enforced nodal
displacements (nonzero displacements at specified DOF in the nodal coordinate system). Both

Converting Nastran Linear to Nastran Nonlinear
Converting from Nastran linear to Nastran Nonlinear solutions 400 require less effort in modifying than
recreating the model from scratch. Most of the additional effort goes in preparing the model for the challenges
of a nonlinear solution. These challenges include:
Making sure the system is well conditioned (model is fully constrained, no autospc!, not force
balance only!)
Ensuring that the model behaves as desired due to nonlinear effects. Plasticity, large displacement
and contact must be defined and checked carefully even for a converged solution.
Defining the proper (efficiency but accurate) parameters for a nonlinear solution (e.g. convergence
criteria)&lt;/p&gt;

Analysis Types
A large class of stress analysis problems can be solved with SOL 400. A fundamental division of stress
problems is whether a static, transient dynamics, or perturbation analysis is to be performed. In a dynamic
response, the inertia effects are important. SOL 400 allows complete flexibility in making this distinction, so
that the same analysis may contain several static, dynamic, and pertubation phases.
An important aspect of the flexibility is the manner in which MSC Nastran SOL 400 allows you to step
through the loading history to be analyzed. This is accomplished by defining the job steps for the analysis.
A basic concept in MSC Nastran SOL 400 is the division of the problem history into job steps. A clear
distinction is made in MSC Nastran SOL 400 between linear analysis and nonlinear analysis procedures.
Loading conditions are defined differently for the two cases, time measures are different, and the results
should be interpreted differently. A step is any convenient phase of the history – a thermal transient, a creep
period, a dynamic transient, etc. In its simplest form, a step is just a static analysis of a load change from one
magnitude to another.
An analysis step during which the response may be nonlinear is called a general analysis step. An analysis step
during which the response may only be linear is called a linear perturbation analysis step. Since MSC Nastran
SOL 400 treats such linear analysis as a linear perturbation about a preloaded, predeformed state, its
capability for doing linear analysis is rather more general than that of a purely linear analysis program.
Analysis types  for steps/subcases in SOL 400 include the following:
Type Description
Linear Static Static stress analysis is used when inertia effects can be neglected. During a linear
static step, the model’s response is defined by the linear elastic stiffness at the base
state, the state of deformation and stress at the beginning of the step.
Nonlinear Static Nonlinear static analysis requires the solution of nonlinear equilibrium equations,
for which SOL 400 uses Newton’s method. Many problems involve history
dependent response, so that the solution is usually obtained as a series of
increments, with iteration within each increment to obtain equilibrium. For most
cases, the automatic incrementation provided by SOL 400 is preferred, although
direct user control is also provided for those cases where you have experience with
a particular problem. This includes creep, viscoelastic and body approach
Normal Modes This solution type uses eigenvalue techniques to extract the frequencies of the
current system,
Modal T ransient
DynamicThe Duhamel Integral method integrates all of the equations of motion through
time. The accuracy is based upon the number of modes extracted.
Nonlinear
T ransient DynamicThis solution type is used when nonlinear dynamic response is being studied. For
most cases, the automatic incrementation provided is preferred, although direct
user control is also provided for those cases where you have experience with a
particular problem. The Generalized-alpha method has been presented as an
unconditionally stable (for linear systems), second-order algorithm that allows
user-controllable numerical dissipation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran: SOL 400 Getting Started Manual
Analysis Types28
Main Index
A complete description of the available analysis types is provided in Chapter 3: Nonlinearity and Analysis
Types .
In each step, choose the solution type. This defines the type of analysis to be performed during the step:
dynamic stress analysis, eigenvalue buckling, transient heat transfer analysis, etc. The procedure choice may
be changed from step to step in any meaningful way, so that you have great flexibility in performing analyses.
Since the state of the model (stresses, strains, temperatures, etc.) is updated throughout all nonlinear analysis
steps, the effects of previous history are always included in the response in each new step. Thus, for example,
if natural frequency extraction is performed after a geometrically nonlinear static analysis step, the preload
stiffness will be included. Superposition cannot be applied in nonlinear problems. In general, a different
loading sequence (reordering of the steps) requires a complete new analysis.
In a nonlinear static analysis, you first determine the total value of loading to be applied at a particular stage
of the analysis. This loading value is selected with the LOAD  case control command specifying a load set ID
that exists in the bulk data. In this case, the step functions as a type of landmark in the loading history. It may
be an expected point or a point at which the nature of the loading changes (for example, first applying an
internal pressure loading and then an axial loading on a cylinder). The steps is a major partition of the loading Direct Frequency
ResponseFrequency response analysis is a method used to compute structural response to
steady-state oscillatory (such as rotating machinery) excitation. In frequency
response analysis the excitation is explicitly defined in the frequency domain. The
direct method solves the coupled equations of motion in terms of forcing
frequency
Modal Frequency
ResponseThe modal method utilizes the mode shapes of the structure to reduce and
uncouple the equations of motion. The solution for a particular forcing frequency
is obtained through the summation of the individual modal responses.
Direct Complex
EigenvalueComplex eigenvalue analysis is used to compute the damped modes of structures
and assess the stability of systems modeled with transfer functions. Direct
Complex eigenvalue analysis solves the coupled equations of motion.
Modal Complex
EigenvalueThe modal method utilizes the mode shapes of the structure to reduce and

Steady State Heat
T ransferThis solution type is for heat transfer problems where the  temperature field can be
found for the current contact and deformation states of the bodies being studied.
(e.g., it is assumed that there are no changes in the structure during the heat
transfer analysis). For cases where there are mechanical changes in the structure a
coupled thermal-structural solution must be performed.
T ransient Heat
T ransferThis solution type is for transient heat transfer problems  where the temperature
field can be found based on the current state of stress and deformation of the
bodies being studied (e.g., it is assumed that there are no changes in the structure
during the heat transfer analysis). For cases where there are mechanical changes in
the structure a coupled thermal-structural solution must be performed. For all
transient heat transfer cases, the time increments may be specified directly, or will
be selected automatically based on a user prescribed maximum nodal temperature
change in a step. Automatic time incrementation is generally recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

history. The loading history should be divided into subcases since this provides you with more control over
the solution and restart strategy.
Analysis Procedures
This section describes the practical steps involved in setting up and running MSC Nastran SOL 400 jobs,
including the use of Patran. The Patran UI is set up to guide you through the process of setting up the SOL
400 analysis, including
The job information for the executive section (select the solution type and solution parameters),
The subcases and steps (create subcases and steps and use subcase parameters to specify the required
step/subcase control information)
The job submission (use Analyse &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; Entire Model -&amp;gt; Full Run )
Monitoring the job while it is running and once it is done (user Monitor -&amp;gt;  Job -&amp;gt; View sts  to
monitor and Monitor -&amp;gt; Job -&amp;gt; View f06  to debug).
It covers the Patran user interface (UI) and its capabilities for setting up, submitting, and monitoring the job.
It shows the user how to specify the analysis type, but does not go into any detail about the analysis types of
the individual steps being set up.  See Nonlinearity and Analysis Types  for the details of analysis types.
The STEP  is the SOL 400 mechanism for associating loads and boundary conditions, output requests, and
various other parameters to be used during part of a complete run. Each step can be designated with one of
the analysis types listed below. For each Analysis Type,  define the Solution Parameters  and Output
Requests ; these collectively constitute the Analysis Procedures .
In MSC Nastran, case control commands provide the loads and constraints, and load incrementation
method, and controls the program after the initial elastic analysis. Case control commands also include
blocks which allow changes in the initial model specifications. Case control commands can also specify print-
out and postprocessing options.
Each set of load sets must begin with a SUBCASE/STEP  command and be terminated by another
SUBCASE/STEP  or a BEGIN BULK  command. If there is only one load case, the SUBCASE/STEP  entry is
not required. The SUBCASE  option requests that the program perform another increment or series of
increments. The input format for these options is described in MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide .

In SOL 400, all SUBCASEs are independent from each other. Sub-cases are independent, multidiscipline
load cases. Like SOL 101, many independent subcases can be performed in one single run . Each STEP can
be performed with another type of analysis, i.e. statics, transient, normal modes, and frequency response, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

Nonlinear Analysis32
Main Index
Nonlinear Analysis
However, we know that in many structures the deflections and the stresses do not change proportionately
with the loads. In these problems the structure’s response depends upon its current state and the equilibrium
equations reflect the fact that the stiffness of the structure is dependent on both u and P.
P = K  (P, u ) u
As the structure displaces due to loading, the stiffness changes, and as the stiffness changes the structure’s
response changes. As a result, nonlinear problems require incremental solution schemes that divide the
problem up into steps calculating the displacement, then updating the stiffness. Each step uses the results
from the previous step as a starting point. As a result the stiffness matrix must be generated and inverted many
times during the analysis adding time and costs to the analysis.In addition, because the response is not
proportional to the loads, each load case must be solved separately and the principle of superposition is not
applicable.
Applications for Nonlinear Analysis
Early development of nonlinear finite element technology was mostly influenced by the nuclear and
aerospace industries. In the nuclear industry, nonlinearity is mainly due to high-temperature behavior of
materials. Nonlinearity in the aerospace industry are mainly geometric in nature and range from simple linear
buckling to complicated post-bifurcation behavior. Nonlinear finite element techniques are now applied to
problems as diverse as automotive, biomechanics, civil, manufacturing, ship building, and many more. MSC
Nastran SOL 700 may be used for solving high speed events such as crash and explosions.
Static Analysis
Static stress analysis is used when inertia effects can be neglected. The problem may still have a real time scale,
for example when the material has a viscoplastic response, such as rate dependent yield. The analysis may be
linear or nonlinear. Nonlinearity may arise from large displacement effects, material nonlinearity and
boundary nonlinearity (such as contact and friction).
Linear static analysis involves the specification of load cases and appropriate boundary conditions. Solutions
may be combined in a postprocessing mode.
Nonlinear static analysis requires the solution of nonlinear equilibrium equations, for which the program uses
Full Newton-Raphson or Modified Newton-Raphson. Many problems involve history dependent response,
so that the solution is usually obtained as a series of increments, with iteration within each increment to
obtain equilibrium. Increments must sometimes be kept small (in the sense that rotation and strain
increments must be small) to assure correct modeling of history dependent effects, but most commonly the
choice of increment size is a matter of computational efficiency – if the increments are too large, more
iteration will be required. Each solution method has a finite radius of convergence, which means that too
large an increment can prevent any solution from being obtained because the initial state is too far away from
the equilibrium state that is being sought – it is outside the radius of convergence. Thus, there is an
algorithmic restriction on the increment size. For most cases, the automatic incrementation scheme is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;33 CHAPTER 3
Capabilities

preferred, because it will select increment sizes based on these considerations. Direct user control of
increment size is also provided because there are cases when you have considerable experience with his
particular problem and can therefore select a more economic approach. A complete discussion of the
numerical methods used to solver nonlinear static problems is included in this chapter; to get a converged
solution, see Chapter 6: Setting Up, Monitoring, and Debugging the Analysis .
Geometrically nonlinear static problems frequently involve buckling or collapse behavior, where the load-
displacement response shows a negative stiffness, and the structure must release strain energy to remain in
equilibrium. Several approaches are possible in such cases. One is to treat the buckling response dynamically,
thus actually modeling the kinetic response with inertia effects included as the structure snaps. This is easily
accomplished by using the restart option to terminate the static procedure and switch to a dynamic procedure
when the static solution goes unstable. In some simple cases, displacement control can provide a solution,
even when the conjugate load (the reaction force) is decreasing as the displacement increases. More generally,
static equilibrium states during the unstable phase of the response can be found by using the modified Riks
method. This method is for cases where the loading is proportional – that is, where the load magnitudes are
governed by a single scalar parameter. The method obtains equilibrium solutions by controlling the path
length along the load-displacement curve within each increment (rather than controlling the load or
displacement increment), so that the load magnitude becomes an unknown of the system. The method can
provide solutions even in cases of complex, unstable response. The Riks method cannot be used in contact,
heat transfer, coupled, or enforced motion.
Linear Analysis
In a linear analysis, we implicitly assume that the deflections and strains are very small and the stresses are
smaller than the material yield stresses. Consequently, there is assumed to be a linear relationship between
the applied loads and the response of the structure. The stiffness can be considered to remain constant (i.e.,
independent of the displacements and forces) and the finite element equilibrium equations
P = Ku
are linear where the stiffness matrix K is independent of both u, the generalized displacement vector, and P,
the generalized force vector. This linearity implies that any increase or decrease in the load will produce
proportional increase or decrease in displacements, strains, and stresses. Because of the linear relationship,
you only need to calculate the stiffness of the structure once. From this stiffness representation, you can find
the structure’s response to other applied loads by multiplying the load vectors by the decomposed stiffness
matrix. Linear static problems are solved in a single step. In addition, solutions can be combined using the
principle of superposition.
A linear analysis is the simplest and most cost effective type of analysis to perform. Because linear analysis is
simple and inexpensive to perform and often gives satisfactory results, it is the most commonly used
structural analysis. Nonlinearities due to material, geometry, or boundary conditions are not included in this
type of analysis. The behavior of an isotropic, linear, elastic material can be defined by two material constants:
Young’s modulus, and Poisson’s ratio.
In actuality, linear analysis is merely an approximation to the true behavior of a structure. In some cases the
approximation is very close to the true behavior, in other cases linear analysis may provide highly inaccurate
results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran: SOL 400 Getting Started Manual
Linear Analysis34
Main Index
Linear analysis is obtained by considering the response in the step as the linear perturbation response about
the base state. The base state is the current state of the model at the end of the last general, nonlinear analysis
step prior to the linear perturbation step. Thus, the concept of linear analysis in MSC Nastran SOL 400 is
rather general. A simple example of the value of this generalization is the natural frequencies of a violin string
under increasing tension. In this case, geometrically nonlinear analysis of the string can be done in several
steps, in each of which the tension is increased. At the end of each such step, the frequencies can be extracted
in a linear perturbation analysis step.
Load magnitudes (including the magnitudes of prescribed boundary conditions), during a linear perturbation
analysis step, are defined as the magnitudes of the load perturbations only.
Likewise, the value of any solution variable is output as the perturbation value only – the value of the variable
in the base state is not included.
During a linear perturbation analysis step, the model’s response is defined by its linear elastic stiffness at the
base state. Plasticity and other inelastic effects are ignored. For hyperelastic materials, the tangent elastic
moduli in the base state are used. Contact conditions cannot change during a perturbation analysis – they
remain as they are defined in the base state. Frictional slipping is not allowed during perturbation analyses –
all points in contact are assumed to be sticking if friction is present. If geometric nonlinearity is included in
the general, nonlinear analysis upon which the linear perturbation study is being based, stress stiffening or
softening effects and (pressure and other follower force) load stiffness effects are included in the linear
perturbation analysis. In this case, perturbation stresses and strains are defined relative to the base state
configuration. The effects of temperature and field variable perturbations are ignored for materials that are
dependent on temperature and field variables. However, temperature perturbations will produce
perturbations of thermal strain.
Some procedures are purely linear perturbation procedures. These are:
Linear Statics: ANALYSIS = STATICS
Bifurcation Buckling: ANALYSIS = BUCK
Natural Frequency: ANALYSIS = MODES
Modal Linear Transient: ANALYSIS = MTRAN
Modal Complex Eigenvalue: ANALYSIS = MCEIG
Modal linear transient analysis and linear static analysis are done in the time domain. The step time of linear
perturbations is never accumulated into the total time. For linear static perturbations the step time always
begins at zero for each new step.
Linear Perturbation Analysis
Linear perturbation analysis may be performed from time to time during a fully nonlinear analysis. This is
done by continuing the nonlinear response steps between the linear perturbation steps. The linear
perturbation response has no effect as the nonlinear analysis is continued. Generally, dynamic analyses may
not be interrupted to perform perturbation analyses: before performing the perturbation analysis, MSC
Nastran SOL 400 requires that the structure be brought into static equilibrium.
In SOL 400, the ANALYSIS  case control command may be used to define a linear perturbation analysis STEP .
Pertubation analysis implies a linearized solution about a nonlinear, preloaded state. The preloaded state may&lt;/p&gt;

be either a nonlinear static, nonlinear transient analysis, or a thermo-mechanically coupled analysis. When
performing a perturbation analysis in SOL 400 with large displacement activated:
The preload will be performed including large displacements and other material nonlinearities.
The stress obtained will be included in the initial stress stiffness of the perturbation step.
Linear Static
Static stress analysis is used when inertia effects can be neglected. The problem may still have a real time scale,
for example when the material has a viscoplastic response, such as rate dependent yield. The analysis may be
linear or nonlinear.
In linear static analysis, ANALYSIS = STATICS
Linear static analysis involves the specification of load cases and appropriate boundary conditions.
Traditionally, linear static analysis is performed using SOL 101.
Normal Modes
This solution type uses eigenvalue techniques to extract the frequencies of the current system. The stiffness
determined at the end of the previous step is used as the basis for the extraction, so that small vibrations of a
preloaded structure or nonlinearly deformed structure can be modeled.
Direct and Modal Linear Transient Dynamics
Depending upon the structure and the nature of the loading, two different numerical methods can be used
for a transient response analysis: direct and modal.
The direct method ( DTRAN ): It performs a numerical integration on the complete coupled
equations of motion.
ANALYSIS = DTRAN
The modal method (MTRAN): It utilizes the mode shapes of the structure to reduce and uncouple
the equations of motion (when modal or no damping is used); the solution is then obtained through
the summation of the individual modal responses.
ANALYSIS = MTRAN
It is used when the transient dynamic response of a linear system, which includes inertial effects, is
being studied. Since the use of modal transient analysis is covered completely in the MSC Nastran
Dynamic Analysis User’s Guide , it will not be covered in this manual.
Direct and Modal Frequency Response
Frequency response analysis is a method used to compute structural response to steady-state oscillatory
excitation. Examples of oscillatory excitation include rotating machinery, unbalanced tires, and helicopter
blades. In frequency response analysis the excitation is explicitly defined in the frequency domain. All of the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran: SOL 400 Getting Started Manual
General Nonlinear Analysis36
Main Index
applied forces are known at each forcing frequency. Forces can be in the form of applied forces and/or
enforced motions (displacements, velocities, or accelerations).
T wo different numerical methods can be used in frequency response analysis.
The direct method ( ANALYSIS = DFREQ)  solves the coupled equations of motion in terms of
forcing frequency.
The modal method ( ANALYSIS = MFREQ ) utilizes the mode shapes of the structure to reduce and
uncouple the equations of motion.
Direct and Modal Complex Eigenvalue
Complex eigenvalue analysis is used to compute the damped modes of structures and assess the stability of
systems modeled with transfer functions (including servomechanisms and rotating systems).
ANALYSIS = DCEIG, MCEIG
Complex eigenvalue analysis solves for the eigenvalues and mode shapes similar to normal modes analysis
except that damping is added and the eigenvalue is now complex. In addition, the mass, damping, and
stiffness matrices may be unsymmetric, and they may contain complex coefficients.
General Nonlinear Analysis
A general analysis step is one in which nonlinear effects are included (although this is not necessary – it is
possible to define a problem using general analysis procedures so that the response is entirely linear). The
starting condition for each general step is generally the ending condition from the last general step, with the
state of the model evolving throughout the history of general, nonlinear analysis steps as it responds to the
history of loading.
In a general, nonlinear analysis step the loads must be defined as total values. MSC Nastran SOL 400 always
considers total time to increase throughout the general, nonlinear analysis. Each step also has its own step
time, which begins at zero in each step. If the analysis procedure for the step has a physical time scale, as in a
dynamic analysis, step time corresponds to that physical time. Otherwise, step time is any convenient time
scale, typically 0.0-1.0, for the step. The step times of all general nonlinear analysis steps accumulate into total
time.
Nonlinear Static
Nonlinearity may arise from large displacement effects, material nonlinearity and boundary nonlinearity
(such as contact and friction).
ANALYSIS = NLSTATICS
This behavior requires the solution by a series of increments, with iteration within each increment to obtain
equilibrium. For most cases, the automatic incrementation provided by SOL 400 is preferred, although direct
user control is also provided for those cases where you have experience with a particular problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;37 CHAPTER 3
Capabilities
Main Index
For static analysis, which involves post buckling behavior, where the load-displacement response shows a
negative stiffness, and the structure must release strain energy to remain in equilibrium, an automatic load
incrementation procedure must be used.
For local buckling, a quasi-static damping procedure via the ADAPT  option on the NLSTEP  bulk data entry
may be used. However, this option only works in conjunction with advanced nonlinear elements. For global
buckling, an arc length based procedure via the ARCLN  option on the NLSTEP  bulk date entry may be used.
This option only works for non-contact scenarios.
Nonlinear Transient Dynamic
This solution type is used when the transient dynamic response, which includes inertial effects, is being
studied. When nonlinear behaviors are included in the problem, the direct integration method, ANALYSIS
= NLTRAN , must be used.
For most cases, the automatic load incrementation method provided by NLSTEP  is preferred, although direct
user control is also provided for those cases where you have experience with a particular problem. For linear
transient dynamic analysis, the MTRAN  perturbation method should be used.
Creep
This analysis procedure performs a transient, static, stress/displacement analysis.
ANALYSIS = NLSTATICS
It is especially provided for the analysis of materials which are described by the MATVP  material form. The
time integration method is controlled by (and described under) the NLSTEP  bulk data entry.
Viscoelastic
This is especially provided for the time domain analysis of materials which are described by the MATVE&lt;br&gt;
material options.
ANALYSIS = NLSTATICS
The dissipative part of the material behavior is defined through a Prony series representation of the
normalized shear and bulk relaxation moduli. The time integration method is controlled the same as a creep
analysis using (and described under) the NLSTEP  bulk data entry.
Heat Transfer Procedures
Heat transfer problems including conduction, forced convection, and boundary radiation and convection
can be solved with MSC Nastran SOL 400.
ANALYSIS = HSTAT or HTRAN
The problems can be transient or steady-state, linear or nonlinear. The heat transfer elements allow for heat
storage (specific heat) and heat conduction, and also allow for forced convection caused by fluid flowing
through the mesh. Heat interface elements are also provided, to model the heat transfer across the boundary&lt;/p&gt;

layer between a solid and a fluid, or between two closely adjacent solids. Shell-type heat transfer elements are
included, since so many structures are of this type. The second order elements usually give more accurate
results for the same number of nodes in the mesh. Analyses that involve both thermal and mechanical
solutions are referred to in SOL 400 as multi-physics solutions.
Nonlinear Transient Response Analysis
Nonlinear analysis requires iterative solution methods, thereby making it far more computationally intensive
than a corresponding linear analysis. Nonlinear transient response analysis is available in MSC Nastran in
SOL 129 and 400, ANALYSIS = NLTRAN . Nonlinear problems are classified into three broad categories:
geometric nonlinearity, material nonlinearity, and contact.
The primary solution operations are load and time steps, iterations with convergence tests for acceptable
equilibrium error, and stiffness matrix updates. The iterative process is based on the Newton-Raphson
method. The tangent matrix updates are performed automatically to improve the computational efficiency,
and may be overridden at your discretion.
The adaptive method is implemented using the two -point recurrence (or one-step) formula as its foundation.
The optimum time step size, which is required for accuracy and efficiency, changes continuously in the
transient dynamic environment. The primary concept of automatic time step adjustment is that the proper
size of the time step can be predicted based on the dominant frequency in the incremental deformation
pattern at the previous time step. This concept presents a deficiency of time lag involved in the prediction
process. Furthermore, changes in nonlinearity cannot be predicted from the deformation pattern at the
previous time step.
Nonlinear Transient Response Analysis Interface
User Interface
The nonlinear properties and/or effects are defined by nonlinear material data ( MATS1 , MATEP , and
TABLES1 ), and PARAM ,LGDISP  for geometric nonlinearity. The transient effects are produced by
time-dependent loading functions ( TLOADi , DAREA , etc.), damping (parameters, elements and material data),
and mass properties.
The unique data required for SOL 400 is supplied on the NLSTEP ,  an all-encompassing time/load
incrementation control entry for nonlinear analysis. See Chapter 4: Solution Strategies for Nonlinear
Analysis : NLSTEP Bulk Data Entry  for a detailed description of the NLSTEP  entry and using it for nonlinear
static and transient analyses.
Case Control
Each subcase and step defines a time interval starting from the last time step of the previous subcase or
subcase, subdivided into smaller time steps using the NLSTEP  entry. The output time is labeled by the
cumulative time, including all previous subcases. The data blocks containing solutions are generated at the
end of each subcase for storage in the database for output processing and restarts. As such, converged
solutions are apt to be saved at many intermediate steps in case of divergence and more flexible control&lt;/p&gt;

becomes possible with multiple subcases. Results from converged increments can be output to *.op2  files
using the NLOPRM  case control entry.
The input loading functions may be changed for each subcase or continued by repeating the same DLOAD&lt;br&gt;
request. However, it is recommended that one use the same TLOAD  bulk data for all the subcases in order to
maintain the continuity between subcases, because TLOADi  data defines the loading history as a function of
cumulative time. Static loads ( PLOADi, FORCEi, MOMENTi ) may be associated with time -dependent functions
by matching the EXCITEID  on the TLOADi  entries. Nonlinear forces as functions of displacements or
velocities ( NOLINi ) may be selected and printed by the case control commands NONLINEAR  and NLLOAD ,
respectively. Each subcase may have a different time step size, time interval, and iteration control selected by
the NLSTEP  request. Case control requests that may not be changed after the first subcase are SPC, MPC,
DMIG,  and TF.
Output requests for each subcase are processed independently. Requested output quantities for all the
subcases are appended after the computational process for actual output operation. See Chapter 8 for a
discussion on output requests and see the MSC Nastran  Quick Reference Guide  for a complete list of output
requests.&lt;br&gt;
Initial conditions (displacement or velocity) can be specified by the bulk data input, TIC, selectable by the
case control command IC. If initial conditions are given, all of the nonlinear element forces and stresses must
be computed to satisfy equilibrium with the prescribed initial displacements. On the other hand, initial
conditions can be generated by applying static analysis for the preload using PARAM,TSTATIC  in the first
subcase. Then the transient analysis can be performed in the ensuing subcases. Associated with the adaptive
time stepping method, the PARAM,NDAMP  is used to control the stability in the ADAPT  method. The NDAMP&lt;br&gt;
parameter represents the numerical damping (a recommended value for usual cases is 0.01), which is often
required to improve the stability and convergence in contact problems.
Time Step Definition
In a transient dynamic analysis, time step parameters are required for integration in time. These parameters
are specified in SOL 400 through the NLSTEP  entry. These can be used for the Newmark beta operator to
invoke the adaptive time control. Enter parameters to specify the time step size and period of time for this
set of boundary conditions.
When using the Newmark-beta operator, decide which frequencies are important to the response. The time
step in this method should not exceed 10 percent of the period of the highest relevant frequency in the
structure. Otherwise, large phase errors will occur. The phenomenon usually associated with too large a time
step is strong oscillatory accelerations. With even larger time steps, the velocities start oscillating. With still
larger steps, the displacement eventually oscillates. In nonlinear problems, numerical instability usually
follows oscillation. When using adaptive dynamics, you should prescribe a maximum time step.
As in the Newmark-beta operator, the time step in Houbolt integration should not exceed 10 percent of the
period of the highest frequency of interest. However, the Houbolt method not only causes phase errors, it
also causes strong artificial damping. Therefore, high frequencies are damped out quickly and no obvious
oscillations occur. It is, therefore, completely up to the engineer to determine whether the time step was
adequate. The damping problem is alleviated to a large extent with the Single Step Houbolt operator.&lt;/p&gt;

Coupled Thermal-Mechanical40
Main Index
In nonlinear problems, the mode shapes and frequencies are strong functions of time because of large
displacement effects, so that the above guidelines can be only a coarse approximation. To obtain a more
accurate estimate, repeat the analysis with a significantly different time step (1/5 to 1/10 of the original) and
compare responses.
Coupled Thermal-Mechanical
T raditionally, structural simulations and thermal simulations have been performed independently of one&lt;br&gt;
another in separate analysis codes specialized in solving each physical discipline. In large companies  there are
different structural and thermal specialists and departments. These groups interact with each  other as the
thermal analysts provide the structural analysts with temperature data for thermal distortion  and thermal
stress analysis. For sophisticated systems, the thermal analysis is dependent on the structural  deflection, so an
iterative loop is set up to capture all the effects properly.  MSC Nastran has had nonlinear structural and heat
transfer capabilities since its inception.
One of the keys to multi-physics simulations is to capture the structural and thermal load path changes  caused
by contact. MD Nastran has had structural contact capabilities since its inception. General  structural contact
allows mechanical meshes to come in to contact and change the load path. Glued  structural contact will weld
mechanical meshes together. Thermal contact is a similar concept but for thermal analysis rather than
structural analysis. In addition, the multi-physics aspect of MSC Nastran allows for coupling thermal and&lt;br&gt;
mechanical contact in the same run. In thermal analysis, thermal contact is available for both steady state  and
transient.
For coupled thermal-mechanical analysis the mechanical analysis can be static or dynamic and the  thermal
analysis can be steady state or transient. This allows four combinations of coupled thermo mechanical&lt;br&gt;
analysis:
HSTAT-NLSTAT
HSTAT-NLTRAN
HTRAN-NLSTAT
HTRAN-NLTRAN,
where HSTAT, HTRAN, NLSTAT , and NLTRAN  stand for steady state heat transfer, transient heat  transfer,
structural nonlinear statics, and structural nonlinear transient respectively.
The coupled analysis  can account for plasticity and frictional heat coupling and proper updating of interface
conditions when  there is relative motion between bodies.  The bi-directional coupling is a weakly coupled
approach between thermal and mechanical passes. The  available bi-directional coupling schemes are
identified in the figure below and they allow simulation of  thermo-mechanical effects associated with large
deformation problems and frictional contact.
Thermal Contact
As described in the multi-physics introduction, one of the keys to multi-physics simulations is to capture  the
structural and thermal load path changes caused by contact. MSC Nastran has had structural contact&lt;br&gt;
capabilities since its inception. General structural contact allows mechanical meshes to come in to  contact
and change the load path. Glued structural contact will weld mechanical meshes together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;41 CHAPTER 3
Capabilities
Main Index
Thermal contact is a similar concept but for thermal analysis rather than structural analysis.  You will be able
to analyze thermal interactions between different  contact bodies for the body areas that are in contact and
thermal interactions between contact bodies and  the environment for the body areas that are not in contact.
In addition to contact  and no contact from  the pure mechanical case, there is near contact  which allows thermal
interactions between bodies that  are getting near to each other, but not yet in real (mechanical) contact.
Thermal contact is available for  both steady state and transient analysis.
Benefits
This functionality provides a user-friendly interface to defining thermal contact conditions. The user  defines
contact bodies with their thermal properties and contact tables defining the possible contact  pairings with
the thermal properties for each pairing. The program automatically identifies the body  areas involved in
contact and the body areas exposed to the environment and for each situation, it sets  up the appropriate
interface conditions for the thermal interactions.
In a coupled thermal-mechanical analysis, bodies may have relative motions, causing the contact  conditions
to change over time. Due to friction forces in the contact interface, heat may be generated  adding an extra
heat flux load in the thermal phase of the analysis. All changes in the interface conditions  and resulting loads
are updated automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

SOL 400 Input File
To perform an analysis using MSC Nastran, you must generate an input file describing the structure’s
geometry,  material properties, boundary conditions, and loads. In addition to defining the physical structure,
the input file also  specifies the type of analysis to be performed and other pertinent information. The input
file is an ASCII text file which  can be created using any text editor or one of the many preprocessors that
interface with MSC Nastran.
After the generation of the input file is complete, it is submitted for execution as a batch process. Once the
input file  has been submitted, you have no additional interaction with MSC Nastran until the job is
complete.
The MSC Nastran Input File, often referred to as the Bulk Data File ( .bdf ), (or .dat in the MSC Nastran
manuals),  is made up of three distinct sections:
Executive Control: It describes the problem or solution type and optional file management.
Case Control: It defines the load history and output requests.
Bulk Data: It defines a detailed model, load and constraint description.
For details, refer to the MSC Nastran Getting Started Guide  or the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide.

Running Existing Nonlinear Models in SOL 400
Some users may have existing models that have been developed and analyzed using MSC Nastran Nonlinear
Solution Sequences 106 or 129 (or others). These models may be run through SOL 400 by changing the
SOLUTION  procedure input to SOL 400 with the proper Analysis , such as NLSTATIC  or NLTRAN , case
control command in each SUBCASE /STEP  as described in the following chapters. It is advantageous to read
the model into Patran and change the Solution Type  on the Analysis  menu. In this case, Patran then modifies
the input it writes to match that required by the specific SOL 400 solution sequence being written out. This
method is especially useful to activate advanced nonlinear capabilities.
Generating and Editing the Bulk Data File in Patran
Patran offers a MSC Nastran interface that provides a communication link between Patran and MSC
Nastran. The interface is a fully integrated part of the Patran system.
Generating the BDF
Selecting MSC Nastran as the analysis code preference in Patran, activates the customization process. These
customizations ensure that sufficient and appropriate data is generated for the MSC Nastran interface.
Specifically, the Patran forms in these main areas are modified:
Materials
Element Properties
Finite Elements/MPCs and Meshing
Loads and Boundary ConditionsBulk Data Section&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;45 CHAPTER 4
SOL 400 Files
Main Index
Analysis Forms
Using Patran, you can run a MSC Nastran analysis or you may generate the MSC Nastran Input File to run
externally. For information on generating the MSC Nastran Input file from within Patran, see Chapter 3:
Running an Analysis, Analysis Form  in the Patran Interface to MSC Nastran Preference Guide .
Editing the BDF
Once the bulk data file has been generated, you can edit the file directly from Patran.
1.Click the Analysis Application  button to bring up Analysis Application  form.
2.On the Analysis  form, set the Action &amp;gt; Object &amp;gt; Method  combination to Analyze &amp;gt; Existing Deck&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full Run  and click Edit Input File&amp;hellip;&lt;br&gt;
Patran finds the bulk data file with the current job name and displays the file for editing in a text editing
window.
Input File Processing (IPF) Checking
Checking of MSC Nastran bulk data entries are done during IFP . When one of these entries has erroneous
data entered, the IFP will flag the entry and issue a FATAL ERROR . One needs to examine the output ( .fo6 )
to observe the field and continuation line where the erroneous data occurs.
SOL 400 uses the Nastran input format which are same as elements, materials, properties, loadings and
formats.&lt;/p&gt;

As a part of the input, you can request which results quantities you want to be written to the output from
MSC Nastran, and also what formats ( MASTER /DBALL , OP2, HDF5 ) of the results files to use. These output
requests are placed in the case control section of the input (refer to the example below).&lt;/p&gt;

Main Index
While the DISPLACEMENT , SPCFORCES , and STRESS  requests are common with most MSC Nastran
solution sequences, the NLSTRESS  and BOUTPUT  requests are unique to SOL 400 and are required to get
the output unique to nonlinear analyses such as failure indices and contact interaction status, forces and
stresses. Control of these options is available through the Analysis  menu job setup interface in Patran (see
Chapter 8 or the Patran MSC Nastran Preference Guide  for more information on this topic).

MSC recommends to us either the MASTER /DBALL  or new OP2 (PARAM,POST,1 ) output file formats for
SOL 400 analysis. The advantage of using the MASTER /DBALL  format is that it contains all of the database
information from the MSC Nastran run and so can be used to retrieve the attributes of the model at a later
time. The disadvantages to this format is that it is platform specific (e.g. not portable across platforms) and
takes up more disk space. The advantages of the new OP2 format is that it takes less disk space than the
MASTER /DBALL  and has limited cross-platform portability (see Chapter 2: File Management Statements,
The File Management Section (FMS)  of the QRG  for more details on portability).
The .sts file
SOL 400 provides a status file that can be queried periodically to see how the analysis is progressing and if
the job is completed. If not, how much of it was completed before the analysis was terminated. The easiest
way to have a real-time monitor of your SOL 400 job is to open the .sts file with a text editor that
automatically updates when the file is changed. The name of an STS file consists of the root name of the job
and the extension of STS, for instance, jobname.sts .
While an STS file provides MSC Nastran users a convenient and succinct means to monitor the incremental
solution process and examine the relevant information of the overall iteration procedure, a sophisticated user
is encouraged to look into the F06 file for the nonlinear iteration module output, which is led by the percent
sign % in each entry. The .f06 file provides all nonlinear solution information.
Postprocessing with Patran
The results application in Patran provides the capabilities for creating, modifying, deleting, posting, un-
posting and manipulating results visualization plots as well as viewing the finite element model. In addition,
results can be derived, interpolated, extrapolated, transformed, and averaged in a variety of ways, which can
be controlled by you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran: SOL 400 Getting Started Manual
SOL 400 Output File48
Main Index
Control is provided for manipulating the color/range assignment and other attributes for plot tools, and for
controlling, and creating animations of static, and transient results. Results are selected from the database,
and assigned to plot tools using simple forms. Results transformations are provided to derive scalars from
vectors, and tensors as well as to derive vectors from tensors. This allows for a wide variety of visualization
tools to be used with all of the available results.
If the job was created within Patran where a Patran jobname has the same name as the MSC Nastran
jobname, you are only required to use the Results  tools and Patran will import or attach the
jobname.xxx  file without you having to select it. If you did not create the job in Patran, you can still import
the model and results and postprocess.
Results
Like the enormous amount of data needed to define the simulation model to an analysis code, there is a large
volume of data returned from the simulation analysis. And just as it is virtually impossible to construct a
model with a text editor alone, it is equally difficult to read and interpret the results by hand. Hence, the use
of a postprocessor with a graphical user interface such as Patran, or SimXpert is highly recommended.
The Patran Results  application gives you control of powerful graphical capabilities to display results
quantities in a variety of ways:
Deformed structural plots
Color banded fringe plots
Marker plots (vectors, tensors)
Freebody diagrams
Graph (XY) plots
Animations of most of these plot types.
The Results  application treats all results quantities in a very flexible and general manner. In addition, for
maximum flexibility results can be:
Sorted
Reported
Filtered
Derived
Deleted
All of the above features help give meaningful insight into results interpretation of engineering problems that
would otherwise be difficult.
The Results  application is object oriented, providing postprocessing plots which are created, displayed, and
manipulated to obtain rapid insight into the nature of results data. The imaging is intended to provide
graphics performance sufficient for real time manipulation. Performance will vary depending on hardware,
but consistency of functionality is maintained as much as possible across all supported display devices.
Capabilities for interactive results postprocessing also exist. Advanced visualization capabilities allow creation
of many plot types which can be saved, simultaneously plotted, and interactively manipulated with results
quantities reported at the click of the mouse button to better understand mechanical behavior. Once defined,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;49 CHAPTER 4
SOL 400 Files
Main Index
the visualization plots remain in the database for immediate access and provide the means for results
manipulation and review in a consistent and easy to use manner.
For more information, see Chapter 1: Introduction to Results Postprocessing  in the Patran Reference Manual .

Executive Control Statements
The SOL 400 executive control statement is as follows:
SOL 400
See Chapter 2: MSC Nastran Files, The Executive Control Section Overview  for a description on some of the
options.
Solution Type
MSC Nastran SOL 400 can simulate different types of structural and thermal responses. In general, an
structural analysis can be either static or dynamic. Both static, and dynamic analysis may simulate linear
response, or nonlinear response. SOL 400 incorporates the formulations and functionality to simulate
nonlinear static and dynamic structural responses.
Specifying the Solution Type
The specific procedure MSC Nastran will run is specified on the ANALYSIS  case control entry. SOL 400
represents multiple types of analysis procedures including structural, thermal, or multi-physics; any of which
can be specified using the case control entries (see Analysis Procedures  on how to use case control to specify the
analysis procedures, including multi-physics/multistep).
Steps and Subcases
Creating multiple steps allows you to simulate complex loading histories and even mix, and match different
analysis procedures as required to get an accurate and efficient solution. Each step is a collection of loads and
boundary conditions that define one phase of the behavior being modeled. For SOL 400, nonlinear analysis
runs the starting point of each step is the ending point of the previous step.
Creating multiple subcases allows you to stack simulations and efficiently analyze multiple stand-alone jobs
in one run. Each subcase should represent a complete stand-alone loading history, while gaining the
efficiency of not having to re-form any matrices that can be re-used. In SOL 400, multi-subcase runs the
starting point of each subcase is an unstressed, un-deformed state that is completely independent of the
previous subcase .Entry Description
ANALYSIS Specifies the analysis procedure to be used for the step or subcase being set up.&lt;/p&gt;

Specifying Subcases
Each subcase is designated with the following case control commands:
Multi-step or Multi-subcase Analyses
SOL 400 analysis allows for six analysis type combinations:
Nonlinear single physics
Nonlinear chained physics
Nonlinear coupled physics
Linear perturbation analysis
Nonlinear chained analysis with mesh/time change physics, and
Standard linear physics.&lt;br&gt;
If there are multiple subcases, the linear subcases will be solved first.
The general rule for this is: The solutions of all SUBCASE s are independent of each other. The solution  of any
STEP  is a continuation of the solution of the previous STEP  in the same SUBCASE . The solutions of the
SUBSTEP s occur sequentially within a STEP  (coupled analysis).Entry Description
SUBCASE Delimits and identifies a subcase.
STEP Delimits and identifies a section of a subcase, typically delineating one load step, or
perturbation step in the analysis (see Chapter 4: Solution Strategies for Nonlinear
Analysis, on multi-stepping for a more detailed explanation of how STEP s and
SUBCASEs  work together).&lt;/p&gt;

Elements
Main Index
Introduction
An element is the basic building block of finite element analysis (FEA). There are several basic types of
elements. Which type of element is used for the analysis depends on two factors:
The type of analysis that is going to be performed
The type of object that is to be modeled
An element is a mathematical relation that defines how the degrees of freedom of a node relate to the next.
It also relates how the deflections create stresses. Elements can be:
Lines (trusses or beams)
Areas (2-D or 3-D plates and membranes)
Solids (bricks or tetrahedrals)
The element is used as a mechanism to integrate a physical quantity over a volume, a surface, a curve, or a
point. For the simplest simulation, it provides a transfer function (or impedance) between the degrees of
freedom of one grid and the degrees of freedom of another grid. This is a very general definition which may
be applied to any type of physics including structural analysis, thermal analysis, acoustic analysis, and fluid
dynamics among others.
The selection of the element type and the design of the finite element mesh are important to obtain an
accurate solution. The design of a finite element mesh is done either fully automatically by a mesh generator
available from MSC (Patran, SimXpert) or any other mesh generator available in the market.
In MSC Nastran, there are two aspects of element definition:
1.The definition of the location of the element, by identifying grid points comprising the element. This
is often called the element topology.
2.The definition of the characteristics of the element.
For nonlinear analysis, the topology of the elements, is generally the same for linear analysis (SOL 101) and
for nonlinear analysis (SOL 400), though there are some restrictions. Additionally, there are elements
available in the implicit nonlinear procedure that are not available in the linear solution sequences. For a
detailed description of MSC Nastran element technology, see the MSC Nastran Linear Static Analysis User’s
Guide , MSC Nastran Elements  (Ch. 4), MSC Nastran Reference Guide , Structural Elements  (Ch. 3) and QRG , Bulk
Data Entries .
Element Classes
In MSC Nastran, the elements are divided into classes based upon their dimensionality and function. In
structural applications such as automotive body, aerospace, and civil engineering, the use of shells, beams,
and rods is prevalent. In applications such as generators, rockets, and pressure vessels, axisymmetric elements
may be used advantageously; while in automotive engines, housing, etc., 3-D solid elements dominate.
MSC Nastran uses Standard and Advanced elements. Standard elements are the native Nastran elements
which are popular for linear static and dynamic analyses. The elements CQUAD, CTRIA, CHEXA,
CPENTA, CTETRA, CBEAM and CBAR are available in both standard and advanced element versions and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran: SOL 400 Getting Started Manual
Element Classes54
Main Index
these elements provide identical solutions for all linear simulations. The standard elements are defined using
conventional property cards PSHELL, PLPLANE, PSOLID, PBEAM, PBAR, etc.
Advanced elements are activated explicitly by using additional property cards  (in addition to conventional
property card) PSHLN1, PSHLN2, PSLDN1, PBEMN1 and PBARN1. While Nastran uses its standard
elements mostly for the linear simulations and also for the limited nonlinear simulations in SOL 106 and
SOL 129, it uses its advanced elements for more advanced nonlinear  simulations (large strain material and
contact nonlinear solutions) in SOL 400. Few advanced elements (new type which have no equivalent in
standard element type) are also directly defined using only the conventional property cards (PLCOMP ,
PCOMPLS, PCOHE, PAXISYM, etc.).
Nastran also allows the capability of automatic activation of advanced elements when the model uses certain
nonlinear materials or analysis procedures. For more information, refer to See “Automatic Property Mapping”
on page 79.
0-D
0-D elements are a single grid; hence, they do not really have a geometry associated with them. Because of
this, no numerical integration is required.
These elements include:
CELAS1 , CELAS2 , CELAS3 , and CELAS4  (if only one grid identified) – provides a stiffness matrix
CBUSH  (if only one grid identified) – provides a stiffness, damping and mass matrix
CDAMP1 , CDAMP2 , CDAMP3 , and CDAMP4  (if only one grid identified) – provides a damping
matrix
CMASS1 , CMASS2 , CMASS3 , and CMASS4  (if only one grid identified) – provides a mass matrix
CONM1  and CONM2  – provides a mass/inertia matrix
Note that only CBUSH  allows the ability to change the stiffness due to the deformation, and hence, is more
powerful for nonlinear analysis.

1-D Elements – Not Numerically Integrated
1-D elements that have two grid (or scalar) points, but have no geometry, do not need to be numerally
integrated. They effectively represent a spring or damper between two points. These elements include:
CELAS1 , CELAS2 , CELAS3 , and CELAS4  – provides a stiffness matrix
CBUSH  – provides a stiffness, damping and mass matrix.
CDAMP1 , CDAMP2 , CDAMP3 , and CDAMP4  – provides a damping matrix.
Note that only CBUSH  allows the ability to change the stiffness due to the deformation and, hence, is more
powerful for nonlinear analysis.
The property options used with these elements are:

Physically, these elements represent slender structures, where the behavior may be considered uniaxial and
the stresses in the other directions are negligible.CDAMP4 Not Required Not Applicable

Beam Element Considerations
When beam elements are used in an engineering simulation, the following considerations need to be made:
Beam cross-section definition – this is the same for linear solutions and nonlinear solutions.
Beam section orientation – the beam cross section may be either a solid section, an open section, or
a hollow closed section. The definition of the beam section cross section is the same for classical and
advanced elements, but the numerical procedure is different. When using the advanced elements
and closed section cross sections, there is an additional restriction in that the cross section may have
only one cavity.
A detailed description of beam cross section and beam orientations is given in the QRG .
Beam cross-section integration – this is substantially different for nonlinear analysis when the
additional property option. In the case of linear elastic material behavior, the cross section of the
beam is integrated to obtain the area, moments of inertia, and the torsional moment. When
nonlinear material models are present, the behavior has to be integrated through the cross section.
Beam offsets – MSC Nastran has two different methods to apply Beam and Shell offsets:
a.Using rigid elements which is the default.
a.Large rotation method activated by the MDLPRM,OFFDEF,LROFF  – this is the recommended
approach for a nonlinear analysis.
Beam pin codes – this is the same for linear and nonlinear solutions.

The CBAR , PBAR , and PBARN1  does not support LCO which requires element warping.
The cross-section behavior can either be specified by entering an S or N on the SECT  option, where N means
numerically integrated and S means smeared. When a nonlinear material behavior needs to be captured, you
should use the N option.
Large Displacement/Large Strain
These 1-D elements support large displacement and large rotation. The beam elements do not support large
strain in the sense that the cross-section geometry, whether solid section, open section, or closed section, does
not change. The CROD  element does support large strain, but it is assumed to be incompressible such that
the volume remains constant, hence:
A*L = A0L0 / L
The resultant quantities are always given with respect to an element axis attached to the 1-D element. When
large displacement is included, this is co-rotated with the element.
Planar Continuum Elements
This is a group of elements that include plane stress, plane strain, and axisymmetric elements. The advanced

2-D Axisymmetric Elements with Twist

elements uniformly twist in the circumferential direction. The coordinates must be aligned with the basic X-
Y system; which is interpreted as the R-Z system. Nonlinear analysis does not support superposition, so the
use of Harmonic (Fourier) analysis to describe a load variation in the circumferential direction is not

Large Displacement/Large Strain
All of the 2-D plane stress, plane strain, axisymmetric, and axisymmetric with twist support large
displacements and large rotations. For plane stress elements, the thickness of the element is updated due to
the in-plane membrane distortion.
The output of the results is always in the basic coordinate system.
Axisymmetric Shell Elements
MSC Nastran does support the use of axisymmetric shell elements that is entered as the CAXISYM  in SOL
400. This element may be used as either a 2-node linear element or a 3-node quadratic element. It is not
available for the classical linear solution sequences. The CCONEAX  may be used for linear solution
sequences, but it should not be used in nonlinear solution sequences.
To apply a distributed load on this element, one needs to apply the pressure using PLOADX1 . Note that the
distributed loads are integrated over one radian. Hence, any point force applied should also be prescribed

the definition of membranes, plates, and shells are done through the same topological classes. These element
satisfy plane-stress conditions as the normal stresses through the thickness are zero.
These elements exhibit significant differences between the classic and the advanced formulation. MSC
Nastran has multiple flavors of these elements:
Homogeneous linear behavior for combined membrane, bending and transverse shear.
Homogeneous linear behavior for pure membrane or bending or transverse shear.
Non-homogeneous linear behavior for combined membrane, bending and transverse shear.
Homogeneous nonlinear behavior for combined membrane, bending and transverse shear.
Homogeneous nonlinear behavior for membranes.
Layered (composite) behavior where material behavior is linear.
Layered (composite) behavior where material behavior is nonlinear.
Here, the word Homogeneous refers to the thickness direction. One can use user subroutines to vary the
material behavior over the surface of a membrane or shell element.
Material Nonlinear Behavior
If nonlinear material occurs in the model, the recommended solution is to use PSHLN1  and when using
composites, LAM on the PCOMP  or PCOMG  should not be set to SMEAR  or SMCORE .
Additionally, the NOCOMPS  parameter should be set to 1 to insure that the ply stresses, strains and failure
indices are calculated and available for output.
Pure Membrane Behavior
If pure membrane behavior is required than set BEH=MB  on the PSHLN1  option. This results in a membrane
element which utilizes only the translational degrees of freedom. This formulation has no resistance to
bending and caution may be required to insure non-singular behavior. When Large Displacement  is set, the
differential stiffness matrix is created and for tension based structures; such as balloons, a stable system will
occur.

Large Displacement/Large Strain
Whether one uses the classical MSC Nastran formulation or the advanced element formulation, these
elements support large displacement and large rotations. When using the advanced element formulation, the
membrane strains may become large, but the curvature strains remain small. The bending versions of these
elements always satisfy the Kirchhoff assumptions that the normal to the shell remains normal and plane
through the thickness remains a plane. If either of these assumptions are violated, one effectively has a three
dimensional stress distribution, and one should use solid elements.
Shear Panel
MSC Nastran supports a 4-node shear panel element for linear analysis. Here, linear analysis means small
deformation and linear isotropic elastic material.L Linear Displacement and Rotation

While SOL 400 has an alternative formulation when PSHEARN  is entered, it provides a membrane

3-D Solid Shell Element
The solid shell element is an element that may be used for structural problems that transition between shell
behavior and solid behavior. The element appears like a CHEXA element and is input using this option, but
it is an oriented element such that it has very good bending characteristics.
The solid shell element uses different integration schemes in the plane of element and in the thickness
direction of element:
In the element plane, it uses a reduced integration scheme with single integration point. An
additional variationally consistent stiffness term is included to eliminate the hourglass modes that
are normally associated with reduced integration.
In the thickness direction, the element is integrated numerically using differenr points through the
element thickness based upon if it is COMPOSITE or NON-COMPOSITE material. The
numerical integration for non-composite material is done using Simpson’s rule with 5 points, the
first and last points are located on the top and bottom surface. For composite material, every layer
will have three integration points with the first and third on the surface of each layer.
The following Figure 5-1 demonstrates the arrangement of the integration schemes for non-composite and
composite.
The element relaxes the Kirchhoff shell assumptions that normal remain normal, and it results in a full (6-
component) stress state. The element may be used either as a homogenous material or as a composite
(layered) material. It is not necessary to define the thickness because this is obtained directly from the
coordinates.
The element system has a local coordinate system which is updated with large displacements. In versions
prior to the MSC Nastran 2014 release, the results were given with respect to the basic coordinate system.
Currently, the results are given with respect to the local system.

Composite Solid Elements
There are a series of continuum elements that may also be used to model composite materials and are also
used for gasket simulations. These elements are available for plane strain, axisymmetric, and three-
dimensional behavior. These elements are conventional from the degrees of freedom perspective and the
interpolation functions. What makes them different from conventional elements is that in one direction,
there are multiple layers that support multiple materials. The advantage of these elements are that they are
relatively easy to use, but it should be recognized that they are not tuned for bending behavior and multiple
elements through the thickness may be required.
To activate the characteristics of these elements for composites, one needs to specify additional Property  data.3-D Solid

Gasket Elements
The lower-order continuum composite elements are also used to model gasket materials. When used in this
manner, the number of layers is one and the material is defined through the MATG  option. Note that these
elements may be collapsed to a pentahedral so they can model the gasket between two regions modeled with
tetrahedral elements. Care should be exercised to make sure the collapsing occurs in the plane of the gasket
material. It is not necessary that the elements match the mesh in the surrounding material. One may utilize
the contact capability to overcome the mesh incompatibility.
Interface Elements
There are a series of elements that are used to model the onset and progression of delamination of the
bonding materials using the Cohesive Zone Method. These elements are available for plane strain,
axisymmetric, and three-dimensional behavior. From a meshing perspective, these elements are unique ElementNumber of

because one can enter a zero thickness. The interface elements provide two integration schemes. The first uses
the conventional Gaussian integration scheme while the other uses a nodal lumping scheme (Lobatto-Cotes).
The latter scheme may be advantageous when the interface material is relatively stiff compared to the
surrounding material.
Note that the orientation of the element dictates the direction of the interface/delamination. It is not
necessary that the elements match the mesh in the surrounding material. One may utilize the contact
capability to overcome the mesh incompatibility. The material properties are defined using the MCOHE&lt;br&gt;
material model Cohesive Zone Modeling (MCOHE) . Note that delamination simulations are highly
nonlinear and one must exercise caution in applying the boundary conditions.
The element is written with respect to a local coordinate system, relating the relative displacement and the
normal and shear traction. The output is given with respect to the local coordinate system. This system is
updated (rotated) when large displacement is used. The element does not include a mass matrixor a geometric
or initial stress stiffness matrix. It also does not support application of distribute loads.
The higher-order elements are not fully quadratic; they are quadratic in the plane of the interface but linear
through the thickness.
The elements are shown below.

Automatic Property Mapping
The “SPROPMAP ” keyword in the NLMOPTS  bulk data entry provides a convenient option to automatically
flag secondary properties like PBARN1 , PBEMN1 , PRODN1 , PSHEARN , PSHLN1 , PSHLN2 , and PSLDN1 . Note
that these secondary property entries expose the user to a set of sophisticated 2-D continuum, 3-D beam,
shell, and continuum elements in SOL 400. The rules governing the flagging of the additional properties are
many and are a function of the problem dimension, material type and procedure. All these rules have been
incorporated into the automatic flagging option. These are briefly summarized in the following table:CIFPENT 15 6

Material Model Overview
A wide variety of materials are encountered in structural analysis problems, and for any one of these materials
a range of constitutive models is available to describe the material&amp;rsquo;s behavior. We can broadly classify the
materials of interest as those which exhibit the following behavior:
Elastic – which fully recovers when the load is removed
Rate dependent – where the behavior is dependent upon the rate of the deformations. This includes
viscoelastic materials like rubber and glass
Inelastic – which do not recover when loads are removed and demonstrate permanent deformation.
These materials include metals represented by elastic-plastic materials, ice, and material that exhibits
damage.
The following sections describe how to model material behavior in SOL 400. Modeling material behavior
consists of both specifying the constitutive models used to describe the material behavior and defining the
actual material data necessary to represent the material. Directional dependency can be included for materials
other than isotropic materials. Each section discusses the constitutive (stress strain) relation, provides graphic
representation of the models, and includes recommendations and cautions concerning the use of the models.
Material Property Definitions
It is assumed that the material is a continuum and the material properties remain constant. This means that
the material does not contain gaps or voids and the temperature of the structure is constant.
Definition and properties of materials are listed in the Table 6-1.
Table 6-1  Definitions and Properties of Materials
If the loading on a structure is sufficient to exceed the linear elastic limit of the material, then nonlinear
methods are required to predict the nature of the plastically (permanently) deformed state.Linear Deformations are directly proportional to the applied load (i.e., strain is
directly proportional to stress).
Elastic An elastic structure returns to its original, undeformed shape when the load is
removed.
Homogeneous The material is the same throughout — material properties are independent
of location within the material.
Isotropic Material properties do not change with the direction of the material.
Modulus of elasticity
(Young’s modulus) EE is the constant of proportionality relating stress-to-strain for uniaxial
behavior in the linear region. The greater the value of E, the stiffer the
material.
Shear modulus (Modulus
of rigidity) GG is the constant of proportionality relating shear stress to shear strain in the
linear region.
Poisson’s ratio It is the absolute value of the ratio of lateral linear strain to axial linear strain.&lt;/p&gt;

A typical stress–strain curve of structural steel is shown in the Figure 6-1.
Figure 6-1  Stress–Strain Curve of Structural Steel
Modeling of nonlinear material behavior is a critical component to obtain the structural response of
structures; especially, when either the loads are large, the temperatures are high, and/or the non-metallic
material is used. MSC Nastran SOL 400 provides a variety of models and, in some cases, multiple numerical
implementation of these models. This latter is due to the historical incorporation of solution sequences 106
and 129. The newer implementations of material models is based upon incorporating technology from Marc
and is the preferred approach. The newer material formulation also requires the use of the newer element
methodology which is often labeled the “advanced” elements. Aspects of these elements are described in
Chapter 11: Element Library . Hence, to use the advanced material models, it is necessary to supplement the
traditional property entries with new property entries ( PBARN1 , PBEMN1 , PRODN1 , PSHLN1 ,
PSHLN2 , and PSLDN1 ). An alternate approach is to use the NLMOPTS  bulk data option with the
PROPMAP  keyword.
SOL 400 Material Entries
The following material bulk data entries are available in SOL 400. An overview of each of these options is
presented in the sections of this chapter and detailed in the QRG , Chapter 8: Bulk Data Entries . All standard
MSC Nastran materials are also available in SOL 400.&lt;/p&gt;

Main Index
The following sections describe how to model material behavior in SOL 400. Modeling material behavior
consists of both specifying the constitutive models used to describe the material behavior and defining the
actual material data necessary to represent the material. Directional dependency can be included for materials
other than isotropic materials. Data for the materials can be entered either directly through the input file or
by user subroutines, or material models may be defined in the Patran Materials Application . Each section of
this chapter discusses various options for organizing material data for input. Each section also discusses the
constitutive (stress -strain) relation and graphic representation of the models and includes recommendations
and cautions concerning the use of the models.
Linear Elastic Behavior
SOL 400 is capable of handling problems with any combination of isotropic, orthrotropic, or anisotropic
linear elastic material behavior.
The isotropic linear elastic model is the model most commonly used to represent engineering materials. This
model, which has a linear relationship between stresses and strains, is represented by Hooke’s Law. Figure 6-2
shows that stress is proportional to strain in a uniaxial tension test. The ratio of stress to strain is the familiar
definition of modulus of elasticity (Young’s modulus) of the material.
E (modulus of elasticity) = (axial stress)/(axial strain) (6-1)
Figure 6-2  Uniaxial Stress-Strain Relation of Linear Elastic Material
Experiments show that axial elongation is always accompanied by lateral contraction of the bar. The ratio for
a linear elastic material is:
v = (lateral contraction)/(axial elongation)
This is known as Poisson’s ratio. Similarly, the shear modulus (modulus of rigidity) is defined as:
G (shear modulus) = (shear stress)/(shear strain) (6-2)Stress

Element Selection for Incompressible Materials
A Poisson’s ratio of 0.5, which would be appropriate for an incompressible material, can be used for the
following elements: plane stress, shell, truss, or beam. A Poisson’s ratio which is close (but not equal) to 0.5
can be used for constant dilation elements and reduced integration elements in situations which do not
include other severe kinematic constraints. Using a Poisson’s ratio close to 0.5 for all other elements usually
leads to behavior that is too stiff. A Poisson’s ratio of 0.5 can also be used with the updated Lagrangian
formulation in the multiplicative decomposition framework using the standard displacement elements. In
these elements, the treatment for incompressibility is transparent.
Linear Elastic Materials
A wide variety of materials are encountered in stress analysis problems, and for any one of these materials a
range of constitutive models are available to describe the material&amp;rsquo;s behavior, including directional
dependencies. We can broadly classify the materials of interest as those which exhibit almost no directional
dependence (isotropic materials), versus those that exhibit three mutually orthogonal planes of symmetry
(orthogonal materials), versus those that exhibit different elastic properties in different directions (anisotropic
materials).
Isotr opic Mater ials
Most linear elastic materials are assumed to be isotropic (their elastic properties are the same in all directions).
For an isotropic material, every plane is a plane of symmetry and every direction is an axis of symmetry. It
can be shown that for an isotropic material:
G = E / (2(1+v)) (6-3)
The shear modulus G can be easily calculated if the modulus of e lasticity E and Poisson’s ratio v areknown.Material Characteristics

Main Index
The data required to perform this analysis are the static material constants like Young&amp;rsquo;s moduls and Poisson&amp;rsquo;s
ratio or the material constants used in the strain energy function of a hyperelastic material. In a viscoelastic
analysis these material constants correspond to the instantaneous or short term behavior of the material. In
addition viscoelastic material data are needed to describe the rate effects in the material.
Viscoelastic analysis can be performed in the time domain or in the frequency domain.
In time domain viscoelasticity we study the transient response due to arbitrary time varying loads to capture
the rate effects in the deformation process.
In the time domain two models are available:
The hereditary integral model  for linear viscoelasticity and the Simo model  for nonlinear
viscoelasticity. The Simo model is an extension of the linear model to finite strain viscoelasticity and
leads to similar hereditary integrals as the linear model.
The Bergstrom-Boyce (B-B) model , which is a phenomenological highly nonlinear model.
In frequency domain viscoelastity we study the stationary dynamic response due to harmonic loads to capture
the rate effects in the deformation process. The stationary response due to harmonic loads that are applied
with a certain excitation frequency is a response with the same frequency. Frequency domain viscoelasticity
is always based on a linear perturbation around a static equilibrium state, which can be the undeformed stress-
free state or some other deformed equilibrium state and is therefore limited to small amplitude vibrations
around the static equilibrium state. Frequency domain viscoelasticity leads to the concepts of storage modulus
and loss modulus, which characterize the frequency dependent stiffness and damping properties of a material.
Within the considered amplitude range, the size of the amplitude may still have a substantial effect on the
harmonic response, which is known as the Payne effect or Fletcher-Gent effect. With the Payne effect, storage
modulus and loss modulus of a material also become vibration amplitude dependent, turning the frequency&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;97 Chapter 6: Materials

response problem into a nonlinear problem. Without the Payne effect the frequency response problem is
always linear.
In the frequency domain the hereditary integral models for linear viscoelasticity and nonlinear viscoelasticity
(Simo model) are available only. The Bergstrom-Boyce model is not available in the frequency domain.
Because of the presence of damping there is energy dissipation, which in general will be frequency dependent
Viscoelasticity can be applied:
To determine the current state of deformation based on the entire time history of loading.
To include temperature dependencies.
To use in conjunction of isotropic, orthotropic, and anisotropic material for small strain problems.
To use in conjunction with rubber or foam material for large strain problems.
Hereditary Integral Model
The stress-strain equations in viscoelasticity are not only dependent on the current stress and strain state (as
represented in the Kelvin model), but also on the entire history of development of these states. This
constitutive behavior is most readily expressed in terms of hereditary or Duhamel integrals. These integrals
are formed by considering the stress or strain build-up at successive times. T wo equivalent integral forms
exist: the stress relaxation form and the creep function form. In SOL 400, the stress relaxation form is used.
Isotropic Viscoelastic Material
For an isotropic viscoelastic material, SOL 400 assumes that the deviatoric and volumetric behavior are fully
uncoupled and that the behavior can be described by a time dependent shear and bulk modules. The bulk
moduli is generally assumed to be time independent; however, this is an unnecessary restriction of the general
theory.
Large Strain Viscoelasticity
For an elastomeric time independent material, the constitutive equation is expressed in terms of an energy
function W. For a large strain viscoelastic material, Simo generalized the small strain viscoelasticity material
behavior to a large strain viscoelastic material.
Thermal-Rheologically Simple Materials
The relaxation behavior of most viscoelastic materials is temperature dependent. For many of these materials
it is observed that when displaying the relaxation curves for different temperatures on a logarithmic time
scale, the shape of the curves doesn&amp;rsquo;t change, but they shift along the logarithmic time axis as shown for two
normalized relaxation curves in figure Figure 6-3. Such material behavior is called Thermo-Rheologically
simple (TRS) material behavior. In general it is expected that when the temperature is higher than the
reference temperature, the relaxation is faster so the curve makes a left-shift and when the temperature is
lower than the reference temperature, the relaxation is slower so the curve makes a right-shift
A “reduced” or “pseudo” time can be defined for the materials of this type and for a given temperature field.
This new parameter is a function of both time and space variables. The viscoelastic law has the same form as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran Getting Started Guide
Viscoelastic   98
Main Index
one at constant temperature in real time. If the shifted time is used, however, the transformed viscoelastic
equilibrium and compatibility equations are not equivalent to the corresponding elastic equations.
In the case where the temperature varies with time, the extended constitutive law implies a nonlinear
dependence of the instantaneous stress state at each material point of the body upon the entire local
temperature history. In other words, the functionals are linear in the strains but nonlinear in the temperature.
The time scale of experimental data is extended for Thermo-Rheologically Simple materials. All characteristic
functions of the material must obey the same property. The shift function is a basic property of the material
andmust be determined experimentally. As a consequence of the shifting of the mechanical properties data
parallel to the time axis (see Figure 6-3), the values of the zero and infinite frequency complex moduli do not
change due to shifting. Hence, elastic materials with temperature-dependent characteristics neither belong to
nor are consistent with the above hypothesis for the class of Thermo -Rheologically Simple viscoelastic solids.
Figure 6-3  Relaxation Modulus vs. Time at Different Temperatures
Narayanaswamy Model
The annealing of flat glass requires that the residual stresses be of an acceptable magnitude, while the
specification for optical glass components usually includes a homogenous refractive index. The design of heat
treated processes (for example, annealing) can be accomplished using the Narayanaswamy model. This allows
you to study the time dependence of physical properties (for example, volumes) of glass subjected to a change
in temperature.
The glass transition is a region of temperature in which molecular rearrangements occur on a scale of minutes
or hours, so that the properties of a liquid change at a rate that is easily observed. Below the glass transition
temperature Tg, the material is extremely viscous and a solidus state exists. Above Tg, the equilibrium
structure is arrived at easily and the material is in liquidus state. Hence, the glass transition is revealed by a
change in the temperature dependence of some property of a liquid during cooling. If a mechanical stress is
applied to a liquid in the transition region, a time -dependent change in dimensions results due to the
phenomenon of visco -elasticity.
If a liquid in the transition region is subjected to a sudden change in temperature, a time -dependent change
in volume occurs as shown in Figure 6-4. The latter process is called structural relaxation. Hence, structural
relaxation governs the time -dependent response of a liquid to a change of temperature.GTT0

The viscoelastic MATVE  and MATTVE  material entries are provided for cases where dissipative losses
caused by “viscous” (internal friction) effects in materials must be modeled. For time domain analysis, this
option is used with an elastic model to define classical linear, small strain, viscoelastic behavior, or with
hyperelastic or foam models to define finite linear, large deformation, viscoelastic behavior. As described in
the previous section, viscoelastic relaxation data can be fit using the experimental data fitting capability
available in Patran.
Elasto-plastic Behavior
Most materials of engineering interest initially respond elastically. Elastic behavior means that the
deformation is fully recoverable, so that, when the load is removed, the specimen returns to its original shape.
If the load exceeds some limit (the “yield load”), the deformation is no longer fully recoverable. Some parts
of the deformation will remain when the load is removed as, for example, when a paper clip is bent too much, Entry Description

or when a billet of metal is rolled or forged in a manufacturing process. Plasticity theories model the material’s
mechanical response as it undergoes such nonrecoverable deformation in a ductile fashion. The theories have
been developed most intensively for metals, but they are applied to soils, concrete, rock, and ice. These
materials behave in very different ways (for example, even large values of pure hydrostatic pressure cause very
little inelastic deformation in metals, but quite small hydrostatic pressure may cause a significant, non-
recoverable volume change in a soil sample), but the fundamental concepts of plasticity theories are
sufficiently general that models based on these concepts have been successfully developed for a wide range of
materials. A number of these plasticity modes are available in the SOL 400 material library.
In nonlinear material behavior, the material parameters depend on the state of stress. Up to the proportional
limit, i.e., the point at which linearity in material behavior ceases, the linear elastic formulation for the
behavior can be used. Beyond that point, and especially after the onset of yield, nonlinear formulations are
required. In general, two ingredients are required to ascertain material behavior:
1.an initial yield criterion to determine the state of stress at which yielding is considered to begin
2.mathematical rules to explain the post-yielding behavior
There are two major theories of plastic behavior that address these criterion differently. In the first, called
deformation theory , the plastic strains are uniquely defined by the state of stress. The second theory, called flow
or incremental  theory, expresses the increments of plastic strain (irrecoverable strains) as functions of the
current stress, the strain increments, and the stress increments. Incremental theory is more general and can
be adapted in its particulars to fit a variety of material behaviors. The plasticity models in SOL 400 are
“incremental” theories, in which the mechanical strain rate is decomposed into an elastic part and a plastic
(inelastic) part through various assumed flow rules.
The incremental plasticity models are formulated in terms of:
A yield surface , which generalizes the concept of “yield load” into a test function which can be used
to determine if the material will respond purely elastically at a particular state of stress, temperature,
etc.;
A flow  rule that defines the inelastic deformation that must occur if the material point is no longer
responding purely elastically;
and some evolution laws that define the hardening  – the way in which the yield and/or flow
definitions change as inelastic deformation occurs.
The models also need an elasticity definition, to deal with the recoverable part of the strain models divide
into those that are rate-dependent and those that are rate-independent.
SOL 400 includes the following models of inelastic behavior.
Metal Plasticity (von Mises, Hill, or Barlat)
Pressure-Dependent models – models the behavior of granular (soil and rock) materials or polymers,
in which the yield behavior depends on the equivalent pressure stress.

Stress/Strain Curve – All stress -strain curves are input as piecewise linear. Patran transfers the stress-
strain curve input on the material property field directly to the TABLES1  entry.
The number of linear segments used to define the stress-strain curve may be different from one
material to another. The same strain breakpoints need not be used for all of the different material’s
stress -strain curves. It is recommended to define the stress -strain curves throughout the range of
strains which the analysis is likely to predict. If the analysis predicts a plastic strain greater than the
last point defined by you, SOL 400 continues the analysis after shifting the last strain breakpoint on
that curve to match the predicted value, thereby changing (reducing) the work hardening slope for
the last segment of the curve.

Strain rate effects cause the structural response of a body to change because they influence the material
properties of the body. These material changes lead to an instantaneous change in the strength of the
material. Strain rate effects become more pronounced for temperatures greater than half the melting
temperature ( Tm ), but are sometimes present even at room temperature.
Yield stress variation with strain rate is given using one of four options:
1.The breakpoints and slopes for a piecewise linear approximation to the yield stress strain rate curve
are given. The strain rate breakpoints should be in ascending order, or
2.The Cowper and Symonds model is used. The yield behavior is assumed to be completely determined
by one stress-strain curve and a scale factor depending on the strain rate.

A material is said to be “perfectly plastic” if, upon the stress state touching the yield surface, an infinitesimal
increase in stress causes an arbitrarily large plastic strain. The uniaxial stress -strain diagram for an elastic-

Creep (MATVP, CREEP)
Creep is an important factor in elevated-temperature stress analysis. In SOL 400, creep is represented by a
Maxwell model. Creep is a time-dependent, inelastic behavior, and can occur at any stress level (that is, either
below or above the yield stress of a material). The creep behavior can be characterized as primary, secondary,
and tertiary creep, as shown in ( Figure 6-6). Engineering analysis is often limited to the primary and secondary
creep regions. T ertiary creep in a uniaxial specimen is usually associated with geometric instabilities, such as
necking. The major difference between the primary and secondary creep is that the creep strain rate is much
larger in the primary creep region than it is in the secondary creep region. The creep strain rate is the slope
of the creep strain-time curve. The creep strain rate is generally dependent on stress, temperature, and time.
The creep data can be specified in either an exponent form or in a piecewise linear curve.

Viscoplasticity (Explicit Formulation)
The creep (Maxwell) model can be modified to include a plastic element (as shown in Figure 6-7). This plastic
element is inactive when the stress ( ) is less than the yield stress ( y) of the material. The modified model
is an elasto-viscoplasticity model and is capable of producing some observed effects of creep and plasticity. In
addition, the viscoplastic model can be used to generate time -independent plasticity solutions when
stationary conditions are reached. At the other extreme, the viscoplastic model can reproduce standard creep
phenomena. The model allows the treatment of nonassociated flow rules and strain softening which present
difficulties in conventional (tangent modulus) plasticity analyses.
It is recommended that you use the implicit formulation described in the following paragraphs to model
general viscoplastic materials.Note: Primary Creep: Fast decrease in creep strain rate

Creep (Implicit Formulation)
This formulation, as opposed to that described in the previous section, is fully implicit. A fully implicit
formulation is unconditionally stable for any choice of time step size; hence, allowing a larger time step than
permissible using the explicit method. Additionally, this is more accurate than the explicit method. The
disadvantage is that each increment may be more computationally expensive. There are two methods for
defining the inelastic strain rate. The creep model definition option can be used to define a Maxwell creep
model. The back stress must be specified through the field reserved for the yield stress in the MAT1  or other
material definitions. There is no creep strain when the stress is less than the back stress. The equivalent creep
strain increment is expressed as
(6-7)
and the inelastic deviatoric strain components are
where ij is the deviatoric stress at the end of the increment and y is the back stress. A is a function of
temperature, time, etc. Creep only occurs if  sigma is greater y.
One of three tangent matrices may be formed. The first uses an elastic tangent, which requires more
iterations, but can be computationally efficient because re-assembly might not be required. The second uses
an algorithmic tangent that provides the best behavior for small strain power law creep. The third uses a
secant (approximate) tangent that gives the best behavior for general viscoplastic models.
As an example of the usage of MATVP  for defining the creep behavior, see Creep of a Tube  (Ch. 34) in the
Demonstration Problems Manual - Implicit Nonlinear .
ANAND Solder Creep Model
In the process of IC produce and package, solder is widely used to connect different chips or lines, its creep
behavior has significantly influence of the IC performance and durability. ANAND model is widely accepted
in IC industries to describe the creep behavior of solder materials. Enhanced capability of SOL 400 with
ANAND creep model will benefit all current and potential Nastran users.

Main Index
Compo site (PCOMP or PCOMPG)
Composite materials are composed of a mixture of two or more constituents, giving them mechanical and
thermal properties which can be significantly better than those of homogeneous metals, polymers and
ceramics.
Laminate composite materials are based on layering homogeneous materials using one of several methods. In
order to define a laminate composite material, you must define the homogeneous materials that form the
layers, the thickness of each layer, and the orientation angle of the layers relative to the standard coordinate
axis being used for the model. The orientation is particularly important for orthotropic and anisotropic
materials, whose properties vary in different directions. The material in each layer may be either linear or
nonlinear. Tightly bonded layers (layered materials) are often stacked in the thickness direction of beam,
plate, shell structures, or solids.
Figure 6-9 identifies the locations of integration points through the thickness of beam and shell elements with
and without a composite formulation.
Note that when the COMPOSITE option is used, as shown in Figure 6-9, the layer points are positioned
midway through each layer. When the COMPOSITE  option is not used, the layer points are equidistantly STNRT Strain rate sensitivity of stress. M

MSC Nastran has a library of interface elements, which can be used to simulate the onset and progress of
delamination. These elements are defined with the CIFHEX , CIFPENT , CIFQDX , and CIFQUAD  bulk
data entries. The constitutive behavior of these elements is expressed in terms of tractions versus relative
displacements between the top and bottom edge/surface of the elements (see Figure 6-12).

Considering a 3-D interface element, the relative displacement components are given by one normal and two
shear components, expressed with respect to the local element system:

Progressive Composite Failure
Main Index
different methods for the material degradation as described below. While MSC Nastran allows up to three
failure criteria to be used for failure index calculation, only the first criterion is used for progressive failure.
The material will not heal; the damaged elements keep the degraded properties after unloading.
Model 1 – Selective Gradual Degradation
This model uses a selective degradation of the moduli depending on failure mode. The moduli are decreased
gradually when failure occurs. Within an increment, it attempts to keep the highest failure index less than or
equal to one. Whenever a failure index F larger than one occurs, stiffness reduction factors ri are calculated
based upon the value of the failure indices. The incremental contribution to the total reduction factor is
calculated as
(6-10)
This is done differently for different failure criteria as described below. Six such reduction factors are stored
and updated. They are then used for scaling the respective material modulus according to
(6-11)
(6-12)
(6-13)
(6-14)
(6-15)
(6-16)
The Poisson’s ratios are scaled in the same way as the corresponding shear modulus.
For the maximum stress and maximum strain criteria the reduction factors are calculated separately from
each separate failure index: r1 is calculated from the first failure index as given by equation 6-11 above, r2 is
calculated from the second failure index from equation 6-12 etc. Thus, there is no coupling of the different
failure modes for these criteria.
Model 2 – Selective Immediate Degradation
This model uses selective degradation just as Model 1, but the stiffness is abruptly decreased. As soon as
failure is indicated, the stiffnesses are set to a1 – the residual stiffness factor. The same rules as in Model 1 for
how the different factors are defined depending on the type of failure is applied here.
The different options are flagged through the MATF  bulk data entry.ri1e1F––  –=

Main Index
Introduction to Contact
The analysis of a finite element model (FEM) with contact bodies, interacting with each other is called
contact analysis. It is the analysis of contact bodies (deformable or rigid) interacting with each other. Many
engineering problems involve contact between two or more components. In these problems a force normal
to the contacting surfaces acts on the two bodies when they touch each other. If there is friction between the
surfaces, shear forces may be created that resist the tangential motion (sliding) of the bodies. The aim of
contact simulations is to identify the areas on the surfaces that are in contact and to calculate the contact
pressures generated.
Contact can be a useful tool when performing FEA simulations. It allows the interaction between multiple
bodies without adding additional elements to the model. By adding the contact condition to a model
correctly it is possible to create a model that more realistically represents reality. However, by adding contact
to a model, it might cause the analysis not to complete because of the added computational complexity and
the number of things the analyst has to take into account.
In a finite element analysis (FEA), contact conditions are a special class of discontinuous constraint, allowing
forces to be transmitted from one part of the model to another. The constraint is discontinuous because it is
applied only when the two surfaces are in contact. When the two surfaces separate, no constraint is applied.
The analysis has to be able to detect when two surfaces are in contact and apply the contact constraints
accordingly. Similarly, the analysis must be able to detect when two surfaces separate and remove the contact
constraints.
By default, MSC Nastran does not assume contact exist between all bodies in a model, simply because of the
computation cost involved in checking for contact between every element and every other element in a
model. This can however be specified, at the expense of the run times, but another reason why this is not
specified by default is because different contact conditions such as varying friction values might exist
throughout the model and therefore the analyst needs a means to specify and control it.
Contact in a model is applied mathematically and unless otherwise specified, MSC Nastran defaults will be
used that are suitable for general contact cases. Default parameters will in most cases be sufficient, however,
it might cause problems under more complex or less common scenarios, or induce unnecessarily longer
solving times if the analyst doesn’t understand these parameters and set them incorrectly.
Contact can be deformable-deformable or rigid-deformable.
Contact Types
T wo types of contact interaction exist between two bodies namely glue and touch  contact. Although there are
variations in how these contact interactions are applied depending on the software used, these remain the two
main contact interactions.
Touching Contact : In this case, both glue and touching contact can be separate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;119 CHAPTER 7
Contact
Main Index
Glued Contact:  In this case, the bodies are glued together
The difference between glue and touching is glue contact does not allow sliding, but touching does.
Touching Contact
In touching contact bodies can separate
Touch contact is a valuable tool to use in FEA models although it comes with the cost of a much
longer analysis time and it does require additional considerations to ensure that the model solves
successfully.
With this method of contact, the parts in the model can move as it is allowed to by the constraints
on the body, however with touch contact active between two bodies the additional condition is that
the one body is not allowed to penetrate the other. With the movement of the body allowed it is
therefore important to consider the position of one body relative to another.
Glued Contact
Glue contact is an ideal option to use in a model with multiple parts in a structure. It allows two bodies to
be fixed at the contact surface without having the elements of both bodies be the same size and attempting
to have the nodes on the two surfaces match.
It can be applied as a linear contact which means that two element faces remain in contact no matter what
happens with the structure around it. As long as the contact condition is detected between two bodies, this
will not cause for a longer analysis time and it should not cause further struggle with the model.
Glue contact can also be applied with certain conditions. For instance, it can be specified that if the stress on
the contact surface exceeds a specified stress, the contact should be released and for the remainder of the
analysis be treated as a broken contact.
MSC Nastran internally generates MPC equations to represent the glued contact . MPCs are generated by
MSC Nastran internally to represent the glued contact . The MPCs generated to model glued contact can be
written during the analysis in a punch ( *.pch ) file. You can also request for the MPC equations be output
to a punch file so that the you can visualize what is glued and what is not by plotting MPCs.
These MPCs can then be directly imported into the Patran database to provide a visual reference to the glued
contact . The MPC punch file is created with the following Case Control Command:Full Contact No separation, no sliding
SOL 400 calls it Permanent Glue Contact
Sliding contact No separation, sliding
SOL 400 does not have it
Breaking contact Full, but may separate if force/stress &amp;gt; threshold
Linear contact Glued elastic stiffness&lt;/p&gt;

Permanent Glue Contact
This is a special case of contact, where the initial configuration is used to determine  the contact constraint,
and these contact constraint should n ot change throughout the analysis. I t is designed to help users quickly
assemble components with dissimilar meshes. Nodes or segments which are  not initially in contact do not
come into contact, and in fact may penetrate the model. The constraint is a glue type,  meaning there will be
no relative normal or tangential displacement. The bodies will never separate.
Permanent glued is designed to help users:
To quickly assemble components with dissimilar meshes and connect  dissimilar meshes
Help in simple assembly modeling when no other contact occurs.
It is applicable to SOL 101, 103, 105,  107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, SOL 200, and SOL 400. Permanent
glued contact is activated if the BCTABLE  or BCTABL1  that is referenced in the first Loadcase (SOL 100*) or
in the first Step (SOL 200) has a value of IGLUE greater than zero for all contact body pairs.
If you require conventional (general) contact for the complete simulation, but permanent glued contact is&lt;br&gt;
invoked, enter bulk data BCPARA,0,NLGLUE,1  to deactivate the permanent glue in a subsequent step.&lt;br&gt;
Because glued contact is very useful in assembly modeling problems encountered in engineering practice,
several  special cases are considered as well.
Some characteristics of the permanent glue contact are as follows:
It should not be used in models that experience large rotations.
Bodies should be in contact initially since contact detection is performed only in the beginning of
the analysis
A linear solution. Permanent contact constraint MPC equations are used. No nonlinear increments
or iterations involved
Step Glue Contact
Step glued contact is available only for SOL 400. Step Glued contact is activated using a value a negative
value of  IGLUE  for each contact pair. It is similar to Glued Contact, there are two conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;121 CHAPTER 7
Contact
Main Index
The contact status is checked at the beginning of the step, and those nodes or segments that are in
contact will  remain in glued contact for the entire step. The constraints will change due to large
rotations.
Furthermore, if a  large tensile force or stress developed over the interface in the current loadcase, no
separation would occur for  these regions which are initially in contact. Performing an unglue of
breaking glue would also not be enforced  during the step for these regions. This may be successfully
used to model the union of dissimilar meshes, where  at a later time one wanted to separate the
bodies (e.g., opening of a door).
When using step glue conventional contact occurs for the nodes/segments of the body which are not
in contact  at the beginning of the step. That means when they come into contact, they will glue, but
they may separate  within the same step
General Glue Contact
Two bodies may come into contact and separate at any point in the simulation, but when in contact,  there
is no relative sliding. The fundamental constraint is no relative normal displacement or tangential
displacement  when bodies are in contact. General contact is available only in SOL 101, SOL 400  and SOL
700.
One can consider this equivalent to two surfaces that have infinite friction. The  word glued  only refers to the
constraint on the tangential behavior. Bodied that are in glued contact may lose contact  if the separation
(force or stress based) separation criteria is exceeded, due to unglue or breaking glue.
Some characteristics of the general glue contact are as follows:
Simulates a glued joint
Initially, the bodies do not have to be in contact. They can come in contact during the analysis and
become glued
After being glued together, the bodies can separate again or stay glued based on user specified
criteria uch as breaking glued contact
Just like touching contact, the general glued contact utilizes the nonlinear solver which is an
incremental and iterative process
Because contact status can change during the analysis in general glued contact, it is an incremental
and iterative process.
Separation force is infinite FNTOL = 1E20
Breaking Glue Contact
In engineering problems that involve delamination, it is often useful to indicate that two surfaces are glued
together,  but may separate if a certain stress level is reached. The simplest is based upon a normal stress
(preferred) or a force  condition. For problems like tape peeling, it is useful to include both the normal and
shear stress condition. This can  be invoked by JGLUE on BCTABLE  or BCONPRG :
0: glued contact nodes will stay in contact. Default.
1: to invoke the standard separation behavior
2: breaking glued with a breaking criterion&lt;/p&gt;

Summary of Glue Contact
In summary, the glue condition between bodies can be defined via BCTABLE or BCONPRG through the
IGLUE  keyword as follows:
In SOLs 101 and 400, if contact is initially not true set NLGLUE on BCPARA  to 1. For SOL 400 with a
mixture of glued and non-glued bodies, BCPARA,0,NLGLUE,1  must also be used
Cohesive Contact
This is a special case of glued contact. In the modern industries, the product structure like  airplane,
automobile, and so on, is becoming more and more complicated with many parts. The assembly process may&lt;br&gt;
be done through a variety of processes such as rivets, bolts, spot weld, seam welds, or adhesives. In the
numerical  simulations of the assemblies of many parts into a single structure, it is often too costly to model
each one of these  discrete connectors, and the glued contact capability provides an effective and efficient way
to simplify and reduce the  computation costs.
While this method is easy to use, however, it often results in too stiff of a structure because  effectively the
connection is rigid. To alleviate this, a flexible glued contact capability is available. With cohesive glued  IGLUE Keyword Description
0 No gluing
1 Activates the glue option. In the glue option, all degrees-of- freedom of the
contact nodes are tied in case  of deformable-deformable contact once the node
comes in contact. The relative tangential motion of a contact  node is zero in case
of deformable-rigid contact. The node will be projected onto the contact body.
2 Activates a special glue option to insure that there is no relative tangential and
normal displacement when  a node comes into contact. An existing initial gap or
overlap between the node and the contacted body will not  be removed, as the
node will not be projected onto the contacted body. T o maintain an initial gap,
ERROR  should be set to a value slightly larger than the physical gap.
3 Ensures full moment carrying glue when shells contact. The node will be
projected onto the contacted  body.
4 Insures full moment carrying glue when shells contact. The node will not be
projected onto the contact  body and an existing initial gap or overlap between the
node and the contacted body will not be removed, as  the node will not be
projected onto the contacted body.&lt;/p&gt;

Contact
Main Index
contact, it is necessary to model the detailed connectors but provides the stiffness of the connectors in the
glued contact.
There are many cases in which parts are connected using either discrete entities, such as rivets or bolts, or a
spot or seam weld. It is often too expensive to model these discrete entities so the glued approach is often
used to model these connections. While easy to use, this method is effectively a rigid connection and results
in behavior that is too stiff.
To compensate for this undesirable behavior, instead of entering a non-default constant penalty factor for the
segment-to-segment contact algorithm, you can use cohesive contact. It allows you to apply a separate finite
stiffness in the normal and tangential directions.
The advantages of cohesive contact are:
Provides a user controllable soft contact mechanism
Reduces computational costs and improves accuracy of assembly analyses
Simplifies analysis of bonded Joints: Replace detailed model with simplified model
Implemented for small sliding segment to segment contact
User specifies either stiffness or contact stress vs. relative displacement on contact interaction menu.
Contact Definition Method
Before discussing contact in MSC Nastran it should be noted that there are two possible methods of
specifying contact in MSC Nastran. The two contact methods are:
Contact table method ( BCTABLE ): With this method of specifying contact, it is difficult to define
the contact interactions between many bodies in the contact table without making any mistakes.
Hence, a new method (contact pairs method) was introduced
Contact pairs method: In this method, the contact pairs can be created directly and instead of
specifying contact parameters for each pair, contact interaction can be defined and simply
referenced for each pair. This makes it easier to define the contact condition for a large amount of
contact bodies.
The following figure shows the process of defining contact with both the contact table method as well as the
contact pairs method.&lt;/p&gt;

Both methods of applying contact will have the same outcome but with the contact table it is easier to define
contact for a small number of contact bodies, whereas the contact pairs method will be easier to define contact
for a large number of contact bodies.
Both methods have their own merits. Any one of the two methods can be used for any model although it is
recommended to use the contact table for a model with a small number of contact bodies and contact pairs
for a model with a large number of contact bodies. Contact can be deformable-deformable or rigid-
deformable .
Contact Bodies
These types of contact can be applied between various types of bodies in various combinations. Contact
bodies can be created from:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;125 CHAPTER 7
Contact
Main Index
Deformable body : It is defined by element IDs or element properties
Rigid body : It is defined by geometry (curves and surfaces) or 4-node patches
Deformable Contact Bodies (3D/2D/1D)
A deformable contact body is a normal FEM body that can deform and experience stresses while in and due
to contact. For any deformable contact body with a non-square shape or a shape that is not exactly captures
by the elements, analytical edge discontinuities can be activated when creating the contact body. Analytical
edge discontinuities is a function that Nastran uses to determine the possible true curvatures of the edge that
could not be captured accurately by the elements and uses this shape when determining contact.
An example of this is two circular objects in contact. Since the circular objects will consist of a number of
straight lines or faces it is difficult to have an accurate distributions of the forces acting between the two
bodies. The contact might be applied only to some of the faces or have inconsistencies in the contact forces.
Although this might affect the results somewhat, this will also make it difficult for Nastran to correctly detect
the contact or fail to detect the contact at all. With analytical edge discontinuities Nastran uses the change
in angle between the two element faces to construct a closer to circular contact surface.&lt;/p&gt;

Rigid Contact Bodies (3D/2D)
A rigid contact body is a useful method in which the body is assumed to remain rigid during the simulation
which means no calculations are performed for the inside of the body. This means you can have a body in the
analysis which affects the rest of the structure without adding significant time to the analysis.
Rigid bodies can be modeled with geometry or finite elements
•Curves for 2D contact ( NURBS2D ): allows for 3 DOF: UX, UY, and ROTZ
•Surfaces for 3D contact ( NURBS ): allows for 6 DOF: UX, UY, UZ, ROTX, ROTY, and ROTZ
•2D elements ( PATCH3D ), 3/4-node patches
•It is recommended to use Bezier or NURBs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;129 CHAPTER 7
Contact
Main Index
•Continuity of the normal vector along the surface
•A mathematical description
•Robustness of the Contact Algorithm
It can be velocity/position/load driven
It can change shape (growth factor)
It can have initial velocity to save CPU at start of analysis and touch deformable bodies
The rigid contact body is applied to add the required stiffness to the model without adding additional solving
time. Since a rigid body is simply geometry that is specified as a body, there are no nodes on the body to
either constrain or apply a load to that body.
For rigid contact bodies the approach velocity function is available to assist the initial contact to be detected
in the model. With this a direction is specified for which Nastran will move the rigid body in this direction
until contact between rigid and deformable bodies are detected before a load is applied, thereby ensuring that
the contact condition is met at the start of the analysis.
When creating a rigid contact body, it is important to check the inward normals of the contact body. This
will show an arrow that points in the direction of the solid part of the rigid body and it is therefore very
important that the arrow points in the correct direction.

•Bilinear shear friction
Two type of contact behavior

Defining Contact Interactions
When defining the contact interaction between two contact bodies, whether with a contact table or contact
pairs, some contact properties can be selected to help with the contact detection.Linear: SOL101 3D analysis only
Small deflection theory
Sliding neglected
All aspects of the simulation are ‘linear’ with the exception
structural contact
Glued
SOL101/103/105/108/109/11
1/112Permanent Glued Contact is a special case of glued contact
Primarily used to join 2 dissimilar meshes
Contact must initially be true (bodies should be in contact
initially)
When edges or grids are to be glued, gluing can also be done for
the rotational DOFs (Moment Carrying Glue)
Permanent contact constraint MPC equations are used.  No
nonlinear increments or iterations involved.
Nonlinear: SOL 400 Touch/glue
Large displacement: allows sliding between element edges/faces
Large deformation
2D (axi, plane stress/strain), 3D analysis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran: SOL 400 Getting Started Manual
Contact Settings for a SOL400 Analysis132
Main Index
Primary and secondary o ption flag: It is a tool that specifies where the contact is applied to. In this
option select the A=1 for all 3D contact bodies, which will specify that contact should occur on the
outside surface of the contact body, whereas for 1D and 2D contact bodies some other options are
available. These include options such as which side of a shell element should be in contact or
whether the edges of a 1D element should be included.
Coordinate modification: It is a useful tool that will allow MSC Nastran to move nodes (within a
tolerance distance) to avoid some contact problems that might occur. Two options are available here
with the combination of both options available as the third.
In the case of stress free initial contact, nodes are moved in the beginning of the analysis to ensure that the
analysis will start with the nodes in contact. For this option, the nodes will be moved if either the nodes are
already penetrating the contact bodies or a small gap is exist between the two bodies. The nodes will then be
moved (within the tolerance distance) until the nodes are aligned.
Contact Settings for a SOL400 Analysis
When creating a SOL400 analysis, under the solver control settings or in the BCPARA  Nastran entry, the types
of contact detection specified with MSC Nastran are:
 Node-to-segment contact
Segment-to-segment
Node-to-segment (NTS) Contact
Node-to-segment (N2S or NODESURF ) contact is the default contact detection type specified with MSC
Nastran. It uses the paradigm of a secondary n ode interacting with a primary p atch—that is, it works on a
primary-secondary b asis with one body being defined as the primary a nd the other as the secondary.
This is a mature capability, but has some limitations
Continuous displacement fields, but discontinuous stress (pressure) fields (limited using analytical
contact body definition)
Available for standard linear contact
The rule for the contact is that the nodes of the secondary  body cannot penetrate the element faces
of the primary b ody.
Limitations with Node-to-Segment Contact
A common problem is that for a large difference in element size an incorrect primary-secondary c onfiguration
is selected which will mean that nodes from the primary w ill penetrate the secondary b ody and cause incorrect
contact results since the contact rule has not been broken. So, important to always choose the body with the
smaller element size to be the secondary b ody. In cases where this might still be a problem, there is the option
to select double sided contact. This means that both bodies will be checked for contact to avoid this problem.
This will the result in the contact condition will be checked twice per calculated increment increasing the
analysis time significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;133 CHAPTER 7
Contact
Main Index
Segment-to-Segment (STS) contact
The segment-to-segment (S2S or SEGTOSEG ) contact detection method results in easier contact detection.
The primary-secondary c oncept does not exist with this method and both bodies are checked for contact.
This method adds additional points to the element face. It also checks the contact between these point and
thus allows for a larger difference in element size on the contact surface.
It is the new method of contact and is also the preferred method.
It uses contact segments defined on both sides of the contact interaction
The primary-secondary  notion disappears
Better precision in the contact displacement and stress fields
The preferred method for future evolution
Not available with all functionality (e.g. enhanced linear contact with LINCNT )
For models such as these the large displacements option ( LGDISP  Nastran entry) should be used along with
the contact condition.The large-sliding option can be used for any model with large or small-sliding while
the contact main input
With segment-to-segment contact comes two options:
Small-sliding segment-to-segment:  For models where the contact bodies do not move relative to
each other, such as the bending of a plate around a cylinder the small-sliding option is sufficient
since the same elements will be in contact during the analysis. Small-sliding option will only be
sufficient for a model with small-sliding contact.
Large-sliding segment-to-segment contact:  For a model with large relative movement between
elements in contact, such as in roller bending, the elements in contact have to be redefined for every
increment and therefore the large-sliding option has to be used. Contact bodies BCBODY1

Contact Considerations134
Main Index
Contact Considerations
When running an analysis that contains contact, whether it is glue or touch contact, there are certain
considerations to be made for the model itself in order to ensure that the contact condition is applied
correctly.
Always start by using a small version of the model in order to test whether the model is set up
correctly. This applies to models with contact especially since touch contact will significantly
increase the solving time, which will result in an unnecessary loss of time if an analysis fails or
produces incorrect results due to an error with the contact condition.
Although it is theoretically possible to have elements on the contact surface that vary greatly in size,
this is not always the case. Some errors have been found in detecting the contact correctly when the
size of the element faces on the contact surface varied too greatly.
This is because you are trying to have contact between one surface with element on the other surface.
For example: fifty contact points with another surface with only five. Although you can find the
contact, it is possible to miss a few of elements when checking the contact. The different sizes of
elements can be further evaluated to find the required element size for the contact surface. However
a good starting point is to have a maximum of five elements on one surface in contact with one
element on the other surface.
A possible way to decrease the size of the elements on the contact surface without increasing the total
amount of elements significantly is to separate the section in contact from the rest of the body and
only increase the amount of elements in that section and apply self-contact to that body. This will
allow the element size to gradually reduce from the one body to the next across the contact surface.
When working with load controller rigid contact bodies, especially with geometries such as a wheel,
it is important to remember that the body will be treated as rigid and therefore the contact surface
will not increase due to deformation. In such cases the deformable contact body might require even
smaller element faces on the contact surface to ensure that the contact condition is detected correctly
and a penetration condition for the rigid body into the deformable body is avoided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;135 CHAPTER 7
Contact
Main Index
Another case is when applying a linear motion to a rigid body for a model where the rigid body is
moved over a deformable body and a load being applied at each step after the body is moved. In
order to select an appropriate distance to move in each step (by choosing the step size) it is
important to select a distance small enough that the rigid body does not move into the deformable
body due to the deformation of the deformable body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although having smaller time steps will increase the number of steps to solve for and therefore
increase the total analysis time, having too large steps will either cause the analysis to fail or have an
even longer analysis time in order to solve the penetration condition. It is therefore important to
choose a number of steps for the analysis by considering the distance that the rigid body will move
in each step as well as the size of the elements on the contact face.
Applying contact to a model correctly can therefore allow you to decrease the analysis time by reducing the
total amount of elements. Alternatively it is possible to create a more realistic model by including a realistic
interaction between bodies in your model.

Introduction
This chapter describes the procedures for applying loads and constraints which can be used in SOL 400
models. Each type of load or constraint is described on how it is used in finite element modeling and in the
MSC Nastran input. Further information on how the various types of loads and constraints are used can be
found in standard finite element text books, and further information on the MSC Nastran input format can
be found in the MSC Nastran Quick Reference Guide .
Constraints
In static analysis, the rigid body modes must be restrained in order to eliminate singularity of the stiffness
matrix. The required constraints may be supplied with single point constraints, multipoint constraints, or
free body supports. If free body supports are used, the rigid body characteristics will be calculated and checked
for the sufficiency of the supports.
Boundary conditions are imposed in the form of constraints on selected degrees of freedom on the model.
Several degrees of freedom (at least six) are constrained to ground using either SPC bulk data entries or the
PS field of the GRID  entry.
Other than single-point constraints, MSC Nastran provides a method for creating linear constraint
relationships between several degrees of freedom known as multiple-point constraints or MPCs.
Single-Point Constraints (SPC and SPC1)
A Single- Point Constraint (SPC) is a constraint that is applied to a single degree of freedom, which can either
be a component of motion at a grid point or the displacement of a scalar point.
The primary applications for single-point constraints are as follows:
To constrain a structure.
To remove degrees of freedom that are not used in the structural analysis (i.e., are not connected to
any structural elements or otherwise joined to the structure).
To remove degrees of freedom that are very weak and coupled to the structure. For example, this
condition can arise in rotation about an axis of a slightly curved shell. In this case, a judgment must
be made whether to remove the degree of freedom using an SPC (in which case the structure may be
over-constrained), or to leave it in the problem (in which case the stiffness matrix is nearly singular).
When you apply a single-point constraint to remove a singularity, it is not required for the restrained
component of motion to be aligned exactly with the singular direction of motion (however, it is highly
recommended). Consider the pair of colinear pin-connected rods, shown in Figure 8-1, that permit
unrestrained motion at point G in any direction perpendicular to the axis of the rods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;139 CHAPTER 8
Constraints
Main Index
Figure 8-1  Pin-Connected Rods
Enforced Motion Constraints (SPCD and SPCR)
An enforced motion constraint is used to apply a prescribed motion at a grid point, which may be either a
component of motion at a grid point or the displacement of a scalar point. SPCD  and SPCR  define an
enforced displacement value for static analysis and an enforced displacement, velocity or acceleration in
dynamic analysis. SPCD  provides the final total displacement, velocity, or acceleration at the end of the
current loadcase, and SPCR  determines the incremental displacement, velocity, or acceleration during the
current loadcase, relative to the value of the previous loadcase.  For details on SPCD  and SPCR  refer to MSC
Nastran Nonlinear (SOL400) User’s guide .
Applying Constraints
Once you have designed a model, constraints are added that forces selected portions of your model to remain
fixed or to move by a specified value. These constraints can be either:
Single Point Constraints
Multipoint Constraints
Single Point Constraint
A Single Point Constraint (SPC) is constraint on a single degree of freedom. It assigns a zero or nonzero value
to a single degree of freedom. It can be expressed as:
i = u (8-1)
where  u is the value of the prescribed displacement on the degree of freedom i. The case of u = 0 is the most
common case, and is often used as a boundary condition, to “fix” or “ground” the movement of a point in a
certain direction.CROD 1
CROD 2xny
G&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran: SOL 400 Getting Started Manual
Multipoint Constraints (MPC)140
Main Index
Since the value of i is known, one could, in principle, eliminate the specified degree of freedom from the
other degrees of freedom to be solved for as unknowns. This would reduce the size of the system of equations
to be solved, but on the other hand it would take time to perform the elimination, and this approach adds
complexity to the code.
SOL 400 uses a different technique. A number which is large compared to the stiffness coefficients (say, for
discussion, 1020) is added to the diagonal term K11 of the equation for the degree of freedom to be
constrained. Also, if the degree of freedom is to be constrained to a nonzero value u, then u  1020 is added
to the right hand side of the modified equation. This modified equation is now:
Ki11 + &amp;hellip; + (Kii)1020i + &amp;hellip; Kinn = Fi + (u 1020) (8-2)
Assuming all Kij to be small with respect to 1020, the solution of the system of equations is obtained with
negligible error.
The modified system of equations remain well conditioned. The value used by SOL 400 for the large number
is 1010 times the largest stiffness coefficient found on the diagonal of the stiffness matrix.
Multipoint Constraints (MPC)
The multipoint constraint, or MPC entry, provides the capability to model rigid bodies and to represent other
relationships which can be treated as rigid constraints. The MPC entry provides considerable generality but
lacks user convenience. Specifically, the user must supply all the coefficients in the equations of constraint
defined through the MPC entry.
To enhance user convenience, nine rigid body elements are available in MSC Nastran. See Table 8-1. These
elements require the specification of the degrees of freedom that are involved in the equations of constraint.
All the coefficients in these equations of constraint are calculated in MSC Nastran.

Static Loads
A load is applied to the model only if it is specifically called out in the case control section. If you forget to
request any load in the case control section, the problem will be solved with zero loads applied. There are no
error or warning messages indicating that there is no load being applied. Forgetting to specify a load request
in the case control section can be a common mistake many new users make. An indication of this problem
is when all of the displacements and stresses come out to be zero.

CWELD/CFAST/CSEAM Element Enhancements
The CWELD /CFAST elements have been changed so that there is now a consistent formulation between
linear and SOL 400 nonlinear analysis. Additionally, the CSEAM element is now supported in SOL 400 and
has a consistent formulation between linear and SOL 400 nonlinear analysis.
Benefits
The CWELD/CFAST  elements provide the same element output formats in both linear and SOL 400
nonlinear solutions.
In the CFAST/CSEAM/CWELD  analysis, the auxiliary points generated are in the solution set.
The CWELD/CFAST algorithm has been improved to find the Best Possible Projection with zero
projection tolerance improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;143 CHAPTER 8
Constraints
Main Index
The improved CWELD  with options PARTPAT  and ELPAT , and CFAST  elements do not move GA and
GB if both are supplied by the user, thus maintaining user mesh integrity.
The 3x3 mesh limitation has been removed for the CWELD  with options PARTPAT  and ELPAT  and the
CFAST  elements.
There are no required changes in the user element input description of the CFAST/CSEAM/CWELD&lt;br&gt;
elements.
The CFAST/CWELD/CBUSH  provides nonlinear force output for SOL 400 ANALYSIS=NLTRAN .
MPC force output is available for the connector element constraints.
Besides global search algorithm control there is now local connector element connectivity control
via the new CONCTL  bulk data entry.
A brief summary of connector projection results is output in the F06 file for each connector type.
A new SWLDPRM , CSVOUT , UNITNUM  entry will produce a comma separated file useful for reports.
The CSEAM  and CWELD (not by default) can now contribute mass to the structure.
Description of Features
Details of the improved CWELD/CFAST  algorithm are described below.
Formulation Changes
In the new consistent formulation for the CWELD/CFAST  elements for linear analysis, RBE3 elements are
written internally, and the auxiliary points are in the solution set and both are identifiable by the
SWLDPRM, PRTSW entry.
The auxiliary grids generated start with GRID ID 101000001. There are always four auxiliary grids for
patch A and four auxiliary grids for patch B.
The RBE3 elements generated start with 100001002. An RBE3 is generated for each auxiliary point
for each patch A and B tying each patch grid to that auxiliary point. There is a RBE3 generated for
GA tying GA to its patch auxiliary points and a RBE3 generated for GB tying GB to its patch auxiliary
points.
Both linear and nonlinear output is consistent.
The new consistent CWELD/CFAST  is selected by default. The old CWELD/CFAST  can be actuated by using the
PARAM , OLDWELD , YES entry.
It has been determined in testing that the above formulation changes produce little or no change in solution
results when comparing the old CWELD/CFAST  against the new CWELD/CFAST  results.
Enhanced Search Algorithm
For the new connector logic, the search algorithm has been enhanced based on user inputs in an attempt to
achieve the best possible connections. The new search tolerance starts with a zero projection tolerance. This
may result in changes from the previous connector results using the old CWELD/CFAST elements.
The list below gives a brief summary of the highlights of the improved CWELD/CFAST  algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

1.For the CFAST  and the CWELD  with options PARTPAT  and ELPAT , grids GA and GB internally keep the
user-specified IDs and the user-specified locations. This change was primarily introduced because
many users complained that the location of GA and GB represented their modeling procedures and
desired mesh locations.
2.For the CWELD  with ELEMID/GRIDID  option, grids GA and GB internally keep the user-specified IDs
and the user-specified locations, but in the case when GA and GB are associated with shell patches, a
duplicate internal grid is generated to avoid singularity of the generated RBE3.

using a RBE3 element. This causes a set conflict which is avoided by generating an internal grid.
3.For two stacked connectors having a common patch with a common grid, the program checks
duplicated GA/GB and only a single RBE3 is generated for the common patch.

4.If the user specifies both grids GA and GB, for the CFAST  and the CWELD  with options PARTPAT  and
ELPAT , the SWLDPRM , GSMOVE  entry is nonfunctional.
In the CFAST  and the CWELD  with options PARTPAT  and ELPAT , if the user specifies both GA and GB
they will not be moved. This may cause the CFAST /CWELD search algorithm to fail for some welds
that had passed under the old CWELD /CFAST  search algorithm. If this occurs, the user can do one of
four things:
a.Determine a better location for GA and GB of the failing welds so that they may project.
b.Remove GA and GB from the CWELD /CFAST  entry and replace with a GS entry allowing the
CWELD /CFAST  algorithm to move and project and generate internal GA and GB locations.
c.Use SWLDPRM , MOVGAB , 1 to generate internal GA and GB grids at the corrected locations for all
CWELD /CFAST . The locations of the original user specified GA and GB are unchanged.
d.Use the new CONCTL Bulk Data entry with SWLDPRM , MOVGAB , 1&amp;quot; to allow local control of
specific welds to correct the locations of grids GA and GB.
CONCTL, 83, , MOVGAB, 1
Where: SET3, 83, ELEM, 1345, 2678
5.The maximum tolerance for SWLDPRM , PROJTOL  has been relaxed.
a.Regardless of the value of SWLDPRM PROJTOL , the algorithm starts by assuming a zero projection
tolerance for the projections of GA/GB for the CWELD  option PARTPAT  or the CFAST  option
PROP  and for GAHi/GBHi for the CWELD  options PARTPAT  and ELPAT  and any CFAST  option.
b.The tolerance is increased by 0.02 until a projection is found or the PROJTOL  value is reached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;145 CHAPTER 8

c.This can be turned off while computing the auxiliary grid projection onto EIDA/EIDB  by setting
PROJTOL= - value where 0.0 . value . 1.0. In this case, the projection calculation starts at tolerance
= PROJTOL |. For the rest of the projection search, the algorithm reverts back to (a) and (b) above.
6.A brief Connector Summary of projection results is always output in the f06 file for each connector
type: FST-ELEM, WLD-PARTPAT, WLD-ELEMID , etc.
7.For linear connectors, MPCFORCE  output is available. In nonlinear SOL 400, the RBE3 elements
generated become Lagrange elements if the default RIGID=LAGRANGE  is used and are no longer in
the MPC set; hence, there will be NO MPCFORCE  output for RIGID=LAGRANGE .
CWELD  will not contribute to MASS  by default even if its associated MATi entry has a nonzero
density. T o react to a nonzero density SWLDPARM,WMASS,1  is required. If mass is computed, the
PARAM,COUPMASS  effects the mass calculation.
8. In the improved CFAST  and CWELD , GA and GB are not moved and internal coincident grids are
not generated at a new location; thus, two additional restrictions are required.
a.There can be no user-supplied constraints on GA and GB. A fatal message will be issued if there
are any.
b.The CWELD  length must be &amp;gt; 10-6. The point to patch option defined by ELEMID  or GRIDID  will,
however, still create a new GS internally to obtain a minimum required length; i.e., LDMIN  .
length/D . LDMAX. For the point-to-patch connection, GS is used as GB. The algorithm will
use the new GS as GB but keep the user-supplied GS unchanged. Since the point-to-patch is
often used to tack two shell corners, the default LDMIN  may cause the connector to be unstable.
To avoid this, it is recommended that the user set LDMIN=1.E-6  on the appropriate PWELD  entry.
9.CFAST  and the CWELD  with options PARTPAT  and ELPAT  with the improved formulation has
removed the restriction that a connector patch cannot span more than three elements. It will now
span over a patch of as many elements that the value of diameter D of the patch encloses and for
which projections can be found.
The following Figure, all element grids contained in the green circle region of say patch A will be
used in a RBE3 connection in addition to the RBE3 connections generated for the four auxiliary
points. The example for this figure can be found at /tpl/connectr14/cei_103.dat.&lt;br&gt;
The CWELD  ELEMID  option still only connects by design two elements. The diameter is only used to
compute the beam stiffness.
The green circle passes through the four auxiliary points of the patch (the nine digit grid IDs.). The
user-specified diameter D on the PWELD  and PFAST  entries determine the locations of the four
auxiliary points. The green circle diameter is approximately 1.253D. The element grids shown
outside the green circle belong only to the respective auxiliary points.
For higher-order shell elements CQUAD8  or CTRIA6  with no missing midside nodes, the RBE3&lt;br&gt;
relationships use only the midside nodes. If one or more midside node is missing, then the corner
nodes are used.
The diameter D on the PFAST/PWELD  entry is used to determine the projection location of these
auxiliary points as well as the stiffness properties of the patch to patch connection.&lt;/p&gt;

contains the projected auxiliary point.

because they are included in their associated auxiliary point RBE3 elements 100001026 because they

10. The CWELD/CFAST/CBUSH  has the additional enhancement that for nonlinear transient SOL 400
with ANALYSIS=NLTRAN  they will request Element FORCE output for the CWELD/CFAST/CBUSH&lt;br&gt;
elements. FORCE=ALL  will request force output for all CWELD/CFAST/CBUSH  elements. Element
FORCE  output in SOL 400 nonlinear transient analysis is unique to  CWELD/CFAST/CBUSH  elements.
Other elements will not list force output in SOL 400 nonlinear transient.
If in a SOL 400 nonlinear transient, you have FORCE=ALL  and carry this over to say an

Additional Information
1.In SOL 400, for ANALYSIS=NLSTAT  or ANALYSIS=NLTRAN , the generated RBE3 constraints
become Lagrange elements and may undergo large rotation. For ANALYSIS=NLTRAN  with initial
conditions (IC=n) in case control that cause large initial stresses in the structure at time t=0, the case
control entry RIGID needs to have the value RIGID=LINEAR  to insure convergence.
2.For user desiring to postprocess the CFAST/CSEAM/CWELD  connectors with their own methods, the
following is useful:
a.The GEOM2 table contains, after module MODGM2 , a record ELCORR  that correlates the
CFAST/CSEAM/CWELD  and its associated RBE3 elements. Also, this module will, for linear
analysis and for nonlinear SOL 400 analysis run with RIGID=LINEAR , place the internal
generated RBE3  into the GEOM4  table.
b.In SOL 400 with RIGID=LAGRANGE  (Default), internally generated RBE3 elements go into the
GEOM2 (as do all other user specified rigid elements) not the GEOM4 table.
c.The CWELD/CFAST/CBUSH  force output for ANALYSIS=NLTRAN  in SOL 400 is OP2 file
output on OEFNLXX data block. If SCR=POST  is run, then this force data is also written to the
data base file OEFNL3  and op2 file OEFNL.op2  is also written.
3.The DISPLACEMENT (CONNECTOR=)  Case Control Command works in the same fashion for both
the old connector formulation and the new connector formulation.
For the CFAST  with option ELEM  and the CWELD  with option ELPAT , the shell elements connected
on each patch must have same property identification number of PSHELL entry.
If parameter OSWPPT  is used to specify the offset for internally generated grid IDs, its value should
be greater than the maximum identification number of GRID entries to avoid conflict IDs.
Connector Stiffness
Connector contribution to a structural model&amp;rsquo;s overall stiffness is sensitive to the models mesh size and the
orientation of the connector relative to the mesh. Thus, the discretization process itself may cause, for
example, a model using a fine mesh to be stiffer in torsion than a corresponding model using a coarse mesh.
For production models that correlate well with test, refining the mesh may cause an inherent overall loss of
stiffness due to mesh refinement and hence loss of correlation.
To allow you some control over stiffness, improved connectors ( CWELD  with ELPAT  or PARTPAT  or CFAST )
are provided with two options to provide additional connector stiffness. The two options may be used
individually or in combination.&lt;/p&gt;

CWELD/CFAST/CSEAM Element Enhancements148
Main Index
A disadvantage of this method is that as DRATIO  is increased using the global command SWLDPRM , DRATIO ,
value. So, some connector elements may begin to fail because they may no longer be able to find a patch
projection. To overcome this, the SWLDPRM, NREDIA , can be increased to a value as high as 8 to allow failing
welds to halve their patch diameters up to eight times.
If the SWLDPRM, NREDIA  is not an approach the user wishes to pursue, then for these failing elements, the
bulk data entry CONCTL, SETID, ,DRATIO , value can be used to define a set for failing connectors and
set a value of DRATIO  for these connectors that allows them to find a projection.
The second stiffening algorithm attempts, based on the diameter of the connector, to determine a measure
of the mesh discretization. This feature is activated by SWLDPRM, SKIN, 1  or CONCTL, SETID, ,SKIN,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The default is a 0 which implies no stiffening. There is an associated stiffening factor SWLDPRM, SCLSKIN&lt;br&gt;
with value = 0.10 as default.
Depending on the complexity of the model and the overall mesh size and the number of connectors within
the model and the diameter of the connectors relative to the mesh, the default value tends to stiffen a
structural model from about 0.4% to about 4%. A value of SCLSKIN=10.0  stiffens coarser mesh models by
about 10% to 11% and finer mesh models by about 2% to 6%.
The contribution of the stiffening algorithm to the overall stiffness of the FEM model eventually reaches a
limit. For example, a very large value SCLSKIN=100  increases the stiffness of the models overall by only
about 0.1% to 2% over the stiffness obtained for SCLSKIN=10 .
For a correlated structural model evaluated at a specific mesh size, with an aim to refine the mesh for some
portion of this model containing connectors, while leaving other portions containing connectors with an
unmodified mesh, it is recommended that you enter the SKIN, 1  and SCLSKIN , real value on the CONCTL&lt;br&gt;
bulk data entry referring to the connectors within the area of the refined mesh. Different refined mesh areas
within the structural model can have different values of SCLSKIN  associated to the specific connectors in each
refined region.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;149 CHAPTER 8

Main Index
For postprocessing of the SKIN  option, for the affected shell elements, an updated EPT table is available after
module MODGM2 . It contains the PSKNSHL  record that correlates the property data of the shells involved and
a list of shell elements for each patch modified.
Detailed Projection Algorithm for Best Possible Projection
1.The Enhanced algorithm applies to the following projection calculations:
a.Find projections of GA/GB for the PARTPAT  format of CWELD  and PROP  format of CFAST .
b.For ELPAT  format of the CWELD  and the ELEM  format of the CFAST , the user has specified the
specific shell elements and therefore no element search for GA/GB projections is required.
Though no search is required, GA/GB, however, must project onto the user specified
EIDA/EIDB .
c.Find projections of the auxiliary grids GAHi/GBHi  for the PARTPAT  and ELPAT  options on the
CWELD  and any CFAST  option respectively.
2.The projection algorithm searches for possible projections from shell elements with shell grids that
are closest to GS. The closest grid may connect to several shell elements; hence, more than one shell
element may get a projection from GS for curved patches. The shell elements with projections from
GS are collected and the selection is based on the SHIDA/SHIDB  pair with the smallest angle between
their normal vectors.
a.The old CWELD/CFAST  algorithm used the first shell elements found to get a projection and used
SWLDPRM, GMCHK , 1 and 2 to provide some control. These two options have no effect on the
new formulation.
b.Backward connections sometimes occur if the patch is near the boundary of a structure, and there
is a vertical flange associated with the patch elements. In this case, SWLDPRM , GMCHK, 3 may
be used to prevent backward projection.
3.The minimum angle selected above must be SWLDPRM GSPROJ if GSPROJ. 0.0
4.If the user has not specified both GA and GB and the algorithm cannot find a GSPROJ  satisfied
projection, then for SWLDPRM GSMOVE  entry, the point GS will be moved in an attempt to satisfy
the projection requirement.
5.Reminder: If user has specified both GA and GB and CFAST  and the CWELD  with options PARTPAT&lt;br&gt;
and ELPAT  are used, then GSMOVE  will be ignored and the connector will fail to connect if the user
has taken the default SWLDPRM, NREDIA, 0  for NREDIA . Failed connectors issue USER FATAL
MESSAGE 7635 .
6.If the GSMOVE  specification limit is reached for the CFAST  or the CWELD  with options PARTPAT  and
ELPAT  and SWLDPRM NREDIA ?‚ 0, then the diameter of the connector will be reduced by half to
compute new locations of auxiliary grids. If necessary this is repeated until the NREDIA  specified value
is reached.
a.When the NREDIA ?‚ 0 is initiated, the GS at its current location is used for GSMOVE . 0 .
b.When the NREDIA ?‚ 0 is initiated, the GS at its original location is used for the new option
GSMOVE &amp;lt; 0 .&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction
SOL 400 supports the following loads and boundary conditions:
•Constrained nodal displacements (zero displacements at specified degrees of freedom). Enforced
nodal displacements (nonzero displacements at specified degrees of freedom in the nodal
coordinate system). Both constrained and enforced displacements can be specified as relative or
absolute.
•Forces applied to nodes in any coordinate system.
•Follower force distributed loads.
•Temperature applied to nodes. Temperature can be applied as a load in a structural analysis. The
reference temperature is user definable.
•Inertial body forces, acceleration and velocity can be applied in the global coordinate system.
Zero and Enforced Displacements
Enforced Motion Constraints (SPCD and SPCR)
SPCD  and SPCR  define an enforced displacement value for static analysis and an enforced displacement,
velocity or acceleration in dynamic analysis. SPCD  provides the final total displacement, velocity, or
acceleration at the end of the current loadcase, and SPCR  determines the incremental displacement, velocity,
or acceleration during the current loadcase, relative to the value of the previous loadcase.
When a GRID  has deformation due to an applied load or motion applied in the previous STEP  and the user
wishes to prescribe displacements in the current STEP  relative to this unknown magnitude, then the SPCR&lt;br&gt;
capability of applying relative motion will provide an efficient procedure.
The primary applications for enforced motion constraints are as follows:
1.To apply a motion accurately on a structure;
2.To apply an incremental motion on a structure;
It should be noted that SPCD /SPCR  are treated as loads. SPC and SPC1  are requested by the SPC Case
Control command, while SPCD  and SPCR  are requested by the LOAD  or DLOAD  Case Control commands.
A degree of freedom referenced by SPCD  must be also on an SPC or SPC1  entry. A degree of freedom
referenced by SPCR  must be also on a SPC1 , but cannot be on an SPC.
SPCR: It defines an enforced relative displacement value for a load step in SOL 400.
SPCD: It defines an enforced displacement value for static analysis and an enforced motion value
(displacement, velocity or acceleration) in dynamic analysis.
Fixed Direction Grid Point Forces
You can categorize a particular type of load as either a point (concentrated) load or surface/volumetric
(distributed) load, depending on application conditions. The spatial distribution of the load can be uniform&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSC Nastran: SOL 400 Getting Started Manual
p-Element Loads and Constraints154
Main Index
or nonuniform. Special loading types also exist in various analyses. For example, centrifugal loading exists in
stress analysis, and convection and radiation exist in heat transfer analysis. You can add point loads directly
to the nodal force vector, but equivalent nodal forces first must be calculated by MSC Nastran from
distributed loads and then added to the nodal force vector.
For detailed information on Grid Point Forces and Grid Point Follower Forces refer to MSC Nastran
Nonlinear (SOL400) User’s guide .
p-Element Loads and Constraints
Point Loads
The FORCE entry is used to define a static load applied to a geometric grid point in terms of components
defined by a local coordinate system. The orientation of the load components depends on the type of local
coordinate system used to define the load. The directions of the load components are the same as those
indicated on Figure 2-2 of Grid Point and Coordinate System Definition, 32 for displacement components.
The FORCE1 entry is used if the direction is determined by a vector connecting two grid points, and a
FORCE2 entry is used if the direction is specified by the cross product of two such vectors. The MOMENT,
MOMENT1 and MOMENT2 entries are used in a similar fashion to define the application of a
concentrated moment at a geometric grid point. The SLOAD entry is used to define a load at a scalar point.
In this case, only the magnitude is specified since only one component of motion exists at a scalar point.
Line and Pressure Loads in p-Element Analysis
The GMLOAD entry is used to specify line and pressure loads as follows:
Applying directly to the finite elements entities, FEEDGEs and FEFACEs.
Applying to the geometry entities GMCURV and GMSURF.
Body Loads
Body loads consists of thermal loads and gravity loads.
For thermal loading, the TEMP Bulk Data entry is used for a temperature distribution that is trilinear over
the element, whereas the TEMPF entry is used over a set of elements. The initial or reference temperature of
a body must be supplied using these entries. Gravity loads are defined by the GRAV entry.
Boundary Conditions
The SPC and SPCD entries are used for the point constraints that are allowed only on corner GRID points.
The GMSPC entry is used to define zero constraints for FEEDGEs, FEFACEs, GMCURVs, and GMSURFs.
For nonzero constraints, the GMBC entry is used. In general, for multiple input data for FEEDGE,
FEFACE, GMCURV, and GMSURF entities, the hierarchy set to resolve these conflicts is as follows:
GRIDs
FEEDGEs
GMCURVs
FEFACEs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;155 CHAPTER 9
Boundary Conditions
Main Index
GMSURFs
Thermal Loads (TEMP and TEMPD)
Thermal loads can be used on a structure to perform stress analysis or to determine thermal expansion. You
must define a temperature distribution via TEMPij  bulk data entries and thermal expansion coefficients.
Thermal expansion coefficients are specified on the material bulk data entries. T emperatures can be specified
at grid points ( TEMP  and TEMPD  bulk data entries in the QRG  and interpolated to grid points within
elements.
Alternatively, temperature data can be specified on an element-by-element basis as shown in Table 9-1.
Average temperatures specified directly for an element take precedence over the temperatures interpolated
from the element’s connected grid points. Solid elements obtain their temperatures only by interpolation
from connected grid points. Note that interpolated grid point temperatures provide temperature gradients
over the neutral surface of shell elements, whereas the TEMPPi  entries do not.
The temperature data and the thermal expansion coefficients are used internally to calculate equivalent forces
and moments acting at the grid points.
The TEMPERATURE  (Case) (INIT ) and TEMPERATURE  (Case) (LOAD ) case control commands specify
the initial temperature and applied temperature, respectively. The TEMP(INIT ) command must appear
either above the first subcase or inside the first subcase.Table 9-1  Bulk Data Entries Used for Temperature Definition on Elements

Inertial and Dynamic Loads156
Main Index
Inertial and Dynamic Loads
Gravity and Centrifugal Force
Gravity (GRAV)
The GRAV  entry is used to define the direction and magnitude of a gravity vector in any user-defined
coordinate system. The components of the gravity vector are multiplied by the mass matrix to obtain the
components of the gravity force at each grid point. Since the mass matrix is used to compute the forces, you
must have mass in your model, typically defined by the density on a material entry. Gravity also includes the
effects of nonstructural mass and lumped mass defined through the CONM1  and CONM2  entries. Note that
the GRAV  entry must have a unique SID-no other loading entry may use the same ID. The LOAD  entry
(discussed in the next section) can be used to combine gravity loading with other types of loading.
Centrifugal (RFORCE)
The RFORCE  entry is used when you need to apply a force to your structure due to rotational velocity and/or
acceleration. On the RFORCE  entry, you input the components of a spin vector that are used internally to
compute centrifugal forces. Each component of the spin vector is multiplied by the same scale factor.
You must select one of two methods for the internal calculation of the loading vector.
Method=1 yields correct results only when there is no coupling in the mass matrix. This occurs when the
lumped mass option is used with or without the ZOFFS  option (see the CQUAD4  entry for a description of
ZOFFS). Method=2 yields correct results for lumped or consistent mass matrix only if the ZOFFS option is
not used. The acceleration terms due to the mass offset (X1, X2, X3) on the CONM2  entry are not computed
with method=2. All the possible combinations of mass matrices and offset and the correct method to be used
are shown in Table 9-2.
In addition, for problems with elements that have edge grid points ( CQUAD8 , CTRIA6 , CTRlAX6 , CHEXA ,
CPENTA , and CTETRA ), correct centrifugal loads are produced only if the parameter
PARAM,COUPMASS,x  (where x is greater than 1), is included in the input file and Method 2 is used.
Note for PARAM,COUPMASS=-1  (the default) the generation of lumped mass matrices that contains only
translational components for the elements listed above. Notable exceptions to this are the CBAR  and CBEAM&lt;br&gt;
elements, both of which will yield rotational and coupling terms in order to preserve the mass center when
element offsets are defined. This offset mass is ‘lumped’ in the sense that it has low matrix rank, and is
‘coupled’ in the sense that there are nonzero off diagonal terms in the mass matrix. The CBEAM  element will Table 9-2  Restrictions when using the RFORCE Entry

also yield a mass moment of inertia about the local X axis of the element, and if NASTRAN BARMASS &amp;gt;0,
then this is also true of the CBAR  element.
In order to yield a lumped mass matrix containing translational components only for the CBAR  and CBEAM&lt;br&gt;
elements, set SYSTEM(414) = 1 , along with the default value for PARAM,COUPMASS (-1) . The default
value (0) for SYSTEM(414)  produces the coupled mass matrices for CBAR  and CBEAM .
Acceleration Loads (ACCEL and ACCEL1)
ACCEL  and ACCEL1  bulk data entries are used to apply an acceleration load that varies across the structure.
The ACCEL  entries apply acceleration loads which may vary over a region of the structural model. The load
variation is based upon the tabular input defined on this bulk data entry. The ACCEL1  entry applies static
acceleration load at individual grid points. The ACCEL  and ACCEL1  bulk data entries in the QRG  are used
in the same way as other load entries (such as GRAV , FORCE , and MOMENT , etc.) through the MSC Nastran
case control commands.
Initial Stress and Initial Plastic Strain Mapping from Previous Results
MSC Nastran allows you to enter a set of initial stresses through the ISTRESS  bulk data entry that simulates
the stress state in the structure at the beginning of an analysis. A typical example is prestress in a tensioned
fabric roof. The set of initial stresses must be self-equilibrating and should not exceed the yield stress of the
material.
MSC Nastran allows you to define the equivalent plastic strain using the IPSTRAIN  bulk data entry
throughout the model. This is useful in metal forming analysis in which the previous amount of equivalent
plastic strain is often required. This history dependent variable represents the amount of plastic deformation
thatthe model was subjected to, and is used in the work (strain) hardening model. This is only used to
determine the value of the strain hardening once plasticity occurs.
Preprocessors such as Patran and SimXpert are very useful in mapping stress states between analyses.&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction
MSC Nastran SOL 400 provides a comprehensive FE solution for multi-physics problems such as structure
analysis, thermal analysis, as well coupled analysis. Even though it is originally targeted to deal with various
nonlinearities as geometry nonlinearity, material nonlinearity, as well boundary nonlinearity (contact), it is
also embedded with the powerful capabilities of MSC Nastran on linear analyses.
The FEM is a powerful tool for analyzing complex problems in structural and continuum mechanics. The
analysis of a structure using the FEM has four basic steps:
1.Modeling, in which the structure is subdivided into an assemblage of discrete volumes called finite
elements, and properties are assigned to each element.
2.Evaluation of element characteristics, such as stiffness and mass matrices, followed by assembling the
element characteristic matrices to obtain the assembled or “global” matrices characteristic of the
entire structure. A similar process is followed to obtain the total loads, in vector form, applied to the
structure.
3.Solution of the system equations for displacements, natural frequencies and mode shapes, or buckling
load factors.
4.Calculating other quantities of interest, such as strains, stresses and strain energy. MSC Nastran SOL
400 provides a comprehensive FE solution for multi-physics problems such as structure analysis,
thermal analysis, as well coupled analysis. Even though it is originally targeted to deal with various
nonlinearities as geometry nonlinearity, material nonlinearity, as well boundary nonlinearity
(contact), it is also embedded with the powerful capabilities of MSC Nastran on linear analyses. The
FEM is a powerful tool for analyzing complex problems in structural and continuum mechanics. The
analysis of a structure using the FEM has four basic steps:
SOL 400 uses the finite element displacement method, in which a system of equations is solved to obtain
the displacements at all node points of the structure. Comprehensive presentations of the FEM together with
numerous applications are available in textbooks and the research literature. Solving the equations of finite
element analysis involves the manipulation of large matrices of numbers, which is best done using computers.
While modern computers are extremely fast and have vast amounts of memory, the “bottom line” in finite
element analysis is that it is very easy to discretize a structure to the point that it is considered to be a “large”
problem.
Typically, the geometry of the problem will dictate how fine of a mesh is required to get an acceptable
solution. While modern graphical user interfaces (GUI&amp;rsquo;s) such as Patran can provide some guidance and tools
for evaluating the mesh density, in the end it is up to the user to ensure that the problem is adequately
discretized. The size of FEA problems is typically measured by the number of degrees of freedom (or degrees
of freedom) in the finite element mesh.
For nonlinear problems, the size is even more important because the methods used to solve these nonlinear
equations are usually iterative in nature, meaning that the system of equations must be solved many, many
times to follow the behavior of the structure as it changes. The changes characterized may be the shape (called
large deformation), or the status of the material (metal materials typically yield when a certain stress level is
exceeded), or loading changes (the load orientation may follow the deformation of the structure, or different
parts of the structure may come into contact changing the load path). The purpose of this chapter is to&lt;/p&gt;

describe the numerical methods and procedures required to solve the linear and nonlinear equations used to
perform finite element simulations.
We begin this chapter with some general observations and recommendations on how to approach the solution
to nonlinear FEA problems, and then move through the details of how to get an accurate, efficient solution
using the algorithms and methods available in MSC Nastran SOL 400. Along with the efficiency, we discuss
the concept of “robustness”, which means choosing alogorithms that will tolerate changes in the problem
(sometimes abrupt, such as contact characterizing impact) with out causing the solution algorithms to fail. A
robust numerical method automates changes in the solution parameters, such as load increment size, as
required by the problem yet still provides a reasonably accurate and efficient solution.
The characteristics of the solution methods and strategies in this chapter include: solution iteration methods,
transient analysis effects such as time step selection, and time integration method, arc-length methods for
post-buckling, and convergence measurements and controls. This chapter may be read as a tutorial, but is
probably best used as a reference when considering specific problems encountered while trying to solve a
nonlinear finite element problem.
Nonlinear Characteristics and General
Recommendations
Modeling for nonlinear analysis is not exempted from the guidelines for good modeling practice pertaining
to linear analysis, which are summarized as follows:
The analyst should have some insight into the behavior of the structure to be modeled; otherwise, a
simple model should be the starting point.
Substructuring should be considered for the modularity of the model and/or synergism between
projects and agencies involved. The structure represented by a substructure is always linear.
The size of the model should be determined based on the purpose of the analysis, the trade-off
between accuracy and efficiency, and the scheduled deadline.
Prior contemplation of the geometric modeling will increase efficiency in the long run. Factors to be
considered include selection of coordinate systems, symmetric considerations for simplification, and
systematic numbering of nodal points and elements for easy classification of locality.
Discretization should be based on the anticipated stress gradient, i.e., a finer mesh in the area of
stress concentrations.
Element types and the mesh size should be judiciously chosen. For example, avoid highly distorted
and/or stretched elements (with high aspect ratio).
The model should be verified prior to the analysis by some visual means, such as plots and graphic
displays.
Nonlinear analysis requires deeper insight into structural behavior. First of all, the type of nonlinearities
involved must be determined. If there is a change in constraints due to contact during loading, the problem
may be classified as a boundary nonlinear problem and would require contact body creation and contact
modeling. The material nonlinearity is characterized by material properties. However, the material nonlinear
effects may or may not be significant depending on the magnitude and duration of the loading, and
occasionally on environmental conditions. The anticipated stress level would be a key to this issue. The
geometric nonlinearity is characterized by large rotations which usually cause large displacements. Intuitively,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;161 CHAPTER 10
Iteration Control in Nonlinear Analysis
Main Index
geometric nonlinear effects should be significant if the deformed shape of the structure appears distinctive
from the original geometry without amplifying the displacements. There is no distinct limit for large
displacements because geometric nonlinear effects are related to the dimensions of the structure and the
boundary conditions. Strain is nondimensional, and a strain greater than 2% indicates a geometrically
nonlinear problem.
Starting the Analysis
Nonlinear analysis is intrinsically a multi-increment load process where the applied loads and/or&lt;br&gt;
displacements are solved for, not in a single load increment but in a number of load increments. The&lt;br&gt;
multiple step procedure is necessary for the FE code to update changing conditions in the model during the
analysis. This situation is routinely encountered in nonlinear analysis because the material properties and/or
boundary conditions can change during the analysis (e.g., with the onset of plasticity (material
nonlinearity)), or with the occurrence of contact (boundary conditions nonlinearity). Below are the steps in
a general linear and a nonlinear analysis. The presence of an extra loop of iterations (Newton-Raphson
iterations) is the unique feature of a nonlinear solution procedure.

Load Increments and Iterations
Load Increments
In the loading history, the total change of loading applied during a step can be subdivided into smaller parts
to allow the solution to converge. These subdivisions within a subcase are termed load increments. The
recommended procedure for SOL 400 nonlinear analyses is to use the adaptive load incrementation process
which is the default method used when the job is set up in Patran. In this case, the number of load increments
is specified in Patran on the Load Increments subform and are defined in the bulk data file by the NINC  field
on the NLSTEP  entry. Selecting fixed incrementation and specifying the number of increments divides the
total load change applied during the subcase into NINC  equal parts for FIXED  load incrementation, but only
provides the initial load increment size in the case of adaptive load incrementation. The automated adaptive
load incrementation method is strongly recommended over the manual method because it gives the
algorithm the freedom to decrease the load when loading changes occur, such as when bodies come into
contact or sudden discontinuities in the loading history occur. These types of changes often cause
convergence problems when fixed stepping algorithms are used. See the NLSTEP  bulk data entry for more
details.
Iterations
In the incremental solution process, the unbalanced forces that occur during a load increment are
reintroduced internally into the solution until the solution has converged. The process of redistributing the
unbalanced force within a load increment is known as an iteration. The iteration is the lowest level of the
solution process. Iterations continue within a load increment until the solution converges or any of the
specified convergence parameters are exceeded. A complete description of the numerical procedure used to
solve the nonlinear problem is given in this chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

Starting the Analysis164
Main Index
Figure 10-2  MSC Nastran Advanced Nonlinear Flow Diagram
The important point to note is that the total load is applied gradually in steps (or increments) and for each
load step, the solution is arrived at after one or more iterations. If the behavior of the model is generally linear,
few iterations are required to solve that load step. If the model behavior is complex/nonlinear, many iterations
might be required. Each iteration involves an assembly and solution of the stiffness matrix. Hence, nonlinear
problems inherently take longer than linear models (of the same size) to solve. At the end of each iteration, a
check is made to see if the solution has converged. If the convergence check fails, the iteration is repeated with
the new information. This process repeats until convergence is achieved. Following that, the next increment
of load is applied. The load increments are applied until the full load of the model is solved.No

Iteration Control in Nonlinear Analysis
Main Index
To achieve accurate results, three key points have to be paid attention to:
Iteration method;
Load increment control; and
Convergence criterion.
The three points will be discussed in later sections.
What Triggers a Nonlinear Analysis in SOL 400
As for MSC Nastran, the model is treated as a nonlinear analysis, if it consists of:
Large displacement by LGDISP parameter (for geometric nonlinearity);
Large strain by LRGSTRN (for geometric nonlinearity);
any contact (boundary nonlinearity);
any active nonlinear material input option (material nonlinearity)
linear perturbation (individual or combined nonlinearities)
or any combination thereof.
The model may contain superelements, but only the residual structure (superelement 0) may consist of
nonlinear elements, mixed with any type of linear elements. As aforementioned, other potentially nonlinear
elements in the residual structure become actively nonlinear only if a LGDISP or LRGSTRN is used and/or
if they use the nonlinear material data specified on any one of the entries: MATEP , MATVE, MATVP ,
MATF ,  MATS1, MATS3, MATS8, MATSORT, MATG, MATHE, MATHP , MATSMA, and MCOHE,
and/or perturbation analyses.
General Recommendations for Nonlinear Analysis
With these points in mind, additional recommendations are imperative for nonlinear analysis:
Identify the type of nonlinearity and localize the nonlinear region for computational efficiency. If
unsure, perform a linear analysis to help understand the problem.
Segregate the linear region by using superelements and/or linear elements if possible. Notice that the
potentially nonlinear elements can be used as linear elements.
The nonlinear region usually requires a finer mesh. Use a finer mesh if severe element distortions or
stress concentrations are anticipated.
The step/subcase structure should be utilized properly to divide the load or time history for
conveniences in data recovery, and database storage control, not to mention changing constraints
and loading paths.
The load or time for the subcase with NLSTEP should then be further divided into increments, for
the purpose of convergence control. Automatic adaptive load incrementation, such as is available via
NLSTEP, is the recommended method.
Many options are available in solution methods to be specified on the NLSTEP data entries. The
defaults should typically be used on all options to gain experience before experimenting with other
options.&lt;/p&gt;

Load Incrementation and Iteration166
Main Index
Normal rotation for the &amp;ldquo;drilling degree of freedom&amp;rdquo; of shell elements restrained by the default value
of 100 on the K6ROT parameter when the geometric nonlinearity is involved. In rare cases it may
be necessary to adjust this value. This can help with convergence, but may also affect the results.
Understand the basic theory of plasticity, creep, or rubber elasticity before using these capabilities.
The time step size for a transient response analysis should be carefully considered based on the
highest natural frequency of interest because it has significant effects on the efficiency as well as the
accuracy of the solution. The automated procedures used by NLSTEP is adequate for this purpose.
Load Incrementation and Iteration
Nonlinear Solution Procedure
Based on the extensive numerical experiments, an attempt was made to establish a robust, general strategy
suitable for most problems without requiring insight or experience. Variations in combining theories,
algorithms, criteria, and parameter values with numerous test problems resulted in a succinct
implementation.
The major feature of the nonlinear analysis is the requirement for the incremental and iterative processes to
obtain a solution. The main issue is how to choose the most efficient method from the options available for
the incremental and iterative processes in the solution of nonlinear equilibrium equations. The increment size
for loads or time steps has the most significant effect on the efficiency and the accuracy of the computation,
particularly in the path-dependent problems. The incremental and iterative processes are complementary to
each other because the larger the increment size the more iterations the solution requires. While an excessively
small increment reduces the computing efficiency without any significant improvement in accuracy, a large
increment may deteriorate the efficiency as well as the accuracy; it may even cause divergence.
It is impossible to optimize the incremental step size in the absence of prior knowledge of the structural
response. The NLSTEP  adaptive load incrementation procedure should be exercised to determine the
increment size based on the severity of the nonlinearity. Needless to say, no incremental load steps are required
when the response is linear. In principle, the size of the load increment (or time increment for creep analysis)
should be so chosen to yield a uniform rate of change in strains or stresses for the material nonlinear problems
and a uniform rate of change in displacements for geometric nonlinear problems. Some adaptive method
controls are available via NLSTEP , such as an automatic time step adjustment criteria and bisection/cut-back
of loads upon divergence. The default method is to use the initial load increment value specified on the
NLSTEP  entry, then increase or decrease the size if the number of iterations required to converge varies
significantly from the NDES  value. If substantially more than NDES  iterations are required the time step size
is decreased. Conversely, if substantially more iterations than NDES  are required the time step size will be
decreased. The magnitude of increase/decrease is controlled by the SFACT  value.
The increment size can be varied from step to step by specifying different NLSTEP . It is recommended to
define separate NLSTEP  for every step even if the same values are specified, so that changes can be
accommodated in the step level as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;167 CHAPTER 10
Iteration Control in Nonlinear Analysis

Adaptive Solution Strategies
Nonlinear finite element computations comprise material processes, element force computations, and
various global solution strategies. The computational procedure involves incremental and iterative processes
ranging from local subincrements to global solution processes. Performance of the finite element program
can be scrutinized from three different perspectives: computational efficiency, solution accuracy and
effectiveness. All of these attributes of the nonlinear program can be improved by adaptive algorithms.
There is a broad range of processes for which adaptive algorithms may be adopted in the computational
procedure of nonlinear finite element analysis. The size of the load or time increment has the most profound
effect on the efficiency as well as accuracy. However, it is difficult to determine optimal load or time
increment size. The adaptive algorithm alleviates this difficulty. The most CPU consuming processes in
nonlinear analysis are the stiffness matrix update operation and element force calculation. From the efficiency
point of view, the number of stiffness matrix updates and the number of iterations should be minimized,
which may be conflicting requirements.
Adaptive features implemented in MSC Nastran nonlinear capabilities are:
Newton&amp;rsquo;s iteration for static and implicit dynamic analysis
•Adaptive stiffness matrix update strategies
•Selective BFGS updates
•Selective line search processes
•Adaptive bisection and recovery of load increment
 Arc-length methods for static post-buckling and snap-through problems
•Crisfield&amp;rsquo;s arc-length method
•Riks and modified Riks methods
•Adaptive arc-length adjustment
•Selective BFGS Updates
•Adaptive switching algorithm for limiting cases
•Adaptive correction in case of path reversal
Direct time integration for transient response analysis
• Quadratically accurate dynamic operators
• Automatic time step adjustment
Load Increment Size
Selecting a proper load step (time step) increment is an important aspect of a nonlinear solution scheme.
Large steps often lead to many recycles per increment and, if the step is too large, it can lead to inaccuracies
or even nonconvergence. On the other hand, using too small steps is inefficient.
The NLSTEP  bulk data entry provides a unified load stepping scheme that replaces existing options entries
such as NLPARM , TSTEPNL , NLPCI , and NLSTEP . This option can be used for statics and dynamic
analyses, to select fixed or adaptive time stepping control, and to define the convergence criteria, as well to&lt;/p&gt;

make other options for mechanical, thermal and coupled analysis. MSC has made every attempt to make
MSC Nastran SOL 400 as robust, efficient, and user friendly as possible; especially when used with either of
the MSC graphical user interfaces (GUI’s) Patran or SimXpert. For many problems the defaults entered are
appropriate to minimize the job setup and obtain accurate results.
The NLSTEP  option has a keyword CTRLDEF that automatically sets up the entries for the time stepping
adjustment and convergence tolerance based upon how nonlinear you believe the problem is. This makes it
possible to use smart default based on users’ judgment of the nonlinearity of the model to be analyzed.
Under the keyword CTRLDEF , these three options ( QLINEAR , MILDLY , and SEVERELY ) adjust the parameter
to provide you the desired results. As the names imply, CTRLDEF  should be set to QLINEAR  for linear
solutions, MILDLY  for mildly nonlinear, and SEVERELY  for severely nonlinear behavior.
Fixed Load Incrementation
When a fixed load stepping scheme is used, it is important to select an appropriate load step size that captures
the loading history and allows for convergence within a reasonable number of recycles. For complex load
histories, it is often necessary to break up the analysis into separate load cases with different step sizes. For
fixed stepping, there is an option to have the load step automatically bisect/cut back in case of failure to obtain
convergence. When an increment diverges, the intermediate deformations after each recycle can show large
fluctuations and the final cause of program exit can be any of the following: maximum number of recycles
reached, elements going inside out or, in a contact analysis, nodes sliding off a rigid contact body (see
Chapter 6: Setting Up, Monitoring, and Debugging the Analysis  for more on user fatal messages and their causes). These
deformations are normally not visible as post results. If the cutback feature is activated and one of these
failures occurs, the state of the analysis at the end of the previous increment is restored from a copy kept in
memory or disk, and the increment is subdivided into a number of sub-increments. The step size is halved
until convergence is obtained or the user -specified number of cutbacks has been performed. Once a sub-
increment is converged, the analysis continues to complete the rest of the original increment. No results are
written to the results file during sub-incrementation. When the original increment is finished, the calculation
continues to the next increment with the original increment count maintained. These issues are avoided by
using the NLSTEP  increment option. The adaptive load incrementation procedure of NLSTEP , using the
MSC Nastran defaults, is the recommended method for load incrementation.
Adaptive Load Incrementation in SOL 400 (NLSTEP)
An NLSTEP  entry can be selected to execute a nonlinear static or nonlinear transient analysis in SOL 400.
An NLSTEP  entry is used in lieu of an NLPARM  or TSTEPNL  used in earlier solution sequences (SOL 106
or SOL 129) or both. If a NLSTEP  is present anywhere in a STEP , then any NLPARM  or TSTEPNL  entries
in the STEP  is ignored. When used for coupled analysis, the NLSTEP  entry must be above the first
SUBSTEP  command. A single NLSTEP  entry is used for all SUBSTEP s of the STEP .
NLSTEP Bulk Data Entry
The following section gives a description of the most commonly used parameters of NLSTEP . A complete
description of all parameters can be found in the QRG  under the NLSTEP  entry.&lt;/p&gt;

Convergence Controls
Three methods are available for determining if convergence is obtained on any given iteration: residual force,
displacement, and strain energy. You can select one of these three criteria for convergence or you may specify
a combination of residual and displacement. The AND  combination signals that both residual and
displacement must be met, while the OR combination specifies that either one can satisfy convergence
criteria. If you are using residual there may be cases in which the force residuals are null in which case is it
necessary to switch over to displacement. An Autoswitching option (on by default) allows for this switching.
The default measure for convergence in SOL 400 is residual which is based on the magnitude of the
maximum residual load compared to the maximum reaction force. This method is appropriate since the
residuals measure the out-of-equilibrium force, which should be minimized. This technique is also
appropriate for Newton methods, where zero-load iterations reduce the residual load. The method has the
additional benefit that convergence can be satisfied without iteration. You have complete control over how
convergence is defined through the Iterations Parameters form in Patran or through the options on the
NLSTEP  entry.
The basic procedures are outlined below.
1.Residual checking: Residual checking has one drawback. In some special problems, such as free
thermal expansion, there are no reaction forces. If the value of the residuals and reactions is less than
1.e-6, this test is ignored. If the AUTOSW  flag on the NLSTRAT  entry is ON, the program automatically
uses displacement checking in this cases.
2.Displacement checking: With this method, convergence is satisfied if the maximum displacement of
the last iteration is small compared to the actual displacement change of the increment. If the value
of the incremental and iterative displacement is less than 1.e-8, this test is ignored. A disadvantage of
this approach is that it results in at least one iteration, regardless of the accuracy of the solution.
3.Strain energy checking: This is similar to displacement testing where a comparison is made between
the strain energy of the latest iteration and the strain energy of the increment. With this method, the
entire model is checked. A disadvantage of this approach is that it results in at least one iteration,
regardless of the accuracy of the solution. The advantage of this method is that it evaluates the global
accuracy as opposed to the local accuracy associated with a single node.
4.Residual  or displacement checking : This procedure does convergence checking on both residuals
(Residual  1) and displacements (Procedure 2). Convergence is obtained if one converges.
5.Residual  and displacement checking : This procedure does a convergence check on both residuals and
displacements (Procedure 4). Convergence is achieved if both criteria converge simultaneously.
Different problems require different schemes to detect the convergence efficiently and accurately. To do this,
the combinations of residual checking and displacement checking are also available (as mentioned in the last
two steps.&lt;/p&gt;
