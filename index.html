<p>Hello 大家好</p>
<p>NASTRAN is a finite element analysis (FEA) program that was originally developed for NASA in the late 1960s under United States government funding for the aerospace industry.
The MacNeal-Schwendler Corporation (MSC) was one of the principal and original developers of the publicly available NASTRAN code.[1][2] NASTRAN source code is integrated in a number of different software packages, which are distributed by a range of companies.
